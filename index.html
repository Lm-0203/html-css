      On December 29, 2022, Treasury published a notice of intent to propose
      regulations containing information for consumers and manufacturers in
      advance of the January 1, 2023, effective date of changes to the clean
      vehicle credit under section 30D of the tax code. The notice of intent
      provided an expected vehicle classification standard, based on existing
      EPA CAFE standards, for the purpose of determining whether the vehicle is
      a sedan, SUV, or other type of vehicle and subject to the $55,000 or
      $80,000 MSRP limitation. To make it easier for consumers to know which
      vehicles qualify under the applicable MSRP cap, Treasury is updating the
      vehicle classification standard to use the consumer-facing EPA Fuel
      Economy Labeling standard, rather than the EPA CAFE standard. This change
      will allow crossover vehicles that share similar features to be treated
      consistently. It will also align vehicle classifications under the clean
      vehicle credit with the classification displayed on the vehicle label and
      on the consumer-facing website FuelEconomy.gov. Customers who have
      purchased and placed in service vehicles since January 1, 2023, that
      qualify under the EPA Fuel Economy Labeling classification standard
      announced today and who satisfy the other clean vehicle tax credit
      requirements can claim the credit, including customers with vehicles that
      did not qualify under the

      prior EPA CAFE standard. All vehicles that were eligible under the MSRP
      limitations prior to today’s notice remain eligible under the updated
      standard. Updated information about the MSRP limit that applies has been
      posted to IRS.gov. As outlined in December, subsequent guidance on
      critical minerals and batteries will be issued in March. BACKGROUND ON
      TREASURY’S WORK TO IMPLEMENT THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT Since the
      Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August 2022, Treasury has
      worked expeditiously to write the rules that will make real the promise of
      this legislation. Within days of the law’s enactment, Treasury issued
      guidance on the clean vehicle tax credit and worked closely with the
      Departments of Energy and Transportation so consumers could easily find a
      list of eligible vehicles online. In the fall of 2022, Treasury held a
      series of stakeholder discussions with Secretary Janet L. Yellen and
      Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo to solicit input from key groups
      representing millions of workers, thousands of companies, and trillions of
      dollars in investment assets, as well as climate and environmental justice
      advocates, community-based organizations, and other key actors that are
      critical to the success of the Inflation Reduction Act. Treasury also
      hosted three formal consultations with Tribal governments and Alaska
      Native Corporations to hear first-hand from Tribal leaders about
      provisions in the law that directly affect Tribal nations. In addition,
      Treasury has solicited and is reviewing thousands of public comments from
      trade associations, carmakers, labor groups, state and municipal leaders,
      consumers, foreign governments, utility companies, climate advocacy
      organizations, think tanks, and more. In November, Treasury published
      initial guidance on the prevailing wage and apprenticeship standards,
      which went into effect on January 29, 2023. In December, Treasury and the
      IRS set out key procedures for manufacturers and sellers of clean vehicles
      that are required for vehicles to be eligible for tax incentives. Treasury
      and the IRS then released initial guidance to provide clarity for
      consumers and businesses to access the credit on January 1, 2023. Treasury
      also released a white paper on the anticipated direction of upcoming
      proposed guidance on the critical minerals and battery components
      requirements for clean vehicles. Lastly in December, Treasury and the IRS
      issued guidance on the new Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) credit and FAQs
      on energy efficient home improvement projects and residential clean energy
      property credits. For more information on Treasury’s implementation work
