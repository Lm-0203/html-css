      Starting today, fans can sign up for MLS Season Pass, the unprecedented
      subscription service now available on the Apple TV app in more than 100
      countries and regions. To get ready for the 2023 Major League Soccer
      season, fans can enjoy a wide variety of free on-demand content that
      celebrates the action, excitement, and distinct culture of MLS, including
      content from MLS clubs, 2023 player profiles, the best league and club
      highlights from the 2022 season, full replays of classic matches, and
      documentary-style vignettes. Once the season kicks off on February 25, MLS
      Season Pass will feature every live MLS regular-season match, the entire
      Audi MLS Cup Playoffs, and Leagues Cup1 all in one place, with consistent
      match times and no blackouts — a first in live sports broadcasting. With
      an MLS Season Pass subscription, fans can enjoy every MLS match on
      billions of devices through the Apple TV app on Apple devices, smart TVs,
      streaming devices, set-top boxes, and game consoles, as well as on the web
      at tv.apple.com. “Having accessibility is huge for the sport. It’s going
      to help grow MLS not only domestically, but internationally. You’ll have
      eyes all over watching our games,” said Kellyn Acosta, Los Angeles
      Football Club’s midfielder. “We talk about how we want the league to
      continue to grow and bridge the gap in comparison with other leagues, and
      I think having this Apple partnership is a step in the right direction.
      Leading into the World Cup in 2026, you want to build momentum and gain
      more exposure, and I think this partnership is going to truly be
      beautiful. I know my family is excited to have all the games in one place,
      and I think it’s going to be huge for the league and for the sport in the
      US.” “It never really crossed my mind that a partnership like this would
      really alleviate a lot of those stresses for so many of our fans, our
      families, our friends, and for the players too, because we watch MLS all
      the time,” said Mark-Anthony Kaye, Toronto FC’s midfielder. “So it’s a
      good feeling to know that the league understands these issues and has done
      a really good job to put a deal together that can put us in a better
      position to bring MLS to the world. I’ve only been in the league for six
      years, but the amount of growth is mind-blowing. So I think this is only
      scratching the surface with this Apple deal, and I’m really happy that
      they’ve done it.”Starting today, fans can sign up for MLS Season Pass, the
