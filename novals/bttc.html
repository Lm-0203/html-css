        Yan Xie got out of the police car and slowly crossed his arms as he eyed
        the shop sign before his eyes.

        Ma Xiang went up to greet him, “Yan-ge, the one who reported the case is

      <p>
        On the <span class="word" title="人行道">sidewalk</span> outside the
        store, a police officer was recording a statement from Jiang Ting, who
        was seated on a bench. He was

      </p>
      <p>

        in response to Jiang Ting’s words. Unexpectedly, someone

        him on the shoulder. “Hey, Vice-Captain Yan!”
      </p>
      <p>Yan Xie gestured with his hand and said, “Leave this to me.”</p>
      <p>
        The officer let out a surprised “oh” and handed over the statement

        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Yan Xie showed no interest towards the records he held in his

      <p>“Hello, Officer Yan,” Jiang Ting greeted politely.</p>

        “The police bureau has yet to offer rewards, yet you’re providing us
        with leads this early. What a shame.”

      <p>Yan Xie was silent.</p>

        The next few seconds passed in silence, their gazes locked onto each
        other. It was Yan Xie who broke the silence first.

        “Feng Yuguang was a post-graduate student from a
        <span class="word" title="著名的;闻名的;有名的;受尊敬的">renowned</span>

        Jiang Ting let out a low

        he ran into the freezer.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “So, do you have any

      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Ting looked at Yan Xie questioningly, a look of perfectly

        “None. This question of yours seems a little…”
      </p>
      <p>“Then what’s with the ‘I see’?”</p>
      <p>“…”</p>
      <p>
        Yan Xie remarked coldly, “I only mentioned addictive drugs, yet you

        It was already five A.M. in the morning, and the sky was beginning to
        lighten up. Deciding to abandon the idea of sleeping, Yan Xie opened Hu
        Weisheng’s case file to
        <span title="/ pəˈruːz / 详细考察；精读" class="word">peruse</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hu Weisheng was a textbook example of the saying, ‘a child who steals a
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈniːd(ə)l / 缝衣针；编织针；注射针; 针"
          >needle</span

        will grow up to steal gold’. He had gone through

          >petty</span

        theft. After he came of age, he moved on to stealing purses, mobile
        phones and electric bicycles, and was
        <span class="word" title="/ ɪmˈprɪznd / 被封印，被囚禁的"
          >imprisoned</span
        >
        a couple of times as a result. A few years ago, he was involved in a
        more serious case in Gongzhou and was
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ˈsentənst / v. 判决；审判；宣判（sentence 的过去式，过去分词）"

      </p>
      <p>
        Yan Xie ran a hand over the
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈstʌbl / 胡子茬，发茬，须茬">stubbles</span>
        on his chin, then gave a low cry of surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hu Weisheng was a street thief, and his targets were always
        <span class="phrase" title="随身物品">personal belongings</span>. He had
        no records of
        <span class="phrase" title="非法闯入 入室盗窃"
          >breaking and entering</span
        >. Judging from this point alone, he was probably a
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈkaʊərd / 胆小鬼，懦夫">coward</span>, and
        the nature of his crimes was
        <span class="word" title="内在地，固有地">inherently</span> different
        from the rape that he was <span class="word">convicted</span> of. This
        act of his that “<span class="word" title="过界"
          >crossed boundaries</span
        >” was very suspicious indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Staring at the word ‘Gongzhou’ in the case file, something
        <span class="word" title="/ stɜːrd / 搅拌，搅和">stirred</span>
        within the depths of his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yan-ge.” Suddenly, Ma Xiang
        <span class="word" title="/ poʊk / 戳，刺；从……露出（或伸出、探出）"
          >poked</span

        his head in. “That top chemistry student has been

        >
        in the bureau for almost 24 hours. Should we release him?”
      </p>
      <p>Yan Xie raised his head in surprise. “What? He’s still here?”</p>
      <p>
        “The forensic team failed to
        <span class="word" title="恢复">recover</span> any footage from the lab,

      </p>
      <p>
        Ma Xiang flashed an ‘OK’ sign at Yan Xie and said, “No problem. The top
        student had already said he won’t file a complaint, we just need to
        hurry up and send him back to the lab.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Yan Xie gave a wave and gestured at Ma Xiang to make a move and close
        the door behind him.

        Liu Xue, eighteen years old, was a student from a renowned high school
        in Gongzhou.
      </p>
      <p>
        A day before the start of
        <span class="word" title="第二次模拟考试">the second mock exam</span>,
        this third year student took advantage of the
        <span class="phrase" title="午休">noon break</span> to
        <span title="/ sniːk / 偷偷地走，潜行；偷带，私运 ">sneak</span> out of
        the school
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈdɔːrmətɔːri / 集体宿舍">dormitories</span>
        and disappeared for the entire afternoon. That night, the school
        launched a search effort that lasted the entire night but to no
        <span class="word" title="/ əˈveɪl / n. 效用，利益">avail</span>. Her
        parents lodged a police report the following day. In less than a day,
        this missing persons case attracted the full attention of the local
        police station and was soon
        <span class="word" title="转移">transferred</span> over to the district
        bureau.
      </p>
      <p>The district bureau accepted the case.</p>
      <p>
        The following night, based on a series of investigations, the police
        found an
        <span class="word" title="昏迷的，不省人事的；">unconscious</span> Liu
        Xue in an unlicensed
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈklɪnɪk / 诊所，门诊部">clinic</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈsʌbsɪkwənt / 随后的，接着的"
          >subsequent</span

        investigation, the suspect Hu Weisheng chanced upon Liu Xue when the
        latter was

        and he immediately
        <span class="word" title="/ lʊr / 引诱，诱惑">lured</span> her into the
        car and drugged her. Unexpectedly, Liu Xue was

        to the drug he
        <span class="word" title="/ ədˈmɪnɪstəd / 注射 执行">administered</span>
        and she immediately developed a series of symptoms such as
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈdɪzinəs / 头晕；头昏眼花 ">dizziness</span>
        and
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈvɑːmɪtɪŋ / 呕吐（vomit 的 ing 形式）"
          >vomiting</span
        >. She eventually
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈfeɪntɪd / 晕厥（faint 的过去式和过去分词）"
          >fainted</span
        >. Hu Weisheng was afraid that he would be
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈɪmplɪkeɪtɪd / 牵连">implicated</span> if an
        <span class="word" title="/ ˌæksəˈdent(ə)l / 意外的，偶然的"

        <span class="word" title="/ ˈbrɪskli / 迅速地；活泼地；尖刻地"
          >briskly</span
        >
        left her at an unlicensed clinic and left.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nature of this case was ruled as attempted rape. After Liu Xue was
        <span title="撤销 出院">discharged</span> from the
        <span class="phrase" title="医院治疗">hospital post-treatment</span>, Hu
        Weisheng was sentenced to three years imprisonment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Staring at the case file, Yan Xie could not believe his eyes—it was
        simply ruled as such?
      </p>
      <p>
        What was the real cause of the victim’s allergic reaction? What was the
        drug administered? Were there no other reasons for a man to drug a woman
        other than rape? If he really
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ˈhɑːrbər / 庇护；窝藏；怀有；为……提供庇护；入港停泊；居住，生存"
          >harbored</span
        >
        the intention to rape her, then why did the
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈreɪpɪst / 强奸犯">rapist</span>
        <span class="word" title="恐慌">panic</span> after she lost
        consciousness and send her straight to a clinic?
      </p>
      <p>
        It had only been less than a month since the case was
        <span class="word" title="/ faɪld / 申请；存档（file 的过去分词形式）"
          >filed</span

          >referred</span
        >
        to the district bureau. There was obviously more to the case than meets
        the eye but the case was inexplicably resolved with such
        <span class="word" title="/ heɪst / 仓促，急忙">haste</span>. Did none
        of the investigators involved in this case raise their suspicions
        regarding this unusual matter?

      <p>The lead investigator of this case then was called Jiang Ting.</p>
      <p>
        From the depths of his memories, a large shadow surfaced. In that split
        second, the

        Yan Xie’s dreams turned around to face him quietly.

        This was the only time the

        and retorted, “Are you still not done with that? Is this even related to
        the 502 Frozen
        <span class="word" title="/ kɔːrps / 尸体">Corpse</span> case that
        you’re investigating right now”

      <p>“Yes,” Yan Xie replied.</p>

      <p>
        “The lead investigator of this case back then was Jiang Ting,” Yan Xie

        gaze at Wei Yao. “Three years ago, there was a chain of explosions at
        the crime scene of the drug

        Under Yan Xie’s firm and unwavering tone, Wei Yao’s
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈfjʊri / 暴怒，狂怒；">fury</span> slowly
        dissipated and he began to seriously

          >contemplate</span
        >
        Yan Xie’s words. After a while, he pulled up a chair and sat down across
        from Yan Xie.
      </p>

        heavily, Wei Yao said, “The total amount of drugs seized during that
        <span class="word" title="禁毒行动">anti-drug operation</span> weighed
        over 80 kilograms.”
      </p>

        However, Wei Yao’s following sentence was a

      <p>
        “According to the original plan, Jiang Ting was supposed to bring enough
        firepower and a

      </p>

      <p>
        “The drug traffickers and their buyers were already gone before the
        police arrived, and the bombs were rigged beforehand,” Wei Yao intoned
        solemnly. “Jiang Ting’s inexplicable sudden change of plans was akin to
        personally sending his comrades into hell.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Bewildered, Yan Xie asked, “Why did they run? Was the information
        leaked?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “After the incident, a lot of people were suspicious about that, to the
        extent that some believed Jiang Ting’s change of plans was an act of
        collusion between him and the drug traffickers. But this suspicion was
        hard to prove because Jiang Ting himself had died and the fire spread
        very quickly as well. The corpse couldn’t even be retrieved in the end.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Having said all that, Wei Yao paused, then asked curiously, “Why? Do you
        suspect that he didn’t die?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie slowly leaned back into his seat, a distant look in his eyes. A
        few seconds later, he cleared his throat and gave a light cough. “Of
        course not.”
      </p>

      <p>
        There seemed to be something on the tip of Wei Yao’s tongue but he
        resisted the urge and swallowed the words back down, directing a probing
        gaze at Yan Xie instead. “Then why did you ask me earlier on if he
        really died?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “…I was just curious why he wasn’t commended as a martyr posthumously.
        Earlier on, I noticed that the others from Gongzhou’s Narcotics Unit
        Second Team who sacrificed their lives were all commended. Even if it
        was a severe misjudgement on his end, the fact remains that he was
        sacrificed in the line of duty. It couldn’t be to the extent where they
        weren’t even willing to give him an award.”
      </p>

      <p>
        This was just a series of passing remarks made by Yan Xie, but Wei Yao’s
        expression suddenly turned complicated. He deliberated for a moment,
        then said, “It’s because of that undercover agent.”
      </p>

      <p>Yan Xie made a querying noise.</p>

      <p>
        “After the explosion, Gongzhou’s Public Security Unit set up a special
        investigations team. After a thorough investigation of the operations
        and events of that night, they discovered one thing—remember the mole I
        mentioned who provided them with the two locations?”
      </p>

      <p>Unconsciously, Yan Xie’s brows were beginning to furrow.</p>

      <p>
        “This undercover agent was codenamed ‘Rivet’, and it had already been a
        few years since his infiltration. Although he did not manage to climb up
        the ranks to be by the leader’s side, codenamed ‘Big K’, he was once
        close to the second-in-command. As a result, he used to provide a lot of
        valuable leads and had been Gongzhou’s Narcotics Unit’s most valuable
        source of information.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “After the explosions at the plastics plant, it was suspected that there
        was a leak within the police force. Rivet was also at risk of being
        exposed, hence the special investigations team made the urgent decision
        to put together a small task force to extricate him. However, by the
        time they figured out his location and rushed over, it was already too
        late. Rivet had been killed by the drug traffickers, his corpse burnt to
        ashes. The rescue operation was a failure.”
      </p>

      <p>Wei Yao gave a long sigh, and Yan Xie’s expression grew heavier.</p>

      <p>
        “After Rivet’s death, the special investigations team retrieved the
        computer he had used before and found out that he had forwarded an
        encrypted email to the police containing details of the drug syndicate.
        When decrypted, a portion of the syndicate’s trading chart was revealed,
        detailing all the hidden drugs and firearms in the eco-park’s
        plantation. That is to say, as the lead investigator of the case, it was
        impossible that Jiang Ting did not see the email beforehand. Therefore,
        his act of pulling the elite team from their original assignment and
        moving them to the plastic factory that resulted in the deaths of more
        than ten agents became extremely suspicious.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s a high chance he did it intentionally,” muttered Yan Xie in a
        barely audible tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yes,” Wei Yao said gravely, “the syndicate’s own mole within the police
        force could also have been Jiang Ting himself.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie lapsed into silence. The atmosphere between them suddenly turned
        coarse, as though there were a million small blades in the air, lightly
        scraping across his face from time to time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two of them sat across from each other for a long while before Yan
        Xie intoned in a low voice, “Back then, after that case which we
        cooperated with Gongzhou on concluded and the report was made, someone
        came to find me for a talk. Their request was for me to voluntarily hand
        the credit to a ‘well-connected individual’ in Gongzhou. I was young and
        brash, full of vigor, so I refused. In the end, I was lectured in turn
        by various people for half a month. It felt like the whole world was
        against me. Everyday, resentment brewed in my chest, and I was
        overwhelmed with the urge to destroy that entire City Bureau to bits.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Deputy Commissioner Wei covered his cough with a hand over his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I pulled a long face everywhere and behaved unreasonably. This
        continued until two days before the award ceremony, when suddenly
        Gongzhou sent word that their Commander-in-Chief had eventually signed
        the report and accredited the case to me, and even gave me a
        second-class merit.” Yan Xie let out a soft exhale. “The
        Commander-in-Chief during the operation then was Jiang Ting.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As the elder between the two, Wei Yao had a more pertinent way of
        looking at the matter. “People are multifaceted. It’s good that you
        harbour gratitude towards him, but anything that happens after should be
        viewed as separate issues.”
      </p>

      <p>“No, it’s not gratitude,” Yan Xie said resolutely. “None at all.”</p>

      <p>Wei Yao was confused.</p>

      <p>
        However, Yan Xie did not deign to elaborate on his thoughts. Instead, he
        murmured, “I just can’t figure Jiang Ting out.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Patting his shoulder, Wei Yao responded, “The man is already dead.
        Although there was no final judgement passed, thinking about it more
        will get you nowhere. Keep everything that I told you today to yourself
        . After all, it’s an unsolved case in Gongzhou and people are still
        sensitive about it. It won’t do you any good if word spreads.”
      </p>

      <p>Yan Xie was silent.</p>

      <p>
        The phone on the desk began to ring. “Vice-Captain Yan! We’ve arrested
        that bastard Hu Weisheng and we’re almost at the bureau!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go ahead and work on your tasks.” Wei Yao straightened from his seat.
        “Any drug-related case will not be a small matter. We must get to the
        root of the source, trace through the downlines and the entire network,
        as well as capture the suspect and all their associates in one fell
        swoop. If you can uncover the truth behind the attempted rape case in
        Gongzhou, you must grab hold of the chance, understand?”
      </p>

      <p>“Understood,” Yan Xie affirmed.</p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie personally sent Deputy Commissioner Wei out of his office. He
        stood at the exit of the stairwell, watching as Wei Yao entered the
        elevator. Not long after, a clamouring emerged from the lower level as
        the sounds of cars, footsteps and conversations neared. The officers who
        had picked up the suspect from his den at first light had returned.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yan-<em>ge</em>!” Ma Xiang poked his head out from the end of the
        corridor, pursing his lips in the direction of the interrogation room.
        “Let’s go together?”
      </p>

      <p>Yan Xie raised his hand and beckoned to Ma Xiang.</p>

      <p>
        Bemused, Ma Xiang jogged over, only to hear Yan Xie whisper beside his
        ear, “Call Vice-Captain Qin from the room over and interrogate Hu

      </p>

      <p>“You’re heading to…”</p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie gave his back a light pat. “Call me if you need me,” he said
        over his shoulder, making his way down the flight of stairs. After
        heading down a couple of steps, he
        <span title="突然" class="word">abruptly</span> came to a stop as he
        seemed to recall something.

      <p>
        On the screen, Jiang Ting’s calm and cold gaze was staring into the
        distance. The corners of his pale lips were slightly downturned. He was
        like a
        <span title="雕塑 ˈskəlpCHər" class="word">sculpture</span> dressed up
        in a police uniform,

      <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
      <p>
        It was nine in the morning. Beneath the shade of the trees, a silver
        Mercedes-Benz came to a screeching halt outside the doorway of the
        private sanatorium.
      </p>
      <p>
        “There’s still half an hour to go,” Yang Mei said, turning around in her
        seat to look at Jiang Ting. “Shall I wait with you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No need. This is just a routine check-up. It’s not like I’m crippled.”
        Jiang Ting unfastened his seat belt and got out of the car. “Go ahead
        and do your own thing.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yang Mei hastily rolled down the car window. “Then once you’re done,
        wait for me to come pick you up!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Making his way into the lobby of the sanatorium, Jiang Ting raised his
        hand and gave a light wave without looking back.
      </p>

      <p>
        The face-full of peach blossom make-up that Yang Mei had deliberately
        applied for today drooped as she let out a sigh of frustration. She
        could only resign herself to fate, driving off into the distance.
      </p>

      <p>
        She failed to notice that, in her rear view mirror, a black Grand
        Cherokee rolled to a silent stop in the exact same spot she just
        vacated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sitting in the driver’s seat, Yan Xie extinguished his cigarette as his
        eyes followed the trail of Yang Mei’s disappearing tail lights amongst
        the traffic. When her car left his line of sight, he turned his gaze to
        the sanatorium across the road.
      </p>

      <p>“Here’s your porridge and side dishes!”</p>

      <p>
        The breakfast cafe on the first floor of the inpatient building did not
        have many customers at this time. Jiang Ting chose a corner seat in the
        cafe. Keeping a careful eye on his watch, he split a pair of disposable
        wooden chopsticks.
      </p>

      <p>
        In his early years as an investigator, he would often work round the
        clock without rest. It was normal for him to have irregular mealtimes,
        which gave rise to gastric problems. After reaching a certain age, the
        debt of neglect owed to the body in its early years would be paid back
        multifold. Having suffered the adverse effects of low blood sugar
        several times, Jiang Ting was finally afraid of treating the matter of
        his three meals too nonchalantly and forced himself to develop the habit
        of filling his stomach with something warm every morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        His phone on the table vibrated briefly. It was a message from Yang Mei
        that read, “Have you had breakfast?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Ting typed out a one-word affirmative.</p>

      <p>
        As he sent off his reply, he suddenly caught sight of something out of
        the corner of his eye and looked up.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the other end of the cafe, not far from him, a gaze was unable to be
        withdrawn in time and in that split second, their eyes locked.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a man in his forties, donned in a white short-sleeved t-shirt and
        a baseball cap. He had a tall and burly figure, with muscles rippling
        across his shoulders. The brim of his cap was pulled low, making it hard
        to discern any features from a distance. Their gazes only crossed for a
        brief moment before the man lowered his head to continue his meal,
        nonchalantly flipping a page of his newspaper, as though everything that
        happened earlier was just a coincidence and nothing was out of the
        ordinary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting’s eyes flickered slightly as his gaze roved over the rest of
        the dining area, his expression unchanging.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few minutes later, putting aside his half-eaten porridge and barely
        touched side dishes, he got up to pay and left.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your body’s muscle tone must have been in a good condition before your
        accident, seeing how it didn’t deteriorate much despite being bedridden
        for three years. Your blood pressure is in the normal range as well.
        After you were discharged, did you experience any dizziness, backache or
        muscle aches?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the examination room, Jiang Ting lay supine on the white
        examination bed, fingers interlaced over his abdomen. “I occasionally
        get cramps after a long walk.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor nodded. “That’s normal. Let’s stick to the original
        rehabilitation plan and continue with the exercises without overexerting
        yourself.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The services offered at this private facility were so expensive that not
        many could afford it. It was barely nearing noon time, but the number of
        people in the building had already dwindled significantly. The check-up
        was completed quickly. As the doctor was prescribing some medications
        and arranging the schedule for his next appointment, he suddenly heard
        Jiang Ting ask offhandedly, “Did anyone come by to visit me after I was
        discharged?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There was one,” the doctor replied. His memory of the incident was
        jogged by Jiang Ting’s question. “One of your relatives was here on a
        business trip so he dropped by with the intention to visit you, but
        coincidentally, you had already been discharged a day prior. He even
        asked for your girlfriend’s contact details.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Seemingly surprised by the appearance of this relative, Jiang Ting
        paused for a few moments, then asked, “Relative? What’s his name?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The thought that this relative of Jiang Ting’s was so distant that he
        did not appear for the past three years probably crossed the doctor’s
        mind, so he merely smiled and replied, “He was a man in his forties and
        looked quite buff. You can head over to the front desk to get his name
        from the nurse later on. He said he was a distant cousin of yours. Do
        you have any recollection of this person?”
      </p>

      <p>“Was he around 1.8m in height, wearing a baseball cap?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, that’s him! Is he really your cousin?”</p>

      <p>
        As Jiang Ting recalled the gaze he met in the breakfast cafe earlier on,
        heaviness descended between his brows but he neither acknowledged or
        denied the doctor’s question. Instead, he asked, “Did the nurse give
        Yang Mei’s number to him?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor replied, “That’s impossible. Who knew who he really was? The
        nurse asked if he wanted to leave his contact details behind but he
        didn’t wish to. He left shortly after.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting got down from the examination bed and bent over to tie his
        shoelaces. He insouciantly did up his buttons one by one and
        straightened his attire.
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor finished signing the necessary documents and looked up.
        Unexpectedly, the sight that greeted him left him a little dazed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gentle rays of sunlight streamed in through the window, enveloping
        Jiang Ting in a soft glow. His jet black hair cut a sharp contrast with
        his snow-white cheeks, and the sharp line of his back tapered into a
        narrow waist and a pair of long, slender legs—the very image of a taut
        bowstring.
      </p>

      <p>
        To think that the frail patient from bed 538, whom they all assumed was
        a poor country bumpkin who mooched off a woman, would turn into a
        completely different man. His mannerisms and bearing had changed so much
        that he bore no resemblance to the rumours that circulated during his
        hospitalization.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The next time someone comes looking for me,” said Jiang Ting, “you can
        ignore them. No need to ask for their identity.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor could not curb his intense desire to find out more and
        ventured an ask. “That…really was your cousin?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No.” Jiang Ting buttoned up his cuffs and indifferently said, “He’s a
        creditor.”
      </p>

      <p>“…”</p>

      <p>
        With his check-up completed, Jiang Ting bade farewell to the doctor who
        still sported a weird look on his face and left the room with his
        examination report in his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of the patients admitted into this sanatorium fell into two
        categories: they were either on their last breath, entirely dependent on
        machines to prolong their life in a vegetative state, or they were
        elderly patients with long-term ailments that hindered their movement
        and passed their days being wheeled along the sanatorium’s corridors by
        their caretakers. Jiang Ting waited patiently by the elevator, giving
        way to several elderly patients in their wheelchairs, only to see the
        elevator doors close right in his face. Unwilling to wait a moment
        longer, he turned towards the stairs in the middle of the corridor and
        made his way down to the lobby on the first floor, one hand on the
        handrail for support.
      </p>

      <p>
        The building was bustling with activity. Nurses rushed about in the
        lobby, weaving their way through the throng of family members busy with
        admission and discharge procedures. Jiang Ting turned the corner and was
        about to make his descent down the last flight of stairs when he came to
        a sudden stop.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the other end of the lobby, near the entrance to the sanatorium,
        there was a large glass display filled with awards.
      </p>

      <p>
        A hulking figure wearing a black baseball hat stood with his back
        towards Jiang Ting, his stare affixed on the glass of the display case.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the reflection of the glass, Jiang Ting’s figure from afar could be
        seen. His abrupt halt as well as the small step backwards he took
        immediately after were all reflected on the glass.
      </p>

      <p>
        The man turned—it was indeed the same man Jiang Ting saw from the
        breakfast cafe earlier on.
      </p>

      <p>
        As their gazes collided across the sea of people separating them, they
        both seemed to arrive at the same realization. The next moment, Jiang
        Ting lurched into movement, sprinting up the stairs in the same second
        that the man lifted his feet to give chase immediately!
      </p>

      <p>Meanwhile, in an office located on the top floor of the sanatorium.</p>

      <p>
        Beyond the tightly shut doors, two men sat in the office suite. Apart
        from the light rustling as the pages of the medical records were turned,
        the only other sound that could be heard was the breathing of the
        individuals in the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        “…” The sanatorium director craned his neck imperceptibly. His eyes
        darted between the police ID lying face-up on the coffee table and the
        man currently seated opposite him, who claimed to be the Vice-Captain of
        the City Bureau’s Criminal Investigation Unit. “More like a handsome
        young master from a rich family, a prodigal son with nothing better to
        do than to loaf around,” he faintly muttered in his heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        To think that being a policeman these days was such a lucrative job. Did
        the organization really let this dressing style of his slide?
      </p>

      <p>
        Or was he being pranked and this visitor of his wasn’t a criminal
        investigator, but an actor from a little-known TV station filming a
        reality series?
      </p>

      <p>Yan Xie cleared his throat loudly.</p>

      <p>
        The director immediately sat at attention, pasting a cordial smile on
        his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pointing a finger at the medical records, Yan Xie asked, “It’s written
        here that the cause of the patient’s head injury was due to severe
        impact. Why was this impact determined to be from a car accident and not
        an explosion?”
      </p>

      <p>
        With a condescending smile, the director replied, “This question of
        yours, are you saying that a car accident is the same as an explosion?
        Us doctors will never make such an amateur mistake.”
      </p>

      <p>“Then how do you explain the burn injuries?”</p>

      <p>
        “Well…” The director took a moment to mull it over, then said, “Back
        then, Mr. Lu was transferred to this sanatorium by his girlfriend. When
        he arrived, he was already unconscious and unresponsive, one step away
        from falling into a vegetative state in all senses of the term. Although
        we undertook the treatment of Mr. Lu, his condition was dire. Other than
        the severe head injury caused by the accident, he suffered from other
        injuries as well. In comparison, the burn injuries on his limbs had
        already been through meticulous treatment and were recovering well by
        the time he was transferred here.”
      </p>

      <p>“Other injuries?” Yan Xie asked.</p>

      <p>
        “There were quite a number of them. Infected wounds, malnutrition,
        malalignment of his previously dislocated left elbow, ulceration across
        his right wrist as well as tendon and nerve damage, abrasions all over
        his body. These injuries were all obtained before his car accident. It
        took half a year’s worth of treatment before his condition took a turn
        for the better.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie fell into deep thought, an impassive expression on his face.
        Suddenly, he commented, “The tendon and nerve injuries in his wrist were
        probably caused by deep cuts.”
      </p>

      <p>“Yes, you can say so. But, in Mr. Lu’s case…”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>
        The director paused, unsure of whether to continue, but he eventually
        said, “His injuries seem to be caused by human teeth.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The hand that Yan Xie used to hold the medical record trembled slightly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The director sighed and flashed a rueful smile. “We speculated that this
        patient must have been escaping from a multilevel marketing scheme at
        that point in time and was thus speeding on the road. Otherwise, how
        could his injuries have been so severe?”
      </p>

      <p>“Why didn’t you make a police report?”</p>

      <p>
        The director scoffed. “What are you saying? We are a private sanatorium,
        advocating the highest level of protection for our patients’ privacy.
        Respecting the wishes of family members is a moral we live by. We’re
        going down the high-end market route.” The director rubbed his hands
        together and chuckled in a low tone, “It’s not that we’re deliberately
        refusing to take the initiative in cooperating with the police. Back
        then, Miss Yang refused to budge no matter what, saying that she did not
        wish to make a police report or let anyone find out about this, hence
        the transfer to our facility. The competition in the private nursing
        care field is fierce and we have our reputation to consider as well—”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yang Mei and this Jiang… Lu Chengjiang, what kind of relationship do
        they have?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The kind of relationship between a man and woman. To be honest, we all
        thought it was true love. Miss Yang has such good qualities and she is
        someone who rises to the occasion. Usually, we don’t allow our staff to
        gossip about our customers’ private matters, but after Mr. Lu woke up
        from his coma, the situation seemed a little strange.”
      </p>

      <p>Yan Xie quirked a brow. “Strange?”</p>

      <p>
        The director hesitated for a few seconds before laughing lightly. “It
        seemed like…Miss Yang is the clingier one in their relationship.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie did not respond and merely let out a barely audible snort of
        amusement through his nose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yang Mei clearly did not “rise up to the occasion” out of altruistic
        intentions. She might not be a criminal, but she certainly played in the
        gray area. Her two cases in Gongzhou and Jianning were most probably
        settled by Jiang Ting. Before Jiang Ting’s demise in the explosion due
        to his own misjudgement, he was a strong contender in the fight to
        become the next Captain of Gongzhou City’s Narcotics Unit, in terms of
        his qualifications and achievements.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Yang Mei to be able to hug on tight to Jiang Ting’s thigh then could
        already be considered a miracle.
      </p>

      <p>
        The director was unable to fathom Yan Xie’s reaction and he casted a
        calculated glance in Yan Xie’s direction. “That… Captain Yan, do you
        have other questions? We will provide our utmost cooperation, we won’t
        hide anything we know and if we know something, we will definitely
        inform you…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie waved his sincerity away. Returning the medical records to the
        director, he stood up.
      </p>

      <p>
        The director was about to follow suit and already had a couple of
        pleasantries prepared at the tip of his tongue when he heard Yan Xie
        say, “One last question.”
      </p>

      <p>“Please, go ahead.”</p>

      <p>
        Unexpectedly, Yan Xie’s next question shocked the director speechless.
        In a deliberately measured tone, he asked, “When Mr Lu was transferred
        here, a blood test was conducted. Did the test results come out positive
        for any drugs?”
