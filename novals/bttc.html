        Yan Xie got out of the police car and slowly crossed his arms as he eyed
        the shop sign before his eyes.

        Ma Xiang went up to greet him, “Yan-ge, the one who reported the case is

      <p>
        On the <span class="word" title="人行道">sidewalk</span> outside the
        store, a police officer was recording a statement from Jiang Ting, who

        him on the shoulder. “Hey, Vice-Captain Yan!”
      </p>
      <p>Yan Xie gestured with his hand and said, “Leave this to me.”</p>
      <p>
        The officer let out a surprised “oh” and handed over the statement

        others.

        However, Yan Xie showed no interest towards the records he held in his

      <p>“Hello, Officer Yan,” Jiang Ting greeted politely.</p>

        with leads this early. What a shame.”

        The next few seconds passed in silence, their gazes locked onto each
        other. It was Yan Xie who broke the silence first.

        “Feng Yuguang was a post-graduate student from a
        <span class="word" title="著名的;闻名的;有名的;受尊敬的">renowned</span>

        Jiang Ting let out a low

      </p>
      <p>
        “So, do you have any

      </p>
      <p>
        Jiang Ting looked at Yan Xie questioningly, a look of perfectly

        “None. This question of yours seems a little…”
      </p>
      <p>“Then what’s with the ‘I see’?”</p>
      <p>“…”</p>
      <p>
        Yan Xie remarked coldly, “I only mentioned addictive drugs, yet you

        It was already five A.M. in the morning, and the sky was beginning to
        lighten up. Deciding to abandon the idea of sleeping, Yan Xie opened Hu
        Weisheng’s case file to
        <span title="/ pəˈruːz / 详细考察；精读" class="word">peruse</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hu Weisheng was a textbook example of the saying, ‘a child who steals a
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈniːd(ə)l / 缝衣针；编织针；注射针; 针"

        theft. After he came of age, he moved on to stealing purses, mobile
        phones and electric bicycles, and was
        <span class="word" title="/ ɪmˈprɪznd / 被封印，被囚禁的"
          >imprisoned</span
        >
        a couple of times as a result. A few years ago, he was involved in a
        more serious case in Gongzhou and was
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ˈsentənst / v. 判决；审判；宣判（sentence 的过去式，过去分词）"

      </p>
      <p>
        Yan Xie ran a hand over the
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈstʌbl / 胡子茬，发茬，须茬">stubbles</span>
        on his chin, then gave a low cry of surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hu Weisheng was a street thief, and his targets were always
        <span class="phrase" title="随身物品">personal belongings</span>. He had
        no records of
        <span class="phrase" title="非法闯入 入室盗窃"
          >breaking and entering</span
        >. Judging from this point alone, he was probably a
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈkaʊərd / 胆小鬼，懦夫">coward</span>, and
        the nature of his crimes was
        <span class="word" title="内在地，固有地">inherently</span> different
        from the rape that he was <span class="word">convicted</span> of. This
        act of his that “<span class="word" title="过界"
          >crossed boundaries</span
        >” was very suspicious indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Staring at the word ‘Gongzhou’ in the case file, something
        <span class="word" title="/ stɜːrd / 搅拌，搅和">stirred</span>
        within the depths of his heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Yan-ge.” Suddenly, Ma Xiang
        <span class="word" title="/ poʊk / 戳，刺；从……露出（或伸出、探出）"
          >poked</span

        his head in. “That top chemistry student has been

        in the bureau for almost 24 hours. Should we release him?”
      </p>
      <p>Yan Xie raised his head in surprise. “What? He’s still here?”</p>
      <p>
        “The forensic team failed to
        <span class="word" title="恢复">recover</span> any footage from the lab,

      </p>
      <p>
        Ma Xiang flashed an ‘OK’ sign at Yan Xie and said, “No problem. The top
        student had already said he won’t file a complaint, we just need to
        hurry up and send him back to the lab.”
      </p>

        Yan Xie gave a wave and gestured at Ma Xiang to make a move and close
        the door behind him.

        Liu Xue, eighteen years old, was a student from a renowned high school
        in Gongzhou.
      </p>
      <p>
        A day before the start of
        <span class="word" title="第二次模拟考试">the second mock exam</span>,
        this third year student took advantage of the
        <span class="phrase" title="午休">noon break</span> to
        <span title="/ sniːk / 偷偷地走，潜行；偷带，私运 ">sneak</span> out of
        the school
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈdɔːrmətɔːri / 集体宿舍">dormitories</span>
        and disappeared for the entire afternoon. That night, the school
        launched a search effort that lasted the entire night but to no
        <span class="word" title="/ əˈveɪl / n. 效用，利益">avail</span>. Her
        parents lodged a police report the following day. In less than a day,
        this missing persons case attracted the full attention of the local
        police station and was soon
        <span class="word" title="转移">transferred</span> over to the district
        bureau.
      </p>
      <p>The district bureau accepted the case.</p>
      <p>
        The following night, based on a series of investigations, the police
        found an
        <span class="word" title="昏迷的，不省人事的；">unconscious</span> Liu
        Xue in an unlicensed
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈklɪnɪk / 诊所，门诊部">clinic</span>.

      <p>
        According to the

          >subsequent</span

        investigation, the suspect Hu Weisheng chanced upon Liu Xue when the
        latter was

        and he immediately
        <span class="word" title="/ lʊr / 引诱，诱惑">lured</span> her into the
        car and drugged her. Unexpectedly, Liu Xue was

        to the drug he
        <span class="word" title="/ ədˈmɪnɪstəd / 注射 执行">administered</span>
        and she immediately developed a series of symptoms such as
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈdɪzinəs / 头晕；头昏眼花 ">dizziness</span>
        and
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈvɑːmɪtɪŋ / 呕吐（vomit 的 ing 形式）"
          >vomiting</span
        >. She eventually

          >fainted</span
        >. Hu Weisheng was afraid that he would be

        <span class="word" title="/ ˌæksəˈdent(ə)l / 意外的，偶然的"

        <span class="word" title="/ ˈbrɪskli / 迅速地；活泼地；尖刻地"
          >briskly</span
        >
        left her at an unlicensed clinic and left.
      </p>
      <p>
        The nature of this case was ruled as attempted rape. After Liu Xue was
        <span title="撤销 出院">discharged</span> from the
        <span class="phrase" title="医院治疗">hospital post-treatment</span>, Hu
        Weisheng was sentenced to three years imprisonment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Staring at the case file, Yan Xie could not believe his eyes—it was
        simply ruled as such?
      </p>
      <p>
        What was the real cause of the victim’s allergic reaction? What was the
        drug administered? Were there no other reasons for a man to drug a woman
        other than rape? If he really
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ˈhɑːrbər / 庇护；窝藏；怀有；为……提供庇护；入港停泊；居住，生存"
          >harbored</span
        >
        the intention to rape her, then why did the
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈreɪpɪst / 强奸犯">rapist</span>
        <span class="word" title="恐慌">panic</span> after she lost
        consciousness and send her straight to a clinic?
      </p>
      <p>
        It had only been less than a month since the case was
        <span class="word" title="/ faɪld / 申请；存档（file 的过去分词形式）"
          >filed</span

          >referred</span
        >
        to the district bureau. There was obviously more to the case than meets
        the eye but the case was inexplicably resolved with such
        <span class="word" title="/ heɪst / 仓促，急忙">haste</span>. Did none
        of the investigators involved in this case raise their suspicions
        regarding this unusual matter?

        <span class="word" title="/ ɜːrdʒ / 催促">urge</span> and scrolled to

      <p>The lead investigator of this case then was called Jiang Ting.</p>
      <p>
        From the depths of his memories, a large shadow surfaced. In that split
        second, the

        This was the only time the

        building did not have many customers at this time. Jiang Ting chose a
        corner seat in the cafe. Keeping a careful eye on his watch, he split a
        pair of

      <p>
        As he sent off his reply, he suddenly caught sight of something out of
        the corner of his eye and looked up.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the other end of the cafe, not far from him, a gaze was unable to be
        withdrawn in time and in that split second, their eyes locked.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a man in his forties,
        <span class="word" title="/ dɑːn / v. 穿上，披上，戴上">donned</span> in
        a white
        <span class="word" title="/ sliːvd / 短袖的">short-sleeved</span>
        t-shirt and a baseball cap. He had a tall and
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈbɜːrli / 结实的；率直的；粗鲁的"
          >burly</span
        >
        figure, with muscles rippling across his shoulders. The
        <span class="word" title="/ brɪm / 帽檐，帽边；">brim</span> of his cap
        was pulled low, making it hard to
        <span

          >discern</span
        >
        any features from a distance. Their gazes only crossed for a brief
        moment before the man lowered his head to continue his meal,
        nonchalantly flipping a page of his newspaper, as though everything that
        happened earlier was just a coincidence and nothing was out of the
        ordinary.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting’s eyes
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ˈflɪkər / 闪烁，摇曳；闪现 眼睛）瞟过；颤动 "

          >roved</span

        over the rest of the dining area, his expression unchanging.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few minutes later, putting aside his half-eaten porridge and barely
        touched side dishes, he got up to pay and left.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your body’s

      </p>

      <p>
        Within the examination room, Jiang Ting lay
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈsuːpaɪn / 仰卧的；懒散的">supine</span> on

      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor nodded. “That’s normal. Let’s

      </p>

      <p>
        The services offered at this private
        <span class="word" title="/ fəˈsɪləti / 设施，设备；">facility</span>
        were so expensive that not many could afford it. It was barely nearing
        noon time, but the number of people in the building had already
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ˈdwɪnd(ə)l / （逐渐）减少，变小；使缩小，使减少"
          >dwindled</span

        significantly. The check-up was completed quickly. As the doctor was
        <span class="word" title="/ prɪˈskraɪbɪŋ / 规定；开药"
          >prescribing</span
        >
        some medications and arranging the schedule for his next appointment, he
        suddenly heard Jiang Ting ask
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ˌɔːfˈhændɪdli / 即席地；立即地；不客气地 随便地"
          >offhandedly</span
        >, “Did anyone come by to visit me after I was discharged?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There was one,” the doctor replied. His memory of the
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈɪnsɪdənt / 事件，事故；">incident</span>
        was
        <span
          class="word"

          >jogged</span

        by Jiang Ting’s question. “One of your
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈrelətɪvz / 亲属；关系词（relative 的复数）"
          >relatives</span
        >
        was here on a business trip so he dropped by with the intention to visit
        you, but coincidentally, you had already been discharged a day prior. He
        even asked for your girlfriend’s contact details.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Seemingly surprised by the appearance of this relative, Jiang Ting
        paused for a few moments, then asked, “Relative? What’s his name?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The thought that this relative of Jiang Ting’s was so distant that he
        did not appear for the past three years probably
        <span class="word" title="probably">crossed</span> the doctor’s mind, so
        he merely smiled and replied, “He was a man in his forties and looked
        quite
        <span class="word" title="/ bʌf / 身体强健的，肌肉发达的；浅黄褐色的"
          >buff</span

      </p>

      <p>“Was he around 1.8m in height, wearing a baseball cap?”</p>

      <p>“Yes, that’s him! Is he really your cousin?”</p>

      <p>
        As Jiang Ting recalled the gaze he met in the breakfast cafe earlier on,
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈhevinəs / n. 沉重；沉闷；笨拙；迟钝；忧伤"
          >heaviness</span

        between his brows but he neither acknowledged or denied the doctor’s
        question. Instead, he asked, “Did the nurse give Yang Mei’s number to
        him?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor replied, “That’s impossible. Who knew who he really was? The
        nurse asked if he wanted to leave his contact details
        <span class="word" title="/ bɪˈhaɪnd  / 在……后面">behind</span> but he
        didn’t wish to. He left shortly after.”
      </p>

        Jiang Ting got down from the examination bed and

        Jiang Ting waited patiently by the elevator, giving way to several
        elderly patients in their wheelchairs, only to see the elevator doors
        close right in his face. Unwilling to wait a moment longer, he turned
        towards the stairs in the middle of the corridor and made his way down
        to the lobby on the first floor, one hand on the

      <p>
        At the other end of the lobby, near the entrance to the sanatorium,
        there was a large glass display filled with awards.

      <p>
        The man turned—it was indeed the same man Jiang Ting saw from the
        breakfast cafe earlier on.
      </p>

      <p>
        As their gazes

        the stairs in the same second that the man lifted his feet to give chase

      <p>Meanwhile, in an office located on the top floor of the sanatorium.</p>

      <p>
        Beyond the

      </p>

      <p>Yan Xie cleared his throat loudly.</p>

      <p>
        The director immediately sat at attention,
        <span
          class="word"

        >
        smile on his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pointing a finger at the medical records, Yan Xie asked, “It’s written
        here that the cause of the patient’s head injury was due to severe
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈɪmpækt / 撞击，冲击力；巨大影响，强大作用"

        smile, the director replied, “This question of yours, are you saying
        that a car accident is the same as an explosion? Us doctors will never

      </p>

      <p>“Then how do you explain the burn injuries?”</p>

      <p>
        “Well…” The director took a moment to mull it over, then said, “Back
        then, Mr. Lu was transferred to this sanatorium by his girlfriend. When
        he arrived, he was already unconscious and unresponsive, one step away

      <p>“Other injuries?” Yan Xie asked.</p>

        took a turn for the better.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie fell into deep thought, an impassive expression on his face.
        Suddenly, he commented, “The tendon and nerve injuries in his wrist were
        probably caused by
        <span class="phrase" title="深度割伤">deep cuts</span>.”
      </p>

      <p>“Yes, you can say so. But, in Mr. Lu’s case…”</p>

      <p>“What?”</p>

      <p>
        The director paused, unsure of whether to continue, but he eventually
        said, “His injuries seem to be caused by human teeth.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The hand that Yan Xie used to hold the medical record
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈtrembld / 震颤">trembled</span> slightly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The director <span class="word" title="/ saɪd / 叹息">sighed</span> and
        flashed a
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈruːf(ə)l / 可怜的；悲伤的；悔恨的"

        smile. “We speculated that this patient must have been escaping from a

        at that point in time and was thus speeding on the road. Otherwise, how
        could his injuries have been so severe?”
      </p>

      <p>“Why didn’t you make a police report?”</p>

      <p>
        The director scoffed. “What are you saying? We are a private sanatorium,

        they have?”

      <p>
        “The kind of relationship between a man and woman. To be honest, we all
        thought it was true love. Miss Yang has such good qualities and she is

      <p>
        Yang Mei clearly did not “rise up to the occasion” out of

        She might not be a criminal, but she certainly played in the gray area.
        Her two cases in Gongzhou and Jianning were most probably settled by
        Jiang Ting. Before Jiang Ting’s
        <span class="word" title="/ dɪˈmaɪz / 死亡，逝世">demise</span> in the
        explosion due to his own misjudgement, he was a strong

        >
        and achievements.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Yang Mei to be able to hug on tight to Jiang Ting’s
        <span class="word" title="/ θaɪ / 大腿，股；（禽类的）腿">thigh</span>
        then could already be considered a
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈmɪrək(ə)l / 奇迹">miracle</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The director was unable to
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈfæðəm / ">fathom</span> Yan Xie’s reaction
        and he casted a

          >calculated</span

        glance in Yan Xie’s direction. “That… Captain Yan, do you have other
        questions? We will provide our utmost cooperation, we won’t hide
        anything we know and if we know something, we will definitely inform
        you…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie waved his
        <span class="word" title="/ sɪnˈserəti / 真诚，真挚">sincerity</span>
        away. Returning the medical records to the director, he stood up.
      </p>

      <p>
        The director was about to follow suit and already had a couple of
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈplezntri / 幽默；开玩笑"
          >pleasantries</span
        >
        prepared at the tip of his tongue when he heard Yan Xie say, “One last
        question.”
      </p>

      <p>“Please, go ahead.”</p>

      <p>
        Unexpectedly, Yan Xie’s next question shocked the director speechless.
        In a deliberately

        conducted. Did the test results come out positive for any drugs?”

      <p>
        Yang Mei stood by the car door as
        <span class="word" title="无数的，数不尽的">countless</span> cars rushed
        past her on the busy road.
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈnɪtɪŋ / 编织；皱眉（knit 的 ing 形式）"
          >Knitting</span
        >
        her eyebrows together, she dialed the number again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as the dial tone was about to end to be replaced by the same
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈɔːtəmeɪtɪd / 自动化的">automated</span>
        voicemail, the other side picked up. “Hello?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang-ge, are you done with things on your side? I just completed my
        errands, I’ll pick you up right now—”
      </p>

      <p>“I’m being followed.”</p>

      <p>
        “What?!” Stunned, Yang Mei instantly lowered her volume and whispered
        into her phone, “By whom? Are they from Gongzhou, or…?”
      </p>

      <p>
        When there was no immediate response, an icy chill arose from Yang Mei’s
        heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        If it was an agent from Gongzhou, the most they would want would be
        Jiang Ting’s life.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, if they were sent by them, then it could lead to the worst case
        <span class="word" title="/ səˈnærioʊ / 设想，可能发生的情况 场景"

          >one terrifying beyond imagination</span
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I can’t say for now.” Jiang Ting’s voice finally sounded from the
        <span class="word" title="听筒 接收器，接收机">receiver</span>. Yang Mei
        faintly sensed that he was taking large strides on his end. “This person
        came to the hospital to
        <span class="word" title="/ ɪnˈkwaɪər / 调查，查究；询问，打听"
          >inquire</span

      </p>

      <p>
        “Then what should we do now?! I will head over to pick you up
        immediately!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Regardless of who’s trying to kill me, your existence is still a
        mystery to them. Don’t look for me. Go back to the bar to get help. I’ll
        lure him out of the sanatorium first. Call you later.” Jiang Ting’s cool
        tone was like a
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ˈsuːðɪŋ / 安慰的，使人平静的；舒缓的，镇痛的"

        her anxiety.
      </p>

      <p>“Hello? Jiang-ge!…”</p>

      <p>
        The busy tone from the other end was the only answer; Jiang Ting had
        already <span class="word" title="挂断电话">hung up</span> on her.
      </p>

        <span

        the phone back into his pocket, Jiang Ting raised his eyes. At the end
        of the corridor was a glass door. From the reflection, Jiang Ting could
        see his
        <span class="word" title="/ pərˈsuːər / 追求者；追捕者；研究者；原告"
          >pursuer</span
        >’s shadow around the corner.
      </p>

      <p><em>So close.</em></p>

      <p>
        Was this the work of an
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈæmətər / 非专业的，业余爱好的；不熟练的"
          >amateur</span
        >
        or was he planning to <span title="打算动手">make a move</span>?
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting was already nearing the end of the corridor, faced with a
        dead end in front of him. After a quick look around, he immediately
        rushed down the stairs towards the lower floors. His footsteps were so
        swift that when he made a turn, the wind in his wake
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ˈdʒentli / 文静地，温柔地；轻柔地；渐进地，平缓地；注意点，慢点"

        <span class="word" title="/ ˈlɪftɪd / 举起（lift 的过去分词）；抬升"
          >lifted</span
        >
        the ends of a nurse’s hair. With a
        <span class="word" title="专心的；纯真的；真诚的；率直的"
          >single-minded</span
        >
        focus, Jiang Ting made no inclination to slow down as he
        <span class="word" title="继续">proceeded</span> on to the next floor.
      </p>

      <p>He arrived at the fourth floor.</p>

      <p>
        This was the end of the stairwell. Only the fire escape and the
        elevators led to the lower floors from here.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the split second after the tip of his shoe brushed against the bottom
        step of the
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈsterkeɪs / 楼梯">staircase</span>, his eyes
        had already swept the
        <span class="word" title="/ səˈraʊndɪŋz / 周围环境，周围事物"
          >surroundings</span
        >. The
        <span class="word" title="/ wɔːrd / 病房，病室">ward</span> rooms,
        elevator, nurses’ station, fire exit—with an unchanging expression,
        Jiang Ting carefully took note of these details and mapped a layout of
        the floor plan in his mind. About twenty metres away from him, several
        nurses were pushing their respective elderly patients
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈliːʒərli / 从容地，闲适地">leisurely</span>
        down the corridor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Above him, the
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈθʌndərɪŋ / 如雷鸣的；非常的；异乎寻常的"
          >thundering</span
        >
        footsteps slowed; it appeared that the pursuer was taking in the
        situation too.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, the elevator
        <span class="word" title="/chimed/ 鸣；打；和协（chime 的过去分词）"
          >chimed</span
        >
        and the doors slid open.
      </p>

      <p>
        A nurse exited from the elevator, pushing a small
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ kɑːrt / 马拉的）大车，马车；小型机动车；购物车，手推车"
          >cart</span
        >
        in front of her. She turned towards a side corridor that branched off
        from the end of the main corridor, on her way to refill hot water for
        the patients before their meals arrived.
      </p>

      <p>
        From an outsider’s point of view, Jiang Ting’s movements were smooth and
        devoid of
        <span class="word" title="/ ˌhezɪˈteɪʃ(ə)n / 犹豫，不情愿"
          >hesitation</span
        >, as though he had a clear plan in his mind that he acted in
        <span class="word" title="/ əˈkɔːrdns / 与……一致（in accordance with）"
          >accordance</span
        >
        to, naturally

          title="/ ˈstraɪdɪŋ / 跨步（stride 的现在分词）；大步行走"
          >striding</span
        >
        in the same direction that the nurse was headed.
      </p>

      <p>The man in the baseball cap followed closely on his heels.</p>

      <p>
        It could be seen that this sanatorium paid particular attention to its
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ɪnˈtɪriər / 内部的，里面的；国内的，内政的；"
          >interior</span
        >
        design. Every corner of the connecting hallways sported a large potted
        plant. Rounding a corner and making his way past a
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ˈvɜːrd(ə)nt / 青翠的；翠绿的；没有经验的；不老练的"

        plant, Jiang Ting found what he was looking for. A lunch cart
        <span class="word" title="/ sæt / 坐（sit 的过去式和过去分词）"
          >sat</span
        >
        outside the entrance to the first room of the ward.

        >
        lines on top of the cart. The nurse had already entered the sickroom,
        leaving the door
        <span class="word" title="/ əˈdʒɑːr / 半开的；微开的；不和谐的"
          >ajar</span

        stuck out a hand and grabbed a bowl of soup,
        <span class="word" title="/ ʌpˈend / 颠倒，倒置">upending</span> it
        behind him before replacing the empty bowl back on the cart, all in one
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈfluːɪd / 液体的，流体的">fluid</span>
        movement, without so much as a second glance or a break in his step as
        he continued his way forward.
      </p>

        The other side was silent for a moment, before a woman’s voice came

        the corridor, but he was certain that he had already lost sight of his
        target’s shadow. At this moment, however, a nearby elevator chimed.
        Turning around, he spotted Jiang Ting’s figure entering the
        <span class="word" title="/ lɪft / 电梯，升降机；">lift</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other side of the phone, the woman coldly ordered, “Get rid of
        him. I’ll send someone to pick you up.”
      </p>

        Without a moment’s hesitation, the man

      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting pressed the button to close the elevator doors, then pressed
        the button to the topmost floor of the building. He
        <span class="word" title="/ treɪnd / 训练（train 的过去分词） "

        baseball cap in the distance, his face devoid of expression. The doors
        slowly slid to a close moments before the man caught up.
      </p>

      <p>However, immediately after, the elevator started its descent!</p>

      <p title="江停轻轻“嘶”了一声。">
        Jiang Ting

        softly under his breath.
      </p>

      <p>
        When choosing elevators as an escape route, it was best to head upwards
        instead of down.
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ˈhɜːrtl / 急飞，猛烈碰撞，猛掷（hurtle 的 ing 形式）"
          >Hurtling</span
        >
        down three flights of stairs required significantly less effort and time
        than sprinting up. Furthermore, the double doors of hospital elevators
        took a longer time to open and close as compared to other elevators.
      </p>

      <p>
        Keeping these calculations in mind, even if it was a smooth
        <span class="word" title="/ raɪd / 行程">ride</span> to the first floor,
        Jiang Ting would only be ahead of the man in the baseball cap by three
        to four seconds at best.
      </p>

      <p><em>Ding</em>!</p>

      <p>
        The elevator doors slid open once more. Before the people waiting to
        enter made their way in, Jiang Ting had already
        <span class="word" title="/ skwiːzd / 挤压">squeezed</span> his way out,
        rushing towards the entrance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Nonetheless, his

        came true. A few seconds after he stepped out, the emergency exit door
        in the corner of the lobby
        <span class="word" title="/ swʌŋ / 摇摆（swing 的过去式和过去分词）"
          >swung</span

        open and the man in the baseball cap charged out from within. It only
        took a few seconds of searching before he located Jiang Ting’s location
        in the crowd. He

      <p>
        A few elderly aunts in the queue exclaimed angrily, “What do you think
        you’re doing? Stop pushing!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting ignored their cries of anger as he pressed on without pause,
        his call to Yang Mei ringing.
      </p>

      <p>“Another queue cutter!”</p>

      <p>Behind him, the elderly aunts raised their voices again.</p>

      <p>“Why is a young man like you pushing people around?’</p>

      <p>
        “Are you rushing to be

      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting turned around. The man in the baseball cap was also in the
        midst of

        that the call had finally connected. Yang Mei asked anxiously,
        “Jiang-ge?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Have you reached—” With his head still turned, Jiang Ting spoke into
        his phone. Unexpectedly, he

          >stinging</span
        >
        pain when he heard a familiar male voice say, with a hint of laughter
        and surprise in his voice, “How coincidental. If it isn’t Mr. Lu?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting looked up. Yan Xie stood before him with his arms crossed,
        amusement dancing in his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang-ge? Hello?” Yang Mei’s panicked voice drifted out from the phone.
        “Jiang-ge?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The man in the baseball cap was only five metres away from them. His
        right hand was stuffed into his pocket and his muscles were visibly
        tense under his t-shirt. His hulking figure
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ luːm / v. 尤指阴森森地）隐约出现，赫然耸现；逼近，临近"
          >loomed</span
        >
        behind the crowd. Beneath the brim of his baseball cap drawn low, he
        stared fixedly on Jiang Ting, like a
        <span class="word" title="/ haɪˈiːnə / [脊椎] 鬣狗，土狼">hyena</span>

        Yang Mei’s voice was

          class="word"
          title="/ ʃrɪl / adj. 尖锐的；刺耳的 v. 尖声喊叫 n. 尖叫声"

        >. “Jiang-ge! Answer me! Are you safe?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh, you’re on the phone.” The corners of Yan Xie’s lips curved
        <span class="word" title="/ ˈʌpwərdz / adv. 向上；在上部；向上游"
          >upwards</span
        >
        as he said, “That’s fine, continue with whatever you’re busy with. I’ll
        see you around.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As the words left his lips, he prepared to take the next step that would
        bring him past Jiang Ting, shoulders brushing as he headed towards the
        elevator.
      </p>

      <p>In the next millionth of a second, Jiang Ting made his decision.</p>

      <p>
        “I’m fine, I
        <span class="word" title="/ bʌmpt / 被碰撞的 凸起的；凸状的"
          >bumped</span
        >
        into Vice-Captain Yan at the hospital. I’ll call you back later.” Jiang
        Ting ended the call as he turned around and stretched out a hand. Under
        the <span class="word" title="/ duˈres / 强迫；监禁">duress</span> of
        his anxiety, he grabbed Yan Xie’s arm directly.
      </p>

      <p>“Vice-Captain Yan…”</p>

      <p>Yan Xie glanced at Jiang Ting.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting wasn’t sure if it was just his
        <span class="word" title="/ ˌmɪskənˈsepʃ(ə)n / 错误想法，误解，错误印象"
          >misconception</span

          >roguish</span
        >
        man—one who looked more like a rich, young police officer than the
        Vice-Captain of a unit—trained his gaze on Jiang Ting, he saw a
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ feɪnt / adj. 模糊的，微弱的；微小的，可能性不大的；虚弱的，头晕目眩的；不热情的"
          >faint</span
        >, indescribable light flicker in the depths of the man’s eyes, bright
        enough to strike fear. Jiang Ting felt his heart tremble.
      </p>

      <p>“What’s up?” Yan Xie asked.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting let out a soft exhale, as though he was slowly
        <span class="word" title="/ ɪkˈspelɪŋ / 驱逐（expel 的 ing 形式）"
          >expelling</span
        >
        all the emotions that had gathered in his chest. Curving his lips, he
        flashed Yan Xie a smile. “Why is Vice-Captain Yan here?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “A relative of mine is hospitalised here. I happened to be free today,
        so I dropped by to visit. What about you?’ Yan Xie replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the smile on his face, Jiang Ting said, “It’s been a few days since
        I was discharged. I’m here for a check-up.”
      </p>

      <p>“There shouldn’t be any problems then?”</p>

      <p>“Everything went well.”</p>

      <p>
        At this point in their conversation, Jiang Ting faltered. Before he had
        the chance to say anything else, Yan Xie had already lifted his wrist to
        glance at the time in a deliberate manner. “It’s good that things are
        fine. I don’t want to
        <span
          class="word"

          >head off</span
        >
        first.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment Yan Xie moved to
        <span class="word" title="/ rɪˈtrækt / 缩回；缩进；取消">retract</span>
        his arm, however, Jiang Ting swung his entire body around to face him,
        just as Yan Xie expected.
      </p>

      <p>“Vice-Captain Yan—”</p>

      <p>“Yes?”</p>

      <p>
        Standing at a height of 1.87m, Yan Xie towered over the rest of the

        “Hey—” Jiang Ting quickly moved to stop him. “Yang Mei isn’t here

          >attempts</span

        sensing that they sounded a little odd.

      <p>
        It was noon. The golden sun of early May hung high up in the sky, its

        Jiang Ting’s phone vibrated soundlessly in his pocket, but he ended the

        much heat in my body as compared to you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie stared meaningfully at Jiang Ting’s tightly buttoned cuffs and
        gave a light laugh. “What are you saying? Your condition isn’t as
        serious as being half-crippled. Mr. Lu looks so much younger than I am.”
      </p>

      <p>
        For lack of a better response, Jiang Ting muttered

        <em>There must be something wrong with this person’s brain.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie asked, “Are you thinking that I’ve either gone mad from handling
        the case, or that there’s something wrong with my brain?”
      </p>

      <p>“…How could I think of Vice-Captain Yan in that way?”</p>

      <p>
        Suddenly, Yan Xie came to an abrupt stop and spun around, sweeping his
        gaze over the crowd behind him—ten metres away, out of his

        into the midst of the bustling crowd.

        Acting as though he hadn’t noticed anything unusual, Yan Xie gripped
        Jiang Ting’s wrist and said with a smile, “Do you believe in

        At that moment, his fingertips lightly brushed against the skin
        underneath Jiang Ting’s clothes. Yan Xie could feel the

        with. Hence, to be able to sit down with you at the same table and have
        a peaceful meal together as equals is something that I could only dream

        looked as though he was on the verge of saying something, yet in the end
        he chose not to. Instead, he simply smiled and

        They were currently standing at the entrance to a large shopping mall,
        where the flow of human traffic was high. Yan Xie consciously walked a
        couple of steps away from where they were to pick up the call. Ma

        Glancing down from the top of the steps where he stood, Yan Xie watched
        as Jiang Ting stood on the sidewalk, holding on to his phone while

        Building, near the city centre.” Yan Xie flashed a smile at Jiang Ting
        as he spoke into his phone, “I’m investigating a case from a few years
        ago. If there’s nothing urgent, I’ll call you back later.”

      </p>

      <p>“Are you able to do this alone?”</p>

      <p>
        Just then, Jiang Ting’s phone vibrated, and he lowered his head to take
        a look.

      <p>
        Jiang Ting unlocked his phone and tapped on a button to record a voice
        message. Against the backdrop of the noisy street, his voice was

        him when I’m back.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yang Mei had brought a male employee from the KTV with her, and he had
        heard Jiang Ting’s instructions together with her. She typed out a word
        of acknowledgement and sent it back to Jiang Ting, together with a
        <span class="word" title="/pɪn/ ">pin</span>
        of her current location.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a quick glance at the reply, Jiang Ting stuffed the phone back
        into his pocket. The moment he raised his gaze once more, however, he
        froze in shock.
      </p>

      <p>Yan Xie had disappeared.</p>

      <p>
        In just a mere two seconds, Yan Xie’s figure had
        <span

        without a trace.
      </p>

      <p>

      </p>

      <p>Did he realize something wasn’t right?</p>

      <p>
        Was the meeting at the sanatorium a coincidence, or was it planned right
        from the start?
      </p>

      <p>
        As Jiang Ting hurried towards the steps of the commercial building, he
        made a call to Yan Xie’s phone. It only rang twice before his call was
        rejected.
      </p>

      <p>“…”</p>

      <p>
        He tried to dial again, and the same thing happened. Two rings, then the
        call was cut.
      </p>

      <p>
        His pursuer seemed to have noticed something was
        <span class="word" title="/əˈmɪs/ 不对;不正常">amiss</span> as well, and

        of safety differed from ordinary people. He knew that a place like the
        hospital where there was security and surveillance at all times was
        still a relatively safe environment. Contrastingly, in an exposed area
        like the middle of a street in broad daylight, even though he was
        surrounded by people, it wasn’t safe at all.

      </p>

      <p>
        The man with the baseball cap casted another wary glance around. Upon
        noticing that Yan Xie’s figure was nowhere in sight, he finally made a
        decision.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yang Mei, I’ve got a situation here.” As Jiang Ting

        towards the hotel, he said into the phone, “Head towards the destination
        immediately to await the target. Arrange for two people to back me up.
        I’m now passing the main entrance of Yuanhang commercial building…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yang Mei’s voice was a reflection of her current state of mind, like a
        bowstring stretched taut to its breaking point. “Understood, I’m sending
        someone to cover you immediately! Share your location with me!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s too late.” Jiang Ting

          title="前进，有进展，越来越为人们所接受;占优势;逼近"

        now. “He has caught up!”
      </p>

      <p>
        As though a soundless alarm had

        through the air, at the same instant, both Jiang Ting and the man broke
        into a mad run together!

        grabbed Jiang Ting’s phone and directly ended the call that was still in
        progress.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you never seek help from the right person?” the man whispered
        softly. “This characteristic of yours is extremely troubling.”
      </p>

      <h2>Chapter 11</h2>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting immediately retaliated by jabbing his elbow into his
        assailant’s midriff, knocking him half a step back. The man hissed a
        breath of cold air, yet he was like a seasoned fighter accustomed to
        pain. As soon as Jiang Ting turned around, the man lunged at him in a
        flash, pinning him forcefully against the wall, the tips of their noses
        barely half an inch apart.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Their bodies were pressed so tightly together that they could feel the
        heat rolling off the other person’s body in waves, as their muscles
        heated up from this struggle for dominance.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting slightly averted his face, dodging the other man’s soft
        exhalations. “…Officer Yan,” he murmured.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie’s lips curved into a smirk. With the corners of their lips
        almost touching, he asked, “What’s going on? Which family’s lady did you
        sleep with, drawing her husband’s ire this way?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Ting was speechless.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        At this moment, a loud crash came from behind the bushes! The man in the
        baseball cap had leapt over the wall and caught up to them.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting reacted, but he was pushed down quickly and viciously by Yan
        Xie the instant he moved. Both of them faced each other in a deadlock
        for half a second before Jiang Ting helplessly tilted his chin towards
        the bushes. Raising his brows, he mouthed, “Please.”
      </p>

      <p>This was what Yan Xie wanted.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        “Stay here and don’t move.” Yan Xie patted his shoulders, a trace of
        laughter in his tone. He turned around and made his way out of the
        thicket.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>There was a faint rustling—</p>

      <p>
        The bushes shook and susurrated as Yan Xie moved. Upon hearing the
        sound, the man in the baseball cap turned his head, but before he could
        even say, “Who’s there?”, he was kicked ruthlessly in the chest and sent
        flying. With a loud thump, he landed on a half-collapsed
        flowerbed.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        The man’s emotions swung between shock and anger; furious at the ambush,
        he endured the pain from the attack and staggered to his feet, snarling,
        “Where did you come from, brother? Why are you getting in my way?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        In response, Yan Xie charged towards him. With a loud curse, the man
        whipped out his dagger—there was a flash of cold steel as a silver light
        arced towards Yan Xie!
      </p>

      <p>
        Things suddenly looked grave. The man in the baseball cap was clearly
        trained. Several swings of the dagger came close to cutting Yan Xie’s
        face. Fortunately, Yan Xie was quick to dodge them—he had over a
        decade’s worth of experience in beating thieves, robbers, drug dealers
        and even his own colleagues. His superior skills developed over the
        years were not just for show. Yan Xie pulled away slightly, giving
        himself space to strike out with a sweep of his leg, causing his
        opponent to stagger. Seizing this opening, he snatched up a broken brick
        from the ruined flowerbed and slammed it down mercilessly towards the
        man’s head.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        The man in the baseball cap twisted his head to avoid the attack. The
        brick scraped against his scalp and shattered into pieces. With his life
        on the line, the man in the baseball cap gritted his teeth and swung his
        dagger upwards, aiming for Yan Xie’s throat. A loud slap sounded in the
        air—Yan Xie caught hold of the man’s wrist and gripped onto him tightly.
        With a smooth twist of his hand, he disarmed the man and tossed the
        dagger away.
      </p>

      <p>
        The man spat out a few words between his clenched teeth, “Who are you
        working for? Do you know whose business you are interfering with right
        now?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie gave a humble smile and pulled out his handcuffs with a loud
        jangling noise. “This humbled one is from the legendary and honourable
        police force.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Unexpectedly, although the man in the baseball cap appeared stunned, he
        did not reveal any traces of fear. Instead, a vicious expression flitted
        across his features. Yan Xie had the immediate premonition that
        something bad was going to happen, and he was right—in a quick flash of
        movement, the man in the baseball cap reached into his jacket’s inner
        pocket and pulled out a gun!
      </p>

      <p><em>BANG</em>!</p>

      <hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide" />

      <p>The gunshot reverberated in the alley for a long while.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        In the distance, a young man sporting a leather jacket, ankle-high boots
        and large, aviator sunglasses sat in the driver’s seat of a black SUV.
        In a soft voice, he commented, “They’ve started fighting. The target is
        hidden amongst the bushes. What’s our next move?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Only the sound of static could be heard through the Bluetooth earpiece
        for a few seconds, before a man’s voice spoke in an unhurried tone, “Do
        it cleanly.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The young man replied, “I understand, Big Brother.” He then pulled on
        the handbrake.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie dropped his body to the ground and rolled over in the
        millisecond after the shot was fired, then swiftly got back onto his
        feet. His reaction speed was practically god-like. As he raised his
        head, he was greeted by the sight of smoke and dust whirling before him.
        The bullet had burrowed a hole in the ground that was two fingers
        wide.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Without another word, the man in the baseball cap got up and ran.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Yan Xie drew his gun and gave chase immediately, yelling, “Stop
        running or I’ll shoot!”
      </p>

      <p>
        The other man turned a deaf ear to his warning and rushed out of the
        alley, with Yan Xie hot on his heels. This mad pursuit of theirs lasted
        for a few hundred metres. Just as they were about to exit the winding
        alleyway, an SUV abruptly sped out from the intersection of the road
        ahead of them, brushing past the tips of Yan Xie’s toes and forcing him
        to backpedal instantly.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        “Watch where you’re going #@$…” The driver’s loud swearing gradually
        faded into the distance.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Aided by these precious few seconds worth of delay, the man in the
        baseball cap had already disappeared. It was impossible to continue the
        chase.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Yan Xie cursed again. He whipped out his phone and punched in a
        number. “Ma Xiang, there is a suspect who fired at a police officer with
        a gun near 52 Zhongzheng Road, at the southern alley of Sanmao Street.
        Notify the Traffic Security Bureau to assist the Public Security Unit —
        the suspect is 1.85m in height, weighing approximately 90kg, and he’s
        wearing a white undershirt with a black cap. Get them to seal off the
        roads leading to this area and investigate immediately!”
      </p>

      <p>Ma Xiang paled in shock. “Oh shit! I’ll be right there!”</p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie ended the call and returned his gun to its holster behind his
        waist as he slowly made his way back. Jiang Ting was standing under the
        shade of a tree, in the midst of a call. As he caught sight of Yan Xie
        walking towards him, he hung up and stood in place, faintly tilting his
        chin as he stared quietly at Yan Xie.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting was of medium stature but he was used to looking at people
        from a slight, downward angle—regardless of how well he tried to hide or
        disguise his past and appearance, the minute details within his gaze and
        actions were difficult to fake.
      </p>

      <p>
        They stood a few metres apart, their gazes locked on each other. Neither
        uttered a word. A while later, Yan Xie was the first to break the
        silence. “Can you answer one question?”
      </p>

      <p>“Ask away,” Jiang Ting said.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        As the sun hung high up in the sky, the air in the small alley was still
        and undisturbed. In the distance, police sirens wailed, the faint sounds
        growing distinct as the police cars neared.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        “Actually, the person you slept with was his mother, right? Otherwise,
        why else would that poor son of hers come chasing after you so angrily
        with a gun?” Yan Xie deadpanned.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>“………………..”</p>

      <p>
        The police cars screeched to a halt right outside the alley. More than
        ten criminal investigation officers ran towards them.
      </p>

      <p>
        <br />Yan Xie snorted. “What’s with your expression? I was just screwing
        with you.”&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        With that, he pulled out the sunglasses hanging off his shirt collar and
        casually tossed them over to Jiang Ting.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the man in the baseball cap dashed out of the corner of the street,
        he bumped into two girls carrying an umbrella, nearly knocking them
        over. Without sparing them a second glance, he continued running across
        the street, leaving the furious cries of “Are you crazy?” trailing
        behind him.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        The police sirens had been blaring intermittently all this while,
        sometimes near, sometimes far, sometimes seemingly all around him. He
        couldn’t tell which direction was safe anymore. The man in the baseball
        cap bent over and braced his palms against his knees, panting. Multiple
        attempts to call his employer were unsuccessful; he was met with
        repeated prompts that indicated the other party had their phone switched
        off. He was enraged at his current situation. Just as he was at his
        wit’s end, a black SUV suddenly appeared in front of him and pulled
        over. The window was cranked down to reveal a small crack, exposing the
        upper half of a young man’s face, hidden behind a pair of sunglasses.
      </p>

      <p>“Fan Si?”</p>

      <p>
        The man looked upon the youth as though beholding his saviour. “Y-y-yes,
        you’re here to pick—”
      </p>

      <p>The youth interrupted him curtly. “Get in the car.”</p>

      <p>
        “Report! Report! Someone witnessed the suspect running past them outside
        the main entrance of China Construction Bank, at the intersection of
        Zhonghuan road and Mingguang Road. The build and appearance of the man
        seem to match the description of the suspect. Despatch a car immediately
        to that area!”
      </p>

      <p>
        The walkie-talkie buzzed with static for a moment before Ma Xiang
        yelled, “Understood!” He nodded at the cop in the driver’s seat.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        The police car started with a loud rumble as the officer put the car
        into reverse before roaring off, bringing the armed investigators from
        the City Bureau with it.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Unbeknownst to them, a black SUV was parked behind their police car. As
        Ma Xiang’s car sped off, the SUV moved as well, almost grazing against a
        police car before speeding off in the opposite direction.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Fan Si sat in the backseat of the car, desperately gasping for breath.
        After he guzzled down a large bottle of water, he asked, “Brother, how
        may I address you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The young man was only focused on driving and he acted as though he
        heard nothing. It was only when Fan Si repeated the question again that
        he finally deigned to spit out two words in response. “A-Jie.”
      </p>

      <p>“Where are we going?”</p>

      <p>
        The youth named A-Jie did not immediately respond. “Have you completed
        your mission?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Damn it! I didn’t just mess up when trying to handle the target, a cop
        even interfered halfway through!&nbsp; Who knows if he was even the real
        deal? He was dressed so casually, he didn’t seem like a real cop at
        all…”
      </p>

      <p>
        A-Jie remarked indifferently, “You have been exposed. The boss wants to
        send you back to Gongzhou to lie low and wait for the wind to blow
        over.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Fan Si was extremely frustrated and indignant at the turn of events as
        he sat grumbling to himself in the backseat of the car. A-Jie ignored
        him. The distinctive features of his face were all hidden behind his
        large sunglasses and what could be seen of his face was devoid of
        expression as he concentrated on driving. It was only when they finally
        exited the flyover and entered a viaduct that he interjected Fan Si’s
        unintelligible grumbles. “There’s still four to five more hours worth of
        journey. You should grab some sleep first.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Upon realising that his grumbling only fell on deaf ears, Fan Si grunted
        in resignation. He leaned back and closed his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, Fan Si did not fall asleep. Whenever the car hit a bump, his
        eyelids would lift slightly and he would steal a glance towards the
        youth in the driver’s seat, stealthily monitoring his movements.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        In spite of Fan Si’s efforts, the young man named A-Jie maintained his
        insouciant attitude, remaining indifferent to his surroundings and was
        only focused on driving. He did not even spare Fan Si a glance from the
        rearview mirror.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        The car exited the viaduct and had been traveling on the
        inter-provincial highway for roughly an hour before the car pulled over
        abruptly, stopping by the roadside. Fan Si chose this moment to act as
        though he had just woken up—he rubbed at his eyes blearily, only to see
        A-Jie removing the keys from the ignition. Without turning his head
        around, A-Jie said, “Toilet break.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Fan Si’s own bladder was close to bursting after that large bottle of
        water he had drunk when he boarded the car, so he followed A-Jie into
        the bushes to relieve himself noisily.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        “Brother,” Fan Si said. His heightened state of wariness towards A-Jie
        had somewhat lessened. As he took out his pack of cigarettes, he took
        the initiative to offer one to A-Jie and chuckled, “I was unlucky this
        time and missed my target.&nbsp; Sorry I had to trouble you for this
        trip. Do you know how long does the boss intend for me to hide in
        Gongzhou, and whether I will still get the rest of the payment?”
      </p>

      <p>
        A-Jie accepted the cigarette but he made no move to light it. Instead,
        he asked, “Did she ever tell you about the identity of the person you
        were assigned to kill?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Fan Si said in a chiding tone, “There’s no need for a client to explain
        things thoroughly. Knowing I have business is enough information.”
      </p>

      <p>“How much is the balance?”</p>

      <p>Fan Si raised two of his fingers, then fanned out his fingers.</p>

      <p>A-Jie slowly said, “That’s quite cheap.”</p>

      <p>Fan Si was startled.</p>

      <p>
        “This amount, to buy his life. Even if you add another zero to it, it
        would still be considered too cheap.”
      </p>

      <p>“What? Then…”</p>

      <p>
        “But if it’s the price for your life,” A-Jie continued with a smile,
        “Then that’s too expensive.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As Fan Si looked at A-Jie’s smile, a sense of unease invaded his heart.
        He was a veteran in the art of cold-blooded murder, and his instincts,
        honed by the years he spent in this trade, were currently screaming at
        him. He hurriedly took two steps back—
      </p>

      <p>But it was too late.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        His vision blurred as he received a powerful kick to his chest. The wind
        howled in his ears, and he slammed into a rock with a loud crack ringing
        in his ears. He didn’t know how many ribs he broke; he could only feel
        the fresh blood bubbling in his throat and finding release through the
        gaps of his teeth, staining his mouth red.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>“Mother…fucking…bastard…”</p>

      <p>
        A-Jie strolled over. He squatted down and stared at Fan Si with a trace
        of regret in his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>“You really should not have accepted this job,” he said.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Those were the last words Fan Si heard in this world.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        His features were contorted in a cross between rage and fear. The young
        man named A-Jie wrapped a hand around Fan Si’s throat and squeezed. The
        bones in his neck broke with a clean snap.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Fan Si’s head drooped at an awkward ankle. His gaze remained fixed on
        his murderer, even as the light in his eyes faded away.
      </p>

      <p>
        A-Jie reached out and brushed his eyelids shut, his action immeasurably
        gentle, before he lifted the lifeless Fan Si into his arms and stuffing
        the body into the trunk of his car.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-wide" />

      <p>
        “I got it. Understood. Continue monitoring the roads, and call for
        reinforcements once the suspect is spotted. He is armed, so be careful.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie pressed the button of the walkie-talkie with one hand; his other
        hand was currently in the head forensic specialist, Gou Li’s, grasp. The
        edges of Yan Xie’s nails were being scraped meticulously for traces of
        the suspect’s DNA.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Vice-Captain Yan.” The forensic officer approached Yan Xie with an
        evidence bag, his expression a little disappointed. A bullet lay within
        the clear plastic. “This bullet has no rifling. It’s been shot from a
        modified gun, and the gun is probably the intricate work of a
        professional. We will perform further comparisons back when we return to
        the bureau, but it’s unlikely there will be additional findings.”
      </p>

      <p>Yan Xie nodded, signalling his acknowledgement.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        “What’s going on?” Gou Li asked, dabbing his hand carefully with a
        cotton swab stick. “Which ghost did an old man like you bump into this
        time? How is it possible that you can even manage to run into a
        gun-toting robber in broad daylight?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did you not listen in when I was reporting back to Deputy Commissioner
        Wei earlier on?” Yan Xie retorted. “We are the people’s police, bound by
        duty to step in when things get rough. How was I to know that I would be
        unlucky enough to run into someone with a gun?”
      </p>

      <p>“Where’s the unfortunate victim?’</p>

      <p>“Long gone.”</p>

      <p>
        Gou Li tutted twice in lamentation at the degeneration of morals with
        each passing generation and patted Yan Xie’s hand, a scowl on his face.
        “Enough! Fortunately, your nails are long enough—it has definitely been
        a few days since you last cut your nails. Should I also drop you off for
        a manicure on my way back, fulfilling Vice-Captain Yan’s deeply hidden
        pink maiden heart?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No need. I won’t be able to squeeze into the same car with someone your
        size,” Yan Xie replied.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>“…”</p>

      <p>
        At this moment, the intern <em>Xiao </em>Cui Sui returned from buying
        lunch for everyone. Yan Xie intercepted her and, without further ado,
        grabbed two portions of egg and sausage rolls. Carrying a paper bag in
        each hand, Yan Xie feigned a smile at Gou Li and said, “I know you’re on
        a diet, so <em>ge </em>will eat these on your behalf. You’re welcome.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gou Li snatched up two bricks and was about to hurl himself at Yan Xie
        as though it was his life at stake before he was desperately restrained
        by the forensic officers around him, who were latching on to his hands
        and feet for their dear lives. Seizing this opportunity, Yan Xie escaped
        back to his car swiftly.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>Yan Xie slammed the car door shut and turned around to look.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        On the large expanse of leather that made up the Phaeton’s backseat,
        Jiang Ting sat with his hands folded over his lap in a refined posture.
        The cold air from the car’s air conditioning system blew directly into
        his face, causing the lower half of his face that was not covered by the
        sunglasses to turn pale.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Through his reflection in the one-way window, his side profile revealed
        a delicate yet harsh expression.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie observed him carefully, and Jiang Ting returned his gaze
        impassively.&nbsp; After a moment, Yan Xie tossed him one of the bags he
        took from the intern and said, “Eat up. Let’s fill our bellies then get
        to work.”
      </p>

      <p>“What work?”</p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie eagerly removed the plastic packaging of the food and took a
        huge bite of the freshly fried sausage roll. His voice was muffled as he
        said between bites, “Ma Xiang sent word earlier—there were witnesses who
        saw the suspect rushing past them at the entrance of the China
        Construction Bank building near Zonghuan road, at around 12.10pm
        earlier. However, when the police arrived five minutes later, there was
        nobody in sight. The surveillance cameras along the roads are all being
        reviewed. We’ve even involved the Traffic Police Bureau and Public
        Security Unit, but no trace of the suspect has been found.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting ate his food slowly as he listened attentively without
        responding.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        “When I was busy exchanging blows with the suspect, it was already close
        to noon. The distance from here to the China Construction Bank is at
        least 2 kilometres—that is to say, the suspect was running at a speed of
        200 metres per minute. According to this estimation, the best area to
        conduct a search would be the 1 kilometre radius around the bank. Yet,
        the police blockade from Zhongzheng Road to Mingguang road—and the
        further extension to Jinyuan road as well as the nearby viaduct—yielded
        no results, despite the extensive search conducted.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie paused, leveling a stare at Jiang Ting. “What should we do now?”
        he asked. “Any suggestions?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Under Yan Xie’s scorching gaze, Jiang Ting was unperturbed as he took a
        small bite of the sausage. He only started speaking after he was done
        chewing and swallowing his mouthful of food. “I’m just a common
        civilian,” he said. “What suggestions could I possibly offer? I don’t
        know how to solve cases.”
      </p>

      <p>“That person was after your life, and you don’t even care?”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting replied, “It’s precisely because I care that I dare not make
        careless remarks. This is best handled by a professional.”
      </p>

      <p>Yan Xie choked on his flawless response.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting took another small bite of his food, chewing and swallowing
        leisurely. There was a flash of pink as his tongue darted out to lick
        off the soy milk dip that stained his upper lips. It was only for a few
        milliseconds, but that small action sparked a twitch in Yan Xie’s
        eyelid. He shifted his gaze away and said, “Judging from your attitude,
        there seems to be quite a few people out for your blood?”
      </p>

      <p>“You’ll get used to it.”</p>

      <p>“…”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting’s manner of eating was similar to how he did everything
        else—gentle and refined, as though he was the only one present. Yan Xie
        watched him as he meticulously nibbled away at the sausage that was
        wrapped in the roll. He snapped his gaze away, but he didn’t know what
        was going on in his mind as his gaze flitted back to Jiang Ting
        immediately after. This continued for a few more moments before he
        couldn’t hold it in any longer and burst out, “Can you not eat the
        sausage in this manner?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Ting looked at Yan Xie questioningly.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        “Next time, can you not eat the sausage this way in front of other
        people?’
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting was rendered speechless by this outburst. He retorted, “How
        do you think it should be eaten then?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yan Xie turned towards the steering wheel and sat with his back
        straight, not looking at Jiang Ting. Minutes passed before he rubbed a
        hand over his face and turned back to face Jiang Ting, his handsome face
        devoid of expression. It was as though he was trying to pretend that the
        earlier exchange of words did not take place at all.&nbsp;
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s talk about something else—a plastic factory, a chain of
        explosions, a devastating fire that laid the entire plant to ruins. A
        person who dashed straight into the sea of flames—how would such a
        person escape unscathed?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s fine if you do not wish to discuss the gun-toting suspect; we can
        discuss another puzzle instead.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Ting’s movements faltered for a split second. His throat bobbed as
        he swallowed his last bite of the egg roll. He gathered all the trash
        and stuffed them into the paper bag, then proceeded to scrupulously run
        a wet napkin over his fingers, cleaning them one by one. His actions
        were calm and unbetraying of his emotions. With the same calmness, he
        then reached over to open the door.
      </p>

      <p><em>Click</em>.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Yan Xie locked the door.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        Their gazes collided. With the ghost of a smile upon his lips, Yan Xie
        asked, “Where do you think you’re going, Mr. Lu?”
