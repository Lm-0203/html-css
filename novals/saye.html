      <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
      <p>
        The mobile phone in his pocket had been
        <span
          class="word"
          title="/ ˈvaɪbret / v. 振动，（使）震动；颤抖；共鸣；萦绕；（钟摆）摆动（vibrate 的现在分词）"
          >vibrating</span
        >
        for a while, and after the fifth time in only three minutes, Jiang Cheng
        finally decided to open his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The coach bus had been on the road for nearly three hours now, and the
        sky beyond the window rested stilly – decidedly burdened with
        gloominess. Meanwhile, the young girl beside him was sound asleep with
        her forehead stitched incommodiously on his right-side shoulder as if it
        was a free-for-all travel pillow, rendering it downright paralyzed.
      </p>

      <p>
        He shrugged his shoulder, somewhat irritated. When the girl made a
        slight turn of her head, he pushed it away with his finger. But within
        seconds, it dropped anchor on his shoulder once more.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that kind of motion repeating several times, he believed that this
        girl was not asleep but rather in a coma.
      </p>

      <p><em>How irritating.</em></p>

      <p>
        He did not know how much longer it would take until he reached the
        station since he did not check the time when he had first received the
        ticket in his hands. What he knew was that he was going on a journey to
        a small town that he had never even heard of before.
      </p>

      <p><em>Life, was quite wonderful.</em></p>

      <p>
        When his mobile phone vibrated for the sixth time, Jiang Cheng exhaled
        and took it out.
      </p>

      <p>– What happened?</p>

      <p>– How come you never mentioned that you were leaving?</p>

      <p>– Why did you leave so suddenly?</p>

      <p>– Why didn’t you tell me?</p>

      <p><em>How come? How come? How come? Why? Why? Why? BLABLABLABLA</em>…</p>

      <p>
        The messages were sent from Yu Xin, and they were most likely sent while
        she was making up a missed class, evident in the fact that she did not
        call directly. With a glance, Jiang Cheng could clearly see that they
        all ended with a question mark.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he was about to put the phone away, the seventh message came.
      </p>

      <p>– If you don’t reply, I will take it as we have broken up!</p>

      <p>
        Finally, it was not a question mark. He let out a sigh of relief, turned
        the phone off and put it back in his pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        For him, breaking up held no significant, since a relationship that went
        on for simply two months in high school was nothing more than having
        something else to talk about compared to the other students; it was in
        the sense that someone brought him breakfast, and there was always a
        dedicated cheerleading squad during a ballgame… it was not as if there
        was an opportunity for any further development.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he looked at the scenery outside that constantly changed, yet also
        somehow appeared the same the entire time, the broadcaster finally
        announced Jiang Cheng’s destination. The girl beside him moved her head,
        looking as though she was about to wake up. He quickly took out a red
        pen from his school bag, pulled off the cap and held it in his hand –
        turning it around and around.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the girl eventually woke up and picked up her face, there was a
        large imprint on her forehead as if she had practiced a fatal position
        of qigong.
      </p>

      <p>
        After her gaze met with his, the girl wiped the corner of her mouth and
        blasély took out her mobile phone. Then, as she lowered her head and
        played on her phone, she nonchalantly said: “Sorry.”
      </p>

      <p>
        To his surprise, why was it that he could not hear anything remotely
        close to an apology? Jiang Cheng smiled at her meaningfully. That look
        gave her a rude awakening before her line of sight fell on the pen
        rotating in his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng firmly pressed the cap back on the pen, hard enough for it
        to create a crisp closing sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        Two seconds later, she suddenly covered her face, stood up and rushed
        towards the bathroom at full speed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng also stood up and looked outside the window again – the long
        stygian journey here was at last met with fallen snow. He took his
        suitcase off the luggage rack, put on his jacket and walked towards the
        side door of the bus, then pulled his mobile phone out and turned it
        back on.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mobile phone was very quiet. Yu Xin’s messages no longer sounded or
        were being received.
      </p>

      <p>
        He felt that since the days he was with Yu Xin, this was the very first
        time she had made him happy – it had certainly not been easy.
      </p>

      <p>
        But there was also no one else who had contacted him aside from Yu Xin.
      </p>

      <p>
        For instance, he had thought someone would come to pick him up at the
        station.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he followed the crowd of people out of the bus station, Jiang Cheng
        zipped up his down-filled jacket all the way up and looked at the city
        that appeared gray and dejected in the frigid winter.
      </p>

      <p>
        The chaos and declining structure around the station were his first
        impression of the city.
      </p>

      <p>
        No, those were considered the second impression. The first impression
        was when his mother declared, ‘go back, that place is where your real
        family lives’ and thrust him into a blank state of mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        He dragged his suitcase to the southernmost part of the coach bus
        station square where there were only a few people. To the side was a
        small street lined up with all kinds of inns that had an eerie
        atmosphere looming above them; it was as though once you entered, it
        would be impossible to exit. There were also questionable small
        restaurants with an aura that screamed, ‘if you eat here, you’ll be
        poisoned’.
      </p>

      <p>
        He sat on his suitcase and looked at his phone, still no one had
        contacted him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although he had both the phone number and address that he needed, he did
        not want to move, he did not want to talk… repeat, he did not want to
        move. He fished out a stick of cigarette from his pocket and let it hang
        loose in his mouth. As for suddenly being driven there, he was teeming
        with a deep and inexplicable sense of loss, despair and anger.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stared at the ice on the ground in vexation and flicked his lighter
        on. When the bitter arctic wind rushed forward from behind his back, he
        curled up and lit the cigarette. The smoke that drifted in front of him
        seemed mesmerizing and kept his attention until he eventually let out a
        sigh.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the teacher in charge of his class was to see him now, he frankly
        would not know what to say at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, it was not important anymore; he was already there, in a
        far-flung corner of the world – not to mention the teacher, even the
        people that had been in the same classroom as him for more than ten
        years would, perhaps, no longer be able to see him.
      </p>

      <p>
        For all he knew, no one in the worn-out small school of this small and
        broken-down city would stare at whether or not he smoked.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he had only smoked half the cigarette, Jiang Cheng could no longer
        endure the cold air. He stood up and decided that he would hail a taxi
        and find a place to eat first. But just as he dragged his suitcase only
        one step forward, he felt something bump into his ankle; the force could
        not be described as minimal as the collision galvanized a burst of pain
        into his nerves.
      </p>

      <p>
        He frowned and turned his head around only to see a skateboard behind
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without lifting his head to see where the skateboard had flown from, a
        person fell down beside his foot.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How come you’re…” He habitually reached out to help the person up but
        froze halfway.
      </p>

      <p>
        A disheveled set of hair that seemed to have been nibbled on by an
        unhinged dog was long and short in length, and even their clothes were
        relatively filthy… <em>a beggar? Wayfarer? Swindler? Thief?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        When the person looked up, Jiang Cheng saw clearly that it was a little
        girl who appeared to be in the fifth or sixth grade of primary school.
        Even though her face was completely smeared with mud, it was possible to
        see that her skin was outstandingly fine with fairly Big Eyes, full of
        youth and innocence.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wanted to help her up again, but just before his hand could move,
        this little girl was pulled away by four or five more other little girls
        who had followed her closely; someone even kicked her in the back, which
        made her stumble, nearly falling down to the ground again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng understood what was happening immediately. He hesitated for
        a moment, then turned around and continued on his way with his suitcase
        in hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        A burst of laughter from behind was the sole reason why his footstep
        came to another halt.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he was in a terrible mood, he did not want to meddle in other
        people’s affairs. By chance, his mood was at the pinnacle of what was
        considered ‘terrible’. But that little girl’s big, black and clear eyes
        prompted him to turn back. 　
      </p>

      <p>“Hey!” he shouted.</p>

      <p>
        A couple of the girls stopped, while the one that seemed to be the
        leader of the group shot him a callous glance. “What do you want?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng slowly dragged his suitcase over and stared at the leader’s
        hand that was still gripping ‘Big Eyes’ shirt. After two seconds, the
        leader loosened her hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that, he pulled ‘Big Eyes’ to his side and glared at the other
        girls. “Nothing, just go.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who are you, huh?!” The leader was somewhat cowardly, yet still yelled
        with dissatisfaction.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I am a big brother with a knife,” Jiang Cheng said as he looked at her.
        “I can give you a haircut similar to hers in only thirty seconds.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I will call my brother here to put you in your place!” The leader was
        obviously not a habitual criminal as she pulled back a bit at her own
        words, even her mouth was unconvincing.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then let him hurry up.” Jiang Cheng dragged his suitcase with one hand
        and pulled ‘Big Eyes’ with the other. “I’m scared to death, so I’ll make
        sure to run extra fast.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After those girls left, ‘Big Eyes’ struggled free of his hold instead.
      </p>

      <p>“Are you okay?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        ‘Big Eyes’ shook her head and walked over to the skateboard, then placed
        one foot on it and looked at him.
      </p>

      <p>“Yours?” Jiang Cheng asked again.</p>

      <p>
        She nodded, then lightly pressed her foot down and skated toward him.
        After she came to a steady stop, she still stared at him with those
        large eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You should… go back home.” Jiang Cheng nodded casually before he took
        out his phone for the nth time and walked to the side, intending to call
        for a taxi.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he walked for a while, he heard a sound from behind him. He peered
        back only to see that ‘Big Eyes’ was on her skateboard, following him at
        a leisure pace.
      </p>

      <p>“What’s wrong?” Jiang Cheng looked at her.</p>

      <p>‘Big Eyes’ did not say anything.</p>

      <p>
        “Are you scared they will come back?” Jiang Cheng asked again without
        any other choice.
      </p>

      <p>‘Big Eyes’ shook her head.</p>

      <p>
        “You’re not mute, are you?” Jiang Cheng started to feel a bit annoyed.
      </p>

      <p>‘Big Eyes’ continued to shake her head.</p>

      <p>
        “I’m telling you, I…” Jiang Cheng pointed at himself, “I’m in a very
        bad, very agitated mood right now. I won’t be lenient with hitting a
        little girl, you know.”
      </p>

      <p>‘Big Eyes’ did not budge.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at her for a while longer. Then, seeing that she had
        no intention of speaking, he held back his anger and dragged his
        suitcase forward… again.
      </p>

      <p>
        The signal around the area was not good, and the app to call for the
        taxi would not open for the life of him. All he could do was sit his
        butt down on a block of stone near the public transportation stop and
        light a stick of cigarette.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Big Eyes’, who was still on her skateboard, eventually stopped right
        beside him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is there something else?” Jiang Cheng asked impatiently, now feeling
        slightly regretful for meddling earlier and putting himself in another
        weird situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Big Eyes’ still did not utter a word as she lightly kicked her feet on
        the ground and skateboarded to a spot underneath the small bus station
        roof; she looked up and stared at the sky above for a long time.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time she skateboarded back to where he was, Jiang Cheng had
        guessed the reason for her confused expression. He sighed and asked,
        “Are you lost? And don’t know your way back?”
      </p>

      <p>‘Big Eyes’ nodded.</p>

      <p>“Are you a local?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>A nod.</p>

      <p>
        “Call someone in your family to come and pick you up.” Jiang Cheng said
        and passed his own mobile phone over to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        She took the phone, hesitated for a moment before she lowered her head
        and pressed some numbers, then handed it back to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What is it?” Jiang Cheng saw that she had already pressed the numbers
        but did not make the call. “You want me to help you call them?”
      </p>

      <p>A nod.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Jiang Cheng’s brows twisted as he pressed down on the call
        button. But as he listened to the dial tone, he remembered something and
        quickly asked, “Whose number in your family is this?”
      </p>

      <p>Before ‘Big Eyes’ could reply, someone, answered the call.</p>

      <p>
        Of course, having guessed that she would not respond, Jiang Cheng simply
        said, ‘hello’.　
      </p>

      <p>“Who is this?” A young man’s voice sounded from the other side.</p>

      <p>
        “A bystander,” Jiang Cheng simply said, not knowing actually how to say
        it. “There is a little girl here…”
      </p>

      <p>“I don’t want anything,” the person said.</p>

      <p>
        Before Jiang Cheng could return to his senses, the call was
        disconnected.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who was that person?” Jiang Cheng spat the cigarette out and pointed at
        ‘Big Eyes’. “If you’re not going to talk, then get lost. I don’t have
        any more patience.”
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Big Eyes’ squatted beside Jiang Cheng’s leg, picked up a stone and
        wrote a single character on the ground, “brother”, and then looked back
        up at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay, I got it.” Jiang Cheng felt that this little girl may actually be
        mute.
      </p>

      <p>
        He dialed that number again. This time, it only sounded for a moment
        before the call connected. “Who is this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at the little girl, “Your little sister is here with
        me…”
      </p>

      <p>“Kill the hostage,” the person answered and then hung up again.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!!” Jiang Cheng had an impulse to smash his phone as he pointed at
        her, “Your name!”
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Big Eyes’ lowered her head and used the stone to write her own name.
      </p>

      <p>顾淼 Gu Miao.</p>

      <p>
        This time, Jiang Cheng did not call and only sent a text message with a
        picture of ‘Big Eyes’.
      </p>

      <p>– Gu Miao, mute, skateboard.</p>

      <p>Thirty seconds later, his phone went off.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng connected the call, “It’s too late, the hostage is dead.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m sorry,” the person said. “Can you tell me where she’s? I’ll head
        over and see if she can be saved.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… the east side of the train station, the especially run-down one.”
        Jiang Cheng’s brows tightened, “She got lost. You should hurry up, I
        have things to do.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Thank you, thank you very much!” the person answered. “I’ll be there
        immediately. If you have any urgent matter, you can leave first. She can
        wait for me there.”
      </p>

      <p>
        With that settled, Jiang Cheng picked up the half-smoked cigarette that
        he had thrown on the ground and threw it in the trash bin to the side
        before lighting up another one.
      </p>

      <p>
        He originally wanted to directly hail a taxi and leave but thinking that
        no one cared whether or not he went and whether or not he was there, he
        did not seem to be in a rush.
      </p>

      <p>
        After sitting on the skateboard for a while, Gu Miao stood up and rode
        it back and forth on the sidewalk.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at her, Jiang Cheng was somewhat surprised. He had thought that
        this little girl was just blindly playing around, hence he did not
        expect her to execute all kinds of upward and downward moves on the
        steps; when she sped up and then suddenly turned, it was unexpectedly
        smooth.
      </p>

      <p>
        In truth, it was the head of hair that had been cut into a disheveled
        mess, along with the filthy face and clothes that made people lose
        interest.
      </p>

      <p>
        After playing for more than ten minutes, Gu Miao rode to his side and
        stopped. Then, she firmly pressed the tip of her foot on the skateboard
        causing it to rise up. After catching it with her hand, she picked up
        her hand and pointed to somewhere behind Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That was cool!” Jiang Cheng gave Gu Miao a thumbs up and then turned
        his head around toward the direction she pointed to see a black
        motorcycle parked behind him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the person on the motorcycle was wearing a helmet, it was
        impossible to see his face clearly. But, standing there on the sidewalk,
        wearing slim-fitted gray pants that accentuated his legs and ankle boots
        to top it off just screamed very… eye-catching.
      </p>

      <p><em>Tall, and standing straight.</em></p>

      <p>“Your brother?” Jiang Cheng asked Gu Miao.</p>

      <p>Gu Miao nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “What happened to your head?” The person on the motorcycle took off his
        helmet, walked over, and stared at Gu Miao’s hair in surprise. “And your
        face, and clothes… did you fall into a pit of dung?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao shook her head. 　</p>

      <p>“She was bullied by her classmates,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “Thanks.” The person’s gaze shifted, falling on Jiang Cheng’s face. “I’m
        Gu Fei, her older brother.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng stood up and shook his hand, “You’re welcome.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei appeared to be around the same age as him, and looking at his
        eyes alone was not a good method to employ to determine whether or not
        he was Gu Miao’s brother. Although his eyes were not as big as Gu
        Miao’s, they were quite similar and… his skin was just as fair.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though Jiang Cheng’s current mood was like that of a plate of
        rotten tomato, Gu Fei’s hairstyle was just as eye-catching as his
        legs—making it impossible for him to not steal another glance or two
        from the crack of those rotten eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei had a very short crew cut. If you leaned in closer, you could
        make out the music staff shaved to the scalp on both sides of his head.
        On one side was the bass clef and the other side was a rest, but Jiang
        Cheng could not clearly decipher how many dots were present.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did you just get off the coach bus?” Gu Fei glanced at his suitcase.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>.” Jiang Cheng picked up his phone and
        continued to an app to call for a taxi.
      </p>

      <p>“Where are you heading? I can take you,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “There’s no need.” Jiang Cheng glanced at his motorcycle—no matter how
        big, it was still a motorcycle.
      </p>

      <p>“She doesn’t take up much space,” Gu Fei added.</p>

      <p>“There’s no need, but thank you,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “Tell this brother, thank you.” Gu Fei pointed to Jiang Cheng and then
        said to Gu Miao, “Dung ball.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng turned to look at the “dung ball”, wanting to hear how she
        was going to speak. As a result, Gu Miao merely hugged her skateboard
        and gave him a 90-degree bow.
      </p>

      <p>After that, Gu Fei straddled the motorbike and put on his helmet.</p>

      <p>
        “Thanks again.” Gu Fei gave him another glance, started the motorcycle
        and drove off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sat back down on the block of stone. Surprisingly, the
        wireless service was quite good at that time, but… even after what
        seemed like half a day, he still could not get a ride and all the taxis
        that he had waved for as they passed by would not fucking stop.
      </p>

      <p><em>What kind of awful place is this?</em></p>

      <p>
        Although he was in an intensely bad mood, he never had the time to
        relish it in. He only felt that he had lived in a fundamentally chaotic
        time, wrapped in all kinds of shock and sense of losses, and even the
        air around him was hard to inhale—rendering him breathless. He wondered
        why he had agreed to all of those arrangements and came here.
      </p>

      <p><em>Rebellious?</em></p>

      <p>
        Just as his mother said, “Our family has never had a rebellious person
        like you who is completely strung with thorns, always on guard and
        unapproachable.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, they were not originally a family. Not to mention, they were
        more like enemies in recent years with one getting angry at the other
        upon only one glance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng twisted his brows. He never had the time to ponder over
        those things.
      </p>

      <p>Until then, at that very moment.</p>

      <p>
        In this unfamiliar and frigid city, where the snow was floating
        majestically, he came to his senses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despair and pain, and the resistance to all the unknown made him feel
        sore.
      </p>

      <p>When he lowered his head, the tears beckoned to surface altogether.</p>

      <p>
        By the time his mobile phone sounded, Jiang Cheng was sitting inside a
        KFC that he did not even know the address of. He glanced at the strange
        number and then connected the call. “Hello?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is this Jiang Cheng?” The voice of a middle-aged man transmitted from
        the other side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the voice was a bit loud, Jiang Cheng moved the phone away from
        his ear. “Yes.”
      </p>

      <p>“I’m your dad,” the person said.</p>

      <p>
        “… oh.” Jiang Cheng grunted in approval. That kind of exchange,
        unexpectedly, sounded ridiculous – making it hard for him not to laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        That person also laughed along, “I am Li Baoguo. You should know that,
        right?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng said, sipping a cola.</p>

      <p>“Are you at the station?” Li Baoguo asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I’m here.” Jiang Cheng looked at the time,
        <em>I’ve been here for two hours.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you have the address? I don’t have a car to go, so there’s no way
        for me to go and pick you up. Take a taxi here, I’ll wait for you at the
        intersection,” Li Baoguo said.
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng hung up on the call.</p>

      <p>
        This time, luck was on his side. He was able to get a taxi immediately,
        and surprisingly, one with the heater on; warm enough to the point he
        felt feverish.
      </p>

      <p>
        The driver wanted to chat, but Jiang Cheng simply leaned against the
        window and silently gazed outside the entire time. After several
        attempts that harbored no success, the driver finally surrendered and
        switched on the radio.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng strived to clearly see what the city looked like. But the
        sky was already sheathed in darkness; the streetlights were not
        particularly bright, and the snowflakes that fluttered all around,
        seemingly overtaking all the source of light, were of no aid and instead
        made him feel faint.
      </p>

      <p>He closed his eyes.</p>

      <p>But soon reopened them.</p>

      <p>He did not know what was wrong, but he felt exceptionally listless.</p>

      <p>
        When the taxi came to a stop at the location, Jiang Cheng got out, took
        his suitcase and stood at the intersection.
      </p>

      <p>No one was there.</p>

      <p>
        The shadow of the person claiming to say, ‘I’m your dad’, with the name
        of Li Baoguo, was nowhere to be seen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng suppressed the ire in his heart, and while the pain from the
        wind cut his face, he dialed Li Baoguo’s number.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ai, this stinking…” Li Baoguo finally answered the call after a long
        while later, “Hello?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I am at the intersection.” Jiang Cheng listened to his movements on the
        other side and wanted to immediately hang up and find a hotel to stay at
        instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Huh? You arrived there that fast?” Li Baoguo exclaimed in surprise,
        “I’m here, I’m here. I will be out immediately.”
      </p>

      <p>
        That <em>immediately</em> took longer than five minutes. Just as Jiang
        Cheng dragged his suitcase to the crossroad and hailed for a taxi, a man
        wearing a Lei Feng hat ran over and pressed his hand on his shoulder. He
        shouted at the top of his lungs, “Jiang Cheng, right?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not utter a word. He had seen Li Baoguo running out of a
        residential building that was literally right behind him.
      </p>

      <p><em>Immediately uh?</em></p>

      <p>
        When he looked towards the second-floor window and saw several heads
        looking in their direction, he really did not want to talk anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I was just at a friend’s place for a while. Let’s go, let’s go.” Li
        Baoguo patted his shoulder, “Let’s go home, let’s go home… you look a
        lot taller than in the picture.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng kept his eyes down on the muddy pavement and followed him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey,” Li Baoguo patted his back for a while, “How many years has it
        been? More than ten years, right? I finally get to see my son! I have to
        take a good look.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo grabbed his head, placed it right before his eyes and stared
        at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng pulled up the face mask that was resting near his chin,
        covering half his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        He suddenly felt that his entire being had become absolutely empty, even
        the atmosphere was charged with confusion.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p class="has-text-align-right">Translate: An | Edit: Sae</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        According to his mother’s words… Jiang Cheng suddenly felt like this
        title was a bit strange. His train of thought was bizarrely abrupted,
        and whatever <em>words</em> were forgotten in a flash.
      </p>

      <span id="more-4249"></span>

      <p>
        In the past ten years or so of his life, having parents and a family was
        all he knew. Whether the relationship was good or bad, mother was always
        a woman named Shen Yi Qing, father was a man named Jiang Wei, and his
        younger brother had always been unaffectionate… now all of a sudden,
        there was another addition to the set, Li Baoguo and… a few other names
        he had already long forgotten.
      </p>

      <p>He honestly could not wrap his head around it.</p>

      <p>
        The relationship he had with his family was indeed stricken with
        tension; be it his parents or younger brother, they would all ignite
        upon contact. Thinking back, he had not talked to his brother in almost
        a year and even his overtly calm and restrained mother was often caught
        losing her composure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if that kind of situation had continued since he entered middle
        school to high school – with him having often contemplated about never
        returning home and never seeing his parents – the idea of never seeing
        the face that seemed to have been molded from ones of his parents… when
        this moment befell him like a wish coming true right before his eyes, he
        still felt shaken.
      </p>

      <p>Just shaken.</p>

      <p>Very shaken.</p>

      <p>
        Ever since his mother had said, “There’s something I have to tell you”,
        a few months of cold war and formalities pursued. Even now, everything
        that had happened felt like a dream he could not come to sense with.
      </p>

      <p>Most of the time, he did not feel much discomfort or agony.</p>

      <p>What existed was just confusion. 　　</p>

      <p>
        “Cold?” Li Baoguo turned around and coughed a few times before he asked,
        “It’s much colder here than where you previously came from, right?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng replied behind his face mask.</p>

      <p>
        “It’ll be warm once we’re inside,” Li Baoguo said. Unfortunately, he
        then coughed loud and hard enough for his spit to spray on Jiang Cheng’s
        face. “I’ve already cleaned and arranged a room especially for you.”
      </p>

      <p>“Thank you,” Jiang Cheng answered, pulling his face mask up.</p>

      <p>
        “What is there to thank between us.” Li Baoguo coughed and grinned at
        the same time as he patted Jiang Cheng’s back a few times. “There’s no
        need to say thanks between us father and son!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng could not respond. Those two slaps on his back were
        particularly vigorous. At first, he had inhaled a lung full of cold air
        and wanted to cough, but once he heard Li Baoguo cough, he wanted to
        cough even more. With two more slaps, he simply leaned towards the
        ground and coughed wildly to the point his tears nearly came out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your body isn’t that great eh,” Li Baoguo looked at him. “You have to
        exercise. When I was your age, I was as strong as a bear.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Once again, Jiang Cheng declined to answer. Instead, he bent over
        slightly and pulled out his arm, giving the man a thumbs up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo started to laugh joyously: “Exercise! I still have to depend
        on you to take care of me later on!”
      </p>

      <p>Hearing that, Jiang Cheng straightened his back and glanced at him.</p>

      <p>“Let’s go.” Li Baoguo slapped him on the back again.</p>

      <p>“Don’t touch me.” Jiang Cheng knitted his eyebrows together.</p>

      <p>
        “Yo?”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Li Baoguo froze, fairly round eyes peered
        at him, “What?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked him in the eye for a moment before he pulled down his
        mask: “Don’t slap my back.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo’s home was situated on an old, small street with little shops
        of every kind on either side. They were crippled yet full of vitality
        and breadths of life: food, clothes, and products for daily use were all
        available with low lying apartment buildings sited on top of the shops.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng raised his head to look past the intersecting electrical
        cords hanging above only to see the walls. The original color of the
        exterior walls was impossible to decipher, especially whether the dark
        gloomy color came from the sky outside or if they were originally like
        that.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a heart full of feelings, he could not quite place, he followed Li
        Baoguo into a hallway. They cut through a few piles of miscellaneous
        objects, vegetables and came to a full stop in front of a door at the
        innermost side of the first floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The environment here definitely can’t compare to the one you were
        previously in,” Li Baoguo said as he opened the door. “But what’s mine
        is yours!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything as he glanced at the hallway in which a
        light bulb was covered by spiderwebs. He could virtually feel the bulb
        being suffocated until it was unable to breathe.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s mine is yours!” Li Baoguo opened the door, turned around, and
        patted his shoulder heavily. “What’s yours is mine! That’s the
        relationship between a father and a son!”
      </p>

      <p>“I told you, don’t touch me.” Jiang Cheng said, rather irritated.</p>

      <p>
        “Yo,” Li Baoguo walked into the room and turned on the light. “You’ve
        really been spoiled rotten, talking to an elder like that. Let me tell
        you, I’ve never spoiled your brother and sister before. If you had grown
        up at home this whole time, I would’ve fixed you up with some
        beatings…come, you’ll sleep in this room… this room was previously your
        brother’s…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not listen to what Li Baoguo had to say as he dragged
        his suitcase into the room. Seeing that this apartment was only a
        two-bedroom unit, it really did make one wonder how a large family was
        previously able to live in such a small space.
      </p>

      <p>
        The room that was supposedly ‘cleaned and arranged’… was probably not
        cleaned. Without so much a glance inside and just merely smelling the
        odor, one could easily deduce that the dust particles in the air were
        mingled with a mild taste of mold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside was an old wardrobe, a study table, and a frame-rack bed piled
        with miscellaneous junk on the upper level. However, the lower level was
        clean, had a bed sheet and quilt newly washed.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Leave your things in here and arrange them tomorrow,” Li Baoguo said.
        “Let us father and son have a drink.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Drink what?” Jiang Cheng stared blankly and then took a glimpse at his
        phone; it was almost ten o’clock.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alcohol.” Li Baoguo looked at him, “We haven’t seen each other for the
        past ten years or so. It’s only natural that we have to have a drink to
        celebrate this occasion!”
      </p>

      <p>“… no,” Jiang Cheng was a bit speechless, “I don’t want to drink.”</p>

      <p>
        “You don’t want to drink?” Li Baoguo’s eyes grew in diameter. After he
        stared intently at him for a few seconds, his eyes finally contracted,
        and a smile appeared instead, “Don’t tell me you haven’t had a drink
        before? You’re already in high school…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t want to drink,” Jiang Cheng interrupted him. “I want to sleep.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sleep?” Li Baoguo froze, somewhat perplexed at such a demand. However,
        he did not question further and instead turned around to leave while
        simultaneously uttering some words with his hoarse voice. “Sure, sure,
        sure, you can sleep, sleep.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng closed the door to his room and stood still for nearly five
        minutes before he walked to the closet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the closet door opened, he was instantly paralyzed by the strong
        scent of mothballs that assaulted his senses. A wardrobe with two doors
        was completely packed halfway with quilts, blankets, old cotton-padded
        jackets, and towels that had fringes flowing like tassels from the side.
      </p>

      <p>
        This state of mind was difficult to express. Jiang Cheng was positive
        that he was not longing for the home and family members living many
        hours away. However, he sincerely started to miss his own room.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took out a few random articles of clothing from his suitcase and hung
        them in the wardrobe while the rest was kept in the suitcase and stored
        at the bottom of the wardrobe. Afterward, he grabbed a bottle of perfume
        and sprayed it inside the closet numerously before he finally closed the
        door and sat on the bedside.
      </p>
      <p>
        When his phone sounded, he took it out for a look only to see that ‘mom’
        displayed on the screen; that prompted him to answer the call.
      </p>

      <p>“Did you arrive yet?” Mother’s voice sounded from the other side.</p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng responded.</p>

      <p>
        “The conditions are not as good to the home here,” mother simply worded.
        “You will probably need some time to adjust.”
      </p>

      <p>“There’s no need.” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        Mother paused for a second, “Xiao Cheng, I still hope you don’t feel…”
      </p>

      <p>“I don’t.” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “In these ten years or so, we didn’t treat you unfairly. Your father and
        I have never let you know that you were adopted, right?” Mother’s voice
        held that usual hint of sternness.
      </p>

      <p>
        “But I still found out,” Jiang Cheng said. “And I have also been kicked
        out.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t you forget, your father ended up in the hospital on New Year’s
        because of you! He still hasn’t been discharged yet!” Mother’s voice
        increased in volume.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not respond. He truly could not understand what his
        father being admitted into the hospital, due to pneumonia, had to do
        with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        And what his mother had to say afterward, he miraculously did not hear
        it clearly. This was his skill – what was undesirable to his ear could
        not enter his brain regardless of anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mother’s harsh yet vacuous criticism and what he considered to be a
        completely ineffective conversation, was the binding seal for his break
        down.
      </p>

      <p>
        He did not want to listen. He did not want to quarrel in this alien
        environment that caused his whole body to fall into discomfort.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the call ended, he could no longer remember the things that were
        said. What mother said, what he said, all were already forgotten.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>I want to take a shower</em>, Jiang Cheng stood up and went to open
        the door. When he looked into the living room, there was no one there.
      </p>

      <p>
        He cleared his throat and coughed a few times, but still, no one
        responded.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you…there?” He walked into the living room, truthfully unsure of
        what to call Li Baoguo.
      </p>

      <p>
        The room was very small and standing in the living room one could easily
        see the doors to the bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. Li Baoguo was not in
        the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >He probably went out to play cards. He’s the kind of person who
          stayed to play a few more rounds instead of picking someone up from
          the intersection.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        “Come on —let’s play cards ah— there’s a lot of time anyway.” Jiang
        Cheng sang as he pushed open the bathroom door. “Come on —let’s bathe
        ah— anyways…”
      </p>

      <p>There was no water heater in the bathroom.</p>

      <p>
        “Anyways…” he continued to sing as he turned around to look into the
        kitchen that was connected to the bathroom. There was no water heater
        there either; only an electric heater was attached to the faucet.
        “Anyways…”
      </p>

      <p>
        He could no longer sing. After he paced around the room a few more times
        to confirmed that there was indeed no water heater, he only felt his
        heart stifling. His hand smashed against the faucet. “Fuck.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Having wandered around all day, it would be impossible for him to fall
        asleep without showering.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, he had no choice but to return to his room and drag out his
        luggage. He pulled out a collapsible bucket and carried buckets after
        buckets of water into the bathroom, all the while only wearing his
        underpants. Going back and forth, half-rubbing and half-washing himself,
        he eventually finished up.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he walked out of the bathroom, a cockroach ran past his feet. He
        leaped up to avoid it, almost hitting his head on the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng returned to his room and turned off the light in an
        attempt to force himself to sleep, he noticed that the room had no
        curtains, and the reason he was unable to see the scene outside was due
        to the filthy window.
      </p>

      <p>
        He pulled the cover up, but out of hesitation, he tugged at the corner
        for a sniff. Once he confirmed that it was clean, he let out a sigh of
        relief but truthfully, he wasn’t even in the mood to even sigh.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng kept his eyes closed for over half an hour, however, even
        when his eyes felt sore, sleep still did not succumb. Just as he was
        thinking of having a cigarette, his phone buzzed.
      </p>

      <p>He picked it up for a glance, it was Pan Zhi who sent him a text.</p>

      <p>– What the fuck, you left? What the hell is going on?</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng lit a cigarette and dialed Pan Zhi’s number, and as he held
        the cigarette in his mouth, he moved toward the window and thought about
        opening it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, the window was veiled by dust and rust. He fidgeted for a
        while, and even when Pan Zhi had already answered the phone, the window
        did not move a single jot.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng?” Pan Zhi had his voice lowered to the volume of a thief on the
        job.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Jiang Cheng’s finger was pricked by some unidentified foreign
        object. He tightened his brows and swore to himself, finally giving up
        on the thought of opening the window.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s your situation?” Pan Zhi’s voice was still restrained. “Today, I
        heard from Yu Xin that you left? Didn’t you say that you’d tell when you
        were leaving? I even bought a pile of gifts to see you off with!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Mail them to me.” Jiang Cheng pulled on his coat, and with the
        cigarette in his mouth, he walked into the living room. But just as he
        opened the door and took the first step out, he realized that he did not
        have the keys to this place. With no choice but to retreat, Jiang Cheng
        opened the window in the living room instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        His current mood was as appalling as a violent windstorm. As long as
        another cent of displeasure came his way, he would be able to break out
        into a verse of battle songs, full of anger and annoyance.
      </p>

      <p>“You’re already there?” Pan Zhi asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng leaned against the windowsill and looked out into the
        onyx-colored darkness of the street.
      </p>

      <p>
        “So, how is it? How’s that biological father of yours?” Pan Zhi
        questioned again.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you have a matter to discuss?” Jiang Cheng said, “I don’t want to
        talk right now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shit, it’s not like I was the one who threw you there,” Pan Zhi raged.
        “What are you getting irritated at me for? When your mother proposed
        that, ‘an agreement from the adoptee must be obtained’, you didn’t
        hesitate at all, <em>now</em> you’re sulking!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Not hesitating doesn’t conflict with displeasure.” Jiang Cheng blew out
        a mouthful of smoke.
      </p>

      <p>
        The road that did not have a soul in sight suddenly produced a small
        thin human shadow; with a step on the skateboard, it flew by at a
        surprising speed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng got distracted and thought back to the little girl called Gu
        Miao.
        <em
          >There sure are a lot of people playing with skateboards in this lousy
          little town.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>“How about I go there?” Pan Zhi suddenly asked.</p>

      <p>“En?”Jiang Cheng did a double take.</p>

      <p>
        “I said I’ll go and visit you,” Pan Zhi restated. “There’s still a
        couple days left before school starts. I can personally deliver the
        things I bought for you too.”
      </p>

      <p>“No.” Jiang Cheng rejected.</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t be stubborn with me, you didn’t tell anyone else your situation.
        Right now, you only have me to provide you some warmth.” Pan Zhi sighed,
        “Just let me go and comfort you.”
      </p>

      <p>“Comfort how,” Jiang Cheng declared, “With your mouth?”</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck! Damn you Jiang Cheng, have a bit of shame,<a href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >
        okay?!” Pan Zhi screamed from the other side.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Since you’re so enthusiastic and adamant about seeing me off, what do I
        need shame for? I should cooperate with you.” Jiang Cheng circled the
        room with the cigarette in his hand and found an ‘eight treasures congee
        can’<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> covered by cigarette ashes. When he opened
        it, the years of built-up cigarette odor almost caused him to vomit
        before he even had time to clearly identify the content inside.
      </p>

      <p>
        He threw the cigarette butt inside and closed the lid—at that moment, he
        felt like he never wanted to smoke ever again for the rest of his life.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was a strange and displeasing environment, with a strange and
        displeasing “family”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng thought this situation would cause him insomnia, but as he
        laid on the bed, the agony from not being able to fall asleep vanished.
        He unexpectedly realized he was sleepy, and not just sleepy—it was
        drowsiness along with the extreme fatigue, similar to having spent over
        half a month pulling late-nights cramming for exams.
      </p>

      <p>How very unexpected.</p>

      <p>
        After he closed his eyes, he slept as if he lost had all consciousness.
      </p>

      <p>A night without dreams.</p>

      <p>
        When he woke up in the morning to the initial sensation of his entire
        body feeling sore, Jiang Cheng had the conception of his real identity
        being a worker carrying heavy loads at the dock, the kind where he had
        yet to finish his weekly portions of work.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked at his phone for the time. It was quite early, only a bit over
        eight.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he put on his clothes and walked out of the room, he saw that
        everything in the room had maintained its arrangement from the previous
        night, even the other unoccupied bedroom had a bed that remained the
        same.
      </p>

      <p><em>Li Baoguo didn’t return for the whole night?</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng tightened his brows. After he finished washing up, he felt a
        bit embarrassed. His attitude last night was a bit harsh—there were no
        bad intentions behind Li Baoguo pulling him for a drink since it
        honestly could only count as having different habits, yet he harshly
        rejected the offer.
        <em
          >It can’t be that Li Baoguo didn’t return all night because of that,
          right?</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        He hesitated for a bit and took out his phone with the intention of
        giving Li Baoguo a call. Although they did not drink together last
        night, there should not be a problem with having breakfast together in
        the morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he was dialing the numbers, the sound of keys jingling passed through
        the door, and the lock followed suit. The sounds sustained for twenty,
        thirty seconds before the door was finally opened.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo walked in, enveloped in a body of cold air. His face was dim
        and his features full of fatigue.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re up?” Li Baoguo’s loud voice sounded as he saw Jiang Cheng, “You
        woke up quite early, did you sleep well?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… not bad.” Jiang Cheng got a whiff of thick cigarette smell from Li
        Baoguo as he answered, it was also mixed with some ineffable foul scent
        – like the red, green leathered train seats from long ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Have you eaten breakfast?” Li Baoguo took off his coat, shook it, and
        the smell grew stronger. The living room that was not big, to begin
        with, was now filled with the strange odor.
      </p>

      <p>“Not yet,” Jiang Cheng said. “How about we…”</p>

      <p>
        “There are many shops that sell breakfast right outside, you can go
        eat,” Li Baoguo said. “I’m tired so I’m going to take a nap first. If I
        don’t wake up at noon, you can also eat by yourself.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng watched as he entered the other bedroom, and without taking
        off any of his clothes, he crashed onto the bed and pulled the cover up.
        He speechlessly asked: “Last night… what were you doing?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Playing cards. Lately, my luck has been really bad. But it was quite
        good yesterday! You, my boy, have brought me good fortune!” Li Baoguo
        happily said as he closed his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took the pair of keys that were placed on the table and
        turned to exit the door. He felt that his embarrassment from early was
        much too naive.
      </p>

      <p>
        The snow had stopped yet the air that swept by was frigid and cutting as
        it penetrated his bones.
      </p>

      <p>
        The narrow streets contained more liveliness in the morning with people
        and cars in sight, and even the sound of firecrackers could be heard.
        However, when everything became bright, the dilapidation soon became
        visible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wandered the streets back and forth until he eventually
        walked into a dumpling house. Having eaten a few stuffed-buns and a bowl
        of tender tofu-curd, he still did not feel the sore pain leave his body.
        On the contrary, it seemed to have awakened further unpleasantness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thinking that he might have caught a cold, he bought a box of medicine
        from the nearby drugstore after breakfast.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he purchased the medicine, he stood on the sides of the street
        feeling a little uncertain. <em>Should I go back?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The image of Li Baoguo falling into bed encased in a body of weird odor
        perturbed him, he was not sure what he could even do once he returned.
      </p>

      <p><em>To sleep or to stare blankly into space?</em></p>

      <p>
        He stood at the front of the drugstore for a few minutes and decided to
        stroll around nearby as to get familiar with the place he was not sure
        how long he would be residing.
      </p>

      <p>
        He walked aimlessly along an alleyway onto the main street and made a
        turn into another small alley that was parallel to the previous. Jiang
        Cheng wanted to determine whether there was a direct path that could
        take him back or not.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this alley, he saw a small music store and an ice cream shop with an
        interior that was very pinkish and delicately decorated. But aside from
        these two stores, the other stores were no different from the previous
        street.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he passed by a place that was decorated like a small supermarket but
        was actually just a shop for miscellaneous goods, he stopped and pushed
        the door in, intending to buy a bottle of water so that he could take
        the medicine.
      </p>
      <p>
        When warm air mixed with the musky scent of lemons struck him in the
        face upon stepping in the store, he stopped at the entrance and
        immediately wanted to turn back.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were four people crammed in the small area behind the cash
        register counter—everyone was either sitting or leaning on the chair.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment he entered, the people who were originally chatting, all
        stopped abruptly and simultaneously cranked their heads to stare at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng studied these four people, from their physical features to
        their facial expression, from their apparels to mannerism; each of their
        faces seemed to have a single character spelled on it.
      </p>

      <p>不，是，好，鸟。Bu, Shi, Hao, Niao<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>

      <p>
        Just as he was hesitating on whether to turn around and leave or to grab
        a bottle of water from the nearby shelf, the corner of Jiang Cheng’s
        eyes landed on three other people who were crammed in front of the
        storage rack.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned his head but did not see the people clearly. First, he saw a
        floor full of hair and a glossy bald head, followed by a pair of big
        eyes.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        The glossy bald head in front of the storage shelves belonged to Gu
        Miao. After this young girl had completely shaved her head, it was
        impossible to tell that she was a girl—not to mention, she had on a
        boy’s greyish-blue down-filled jacket. If it were not for her eyes,
        Jiang Cheng would not have been able to recognize that this was Gu Miao.
      </p>

      <span id="more-4525"></span>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was standing behind her with an electric hair clipper in his hand
        and a cigarette hanging loosely in his mouth. He must have been somewhat
        surprised to see him since the clipper that was once moving came to a
        complete standstill.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, Gu Fei was dressed entirely different than the day before, as
        he was sporting a pullover and casual pants that were comfortable and
        relaxed.
      </p>

      <p>
        From his physical appearance to his attire and then his temperament, one
        could immediately tell he was of a different type of person from his
        four friends—very eye-catching—the kind that you could instantly
        distinguish from within a pile of people.
      </p>

      <p>His whole body exuded an aura of “I am their boss”.　</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had always thought that his own appearance did not promote
        him as a bad person. Although his bad temper would sometimes even scare
        himself, he had simply thought of it as a rebellious stage lingering
        longer than the average… but under the situation of just calmly wanting
        to buy a bottle of water, he definitely looked harmless.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, when the people in this miscellaneous goods shop, that was decorated
        to look like a small supermarket, all stared at him and kept silent with
        a face that seemed to say, “are you looking for a fight”, he felt
        utterly baffled.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the process, a chunk of the ash from the cigarette in Gu Fei’s mouth
        fell on Gu Miao’s bald head. She patted her head for a while just to get
        rid of the ash.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had no intention of concerning himself with these people’s
        stares. He had always been a young man unafraid of large issues and
        fearless towards the ‘what are you looking at’ type of stares,
        especially when it came to times that his mood and health were
        concurrently unpleasant.
      </p>

      <p>
        He walked to the front of the shelf and took a bottle of mineral spring
        water.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked up only to see that Gu Fei had already walked to the side of
        the shelf, and after silently staring at each other from across two
        containers of chips, Gu Fei said: “Welcome.”
      </p>

      <p>“Your family’s shop?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>“What a coincidence,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei went silent. He also did not want to speak again, so he tossed
        the water in his hand back and forth and then turned around and walked
        to the checkout counter.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        “Two kuai,” someone walked behind the counter and propped his hand on
        the table before leaning over to stare at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng gave him a glance. With the ‘Bu Shi Hao Niao’ team of four
        still sitting at the same spot, this person was the one who was standing
        beside Gu Fei just now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the lighting was dim before, he could not see clearly, but now
        that he was beneath the light, he discovered that<a href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
        this person was very beautiful—like a young woman. Aside from his long
        and narrow eyes, the other features of this person made him seem more
        like Gu Miao’s sister than… Gu Fei as her brother.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took ten kuai out of his pocket and passed them over. The man took
        the money, lowered his head and poked the cash register a few times and
        then glanced at him. “Da<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Fei’s friend? I’ve
        never seen you before.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No.” Jiang Cheng took out the medicine, broke it into two, and placed
        it in his mouth before he unscrewed the water bottle and drank a few
        gulps.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No?” The man’s gaze crossed over his shoulder as he looked to the back,
        then he placed the change on the table. “Oh.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After he took the medicine, Jiang Cheng threw away the half-drunken
        water in the trash can by the door, lift the curtain and walked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey, it would have been better if you bought a smaller bottle,” the
        man’s voice sailed from behind him, “So wasteful.”
      </p>

      <p>“… I forgot,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        <em
          >That’s right. Why didn’t I buy a small bottle? I didn’t even finish
          it.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps it was because the severe aching sensation in his body was
        intensifying, but his brain was spinning continuously.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he stood on the steps of the entranceway, he couldn’t remember where
        he wanted to go before he entered the store…
        <em>Go back? Go back to where? Li Baoguo… no, his new home?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        When he thought of the harsh environment here and the thunderous sound
        of Li Baoguo’s snores, his chest felt blocked and immediately after, he
        couldn’t breathe… he couldn’t at all.
      </p>

      <p>Before him, darkness appeared as a golden flower blossomed.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng couldn’t control his body at all, and just like a spinning
        sack sinking down, he sighed – <em>wonderful</em>.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao touched her own bald head and then walked towards the door with
        her skateboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hat,” Gu Fei said from behind as he picked up his coat from the chair
        next to him. Then he took out a green woolen hat with small flowers from
        his pocket and threw it on her head.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao pulled the hat down a bit to wear it properly.</p>

      <p>
        She bowed her head and dragged the skateboard out of the shop, but soon
        returned and smacked the checkout counter a few times.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What happened?” Li Yan leaned over the counter, pulled her hat and then
        looked up at Gu Fei. “How could you actually knit her a green hat<a
          href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >, huh…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “She picked the color herself,” Gu Fei replied as he put the electric
        hair clipper away and glanced at Gu Miao. “What’s wrong?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao pointed towards the door.</p>

      <p>
        “Is there a dog?” Gu Fei kicked the chair to the side, then walked
        towards the entrance and lifted the curtain.
      </p>

      <p>
        That Mr. Wealthy who had previously bought a bottle of water and threw
        it away after only drinking half of it was now lying on the sidewalk
        outside the door.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>His face was kissing Mother Earth.</p>

      <p>
        “Hey,” Gu Fei walked out and used his foot to lightly kick his leg, and
        since he did not know what this person’s name was, he simply asked: “Are
        you okay?”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Mr. Wealthy did not move, he stooped down to look at his face that
        was on the ground, only to see that the tip of his nose was pressed
        flatten to the ground. He reached out and carefully propped Mr.
        Wealthy’s head to the side so he could breathe properly. Afterward, he
        turned his head and shouted toward the shop: “Hey! Someone collapsed
        here!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Yan came out first and when he saw the scene, he stared in shock:
        “Was he stabbed?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You must have stabbed him.” Gu Fei touched Mr. Wealthy’s face and felt
        the scalding hot temperature on his hand. “He has a fever.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can faint from a fever?” Li Yan was a little surprised as he turned
        around to look at the few people who followed out. “What should we do?
        Call 120?”<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t worry about it.” Liu Fan looked around, “A cautious auntie will
        report this to the police in a bit and they will definitely say that we
        did it. I just came out yesterday…”
      </p>

      <p>“Drag him in,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“Drag in… you know him, right?” Liu Fan asked.</p>

      <p>
        “If he tells you to drag him in, just drag him in. Even if he doesn’t
        know him, Da Fei touched him just now,” Li Yan said. “If an auntie
        really reports this, do you think the police won’t question?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “He just passed out from a fever, you guys should feel apologetic to
        your fathers and mothers for not becoming playwrights,” Gu Fei said as
        he turned Mr. Wealthy over. “Hurry up.”
      </p>

      <p>
        A few people came over and carried the young man up into the shop and
        then threw him into a small room where Gu Fei normally rested in.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        “I’ve never even slept on this bed,” Li Yan gave a firm
        <em>tsk</em> after everyone walked out. “… yet a random weak bastard
        gets to enjoy it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can rush out right now, fall flat on your face, and I will
        immediately make a bed for you,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>“You’re shameless,” Li Yan retorted.</p>

      <p>“That’s what you are,” Gu Fei gave him a push. “Get out.”</p>

      <p>
        “Hey,” Li Yan refused to budge, then turned his head and whispered.
        “Didn’t he say that you’re not his friend?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei exerted enough strength to make him stumble before closing
        the door. “He’s the one that found Er<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> Miao
        yesterday.”
      </p>

      <p>“He found Er Miao?” Li Yan was rather amazed, “How fated.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei ignored him and sat down behind the counter, playing a game on
        his phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        “He’s quite handsome,” Li Yan said in a low voice and leaned over the
        counter.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei glanced at him, he turned away and stopped talking
        altogether.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao walked over and spread out her hand in front of Gu Fei, hooking
        her fingers repeatedly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just eat. Look at how chubby you’ve gotten in these two months, no one
        wants to play with you anymore.” Gu Fei took out ten kuai from his
        wallet and placed them on her hand. “Your face is all round now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao did not pay attention to him. She bowed her head and placed the
        money in her pocket, then patted the spot a couple of times before she
        went out with the skateboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s her glossy bald head – doesn’t matter if she is fat or not, no one
        is going to play with her.” Li Yan sighed.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Even if her head isn’t bald, no one will play with her.” Gu Fei
        continued to play his game, “She has never had a friend since she was
        little. Who wants to play with a mute?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t say that,” Liu Fan offered some words. “It’s not like she’s
        actually mute, she just doesn’t speak. It’s nothing serious.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ei, what’s going to happen in the future if it continues on like this?”
        Li Yan sighed again, “School is an easy matter – if she doesn’t want to
        go then she doesn’t have to go, but this habit of only speaking to Da
        Fei, later on…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “This world will most likely not be destroyed because of your worries,”
        Gu Fei interrupted him, “Just write a report and apply for a peace
        award.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Li Yan slapped the table as he walked over to Liu Fan, pulled a
        chair and sat down.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        The shop sank into silence. Liu Fan and the others sitting near the
        radiator all had lifeless and drowsy eyes. This kind of situation was a
        bit scary since their threatening faces hung down in defeat, even the
        three people who wanted to come in and shop ended up leaving after only
        lifting up the curtain and looking in.
      </p>

      <p>“You guys,” Gu Fei knocked on the table, “Just leave.”</p>

      <p>“Go where?” Li Yan asked.</p>

      <p>“Go roam around,” Gu Fei simply replied.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t want to go out,” Liu Fan stretched his body, “It’s too cold
        outside and there’s no place to go to.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You guys are scaring away all the people that come in,” Gu Fei said as
        he lit a cigarette and held it in his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll haul in the next person that comes in here for you,” Liu Fan
        started to laugh. “I guarantee that not a single person will escape.”
      </p>

      <p>“Hurry up and get lost,” Gu Fei said. “So annoying.”</p>

      <p>
        “Get lost, get lost, get lost, get lost,” Liu Fan <em>tsk</em>-ed and
        stood up before kicking the others’ chairs. “Your Master Gu<a
          href="#_ftn6"
          >[6]</a
        >
        is going crazy again, he’s going to pick up a knife and cut all down in
        any second now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        A few people were quite unwilling to move, but they still got up,
        whispering and complaining as they wore their coats and walked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Yan followed at the very end. When he was ready to go out, he turned
        around and said: “There’s still another person inside, aren’t you going
        to kick him out, huh?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei did not make a sound as he looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        He did not say anything either as he lifted the curtain and walked out.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        After smoking the cigarette, Gu Fei looked at the time and realized that
        Mr. Wealthy had lied down for nearly twenty minutes already. According
        to the general fainting enthusiast, one should be awake in only a few
        minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        He pushed the door open and looked inside—Mr. Wealthy hadn’t woken up
        yet. His eyes were still closed as he maintained the same position as
        before.
      </p>

      <p>“Hey,” Gu Fei went to push him. “Don’t die here.”</p>

      <p>Mr. Wealthy still did not budge.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei stared at him for a while.</p>

      <p>
        Although Mr. Wealthy’s face was slightly dirty, his handsomeness was
        hard to conceal and the corner of his somewhat droopy eyes seemed
        arrogant, for lack of a better word.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based on his habit of looking at everyone in disdain, Jiang Cheng was
        fairly handsome. It was just that he truly disliked the sarcastic aura
        that exuded from all over his body during their first meeting the day
        before, even if the sarcasm was relatively subtle, he could still sense
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        After staring for a few minutes, he lifted the quilt and fished around
        in Mr. Wealthy’s pocket, pulling out a wallet. His identity card and a
        few other membership cards were clipped together.
      </p>

      <p><em>Jiang Cheng.</em></p>

      <p>
        He put the wallet back, moved in close to the side of Mr. Wealthy’s ear
        and roared: “Hey!!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Mr. Wealthy finally moved. He groaned softly and it sounded quite
        unpleasant.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>Gu Fei kicked the bedside, turned around, and walked out.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng didn’t know what had happened to him.</p>

      <p>
        When he opened his eyes, it was like he had lost his memory.
        <em>Who am I and where am I?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        After a while, the last scene he remembered was the extremely unclean
        ground making direct contact with his face, along with the snow that had
        been trodden on until it became slurry.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>I actually fainted?</em> …<em>
          never did I think that this would happen in my lifetime.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        He sat up, lifted the quilt that was covering his body, and when he
        looked down and saw his completely muddy clothes, he quickly pulled up
        the quilt and looked at it. A few sections were muddied and even after
        he patted a few times, the mud did not fall off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he was thinking about whether or not he should find some water
        to rub it, his senses suddenly came back.
      </p>

      <p><em>Who am I?</em> <em>Jiang Cheng.</em></p>

      <p><em>Where am I? I don’t know.</em></p>

      <p>
        A very small room that was rather clean—a hundredfold cleaner than the
        room that Li Baoguo gave him. He threw the quilt to the side and walked
        through the now open door.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he saw the three rows of shelves outside, Jiang Cheng finally
        realized that he was still in Gu Fei’s shop.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re awake,” Gu Fei glanced at him from the recliner next to the
        checkout counter, then continued to lower his head and play on his cell
        phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng patted the already dried mud on his clothes. “Thank
        you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re welcome,” Gu Fei stared at his phone. “The thing is, it would
        have been troublesome if I didn’t bring you in.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng turned his head to look inside the small room. “That
        quilt is… dirty.”
      </p>

      <p>“There’s a sink in the back,” Gu Fei said. “Just go wash it.”</p>

      <p>
        “What?” Jiang Cheng stared blankly, feeling somewhat angry, but he also
        couldn’t find a suitable opening since there was no fault in Gu Fei’s
        logic.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you don’t want to wash it then why ask.” Gu Fei’s gaze finally left
        the phone and landed on his face.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng didn’t speak and stared straight back at him.</p>

      <p>
        At first, he was very grateful towards Gu Fei for bringing him into the
        room, but Gu Fei’s current attitude also made it difficult for him to be
        grateful. He did not get angry because he wasn’t feeling well after
        having just fainted.
      </p>

      <p>
        After staring for a while, Gu Fei lowered his head and continued to play
        on his phone.
      </p>

      <p>He turned around and walked out.</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        The sun outside was utterly amazing—the only warmth from the northern
        wind—but it was not very effective since it was still cold.
      </p>

      <p>
        His head ached terribly. Jiang Cheng took out a ski cap from his pocket
        and put it on, then fastened the hat from his outer coat over his head.
        He looked at the time; roughly half an hour had passed between him
        fainting and then sleeping, not much time had been wasted.
      </p>

      <p>Even though he did not know what else he could do.　　</p>

      <p>He stood at the curb and looked at either side of the road.</p>

      <p>
        Ultimately, he decided to continue ahead for a stroll just a while
        longer and after he found a fork in the road, he turned back around. 　
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t want to return only to have to listen to Li Baoguo’s snore,
        but he needed to change his clothes.
      </p>

      <p>Stepping on the muddy snow, he suddenly felt a bit lonely.</p>

      <p>
        In the past, there were many days where he also hung around outside like
        this, sometimes not returning home for several consecutive days.
        However, he had never felt lonely as he did now.
      </p>

      <p>And he did not know why.</p>

      <p>
        Perhaps it was because of the strong sense of loss from being abandoned
        and exiled, perhaps it was because of this strange and dilapidated
        environment, perhaps with no friends around, perhaps… it was just
        because of the illness.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        When his phone sounded, Jiang Cheng took it out for a look—a message
        from Yu Xin.
      </p>

      <p>– I regret it.</p>

      <p>He sighed and sent a reply.</p>

      <p>
        – A strong and courageous person is generally decisive in their words.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yu Xin did not reply again, who knew whether she was angry from losing
        face or holding back the fire in the hope of finding a more suitable
        opportunity to explode once more.
      </p>

      <p>
        He placed the phone back in his pocket and then pinched the bridge of
        his nose.
      </p>

      <p>
        He hadn’t paid attention to it before, but now that he felt the intense
        pain overtaking his nose, he reckoned it was from when he fell, and his
        nose kissed the beautiful ground.
      </p>

      <p><em>Tsk.</em></p>

      <p>
        He carefully squeezed his nose from the bridge to the tip, making sure
        that nothing was broken before putting his hands back into his pockets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking a few steps forward, he saw a very small intersection ahead,
        which should be the fork in the road that he was looking for.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before he withdrew his gaze, a green head came flying out from the
        corner of the intersection—blowing like the wind.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng saw that this green-headed person was Gu Miao gliding
        on her skateboard, she had already brushed past him, so fast that he was
        not able to clearly see her face.
      </p>

      <p><em>Skateboard girl ah.</em></p>

      <p>
        He glanced back, thinking that it was unfortunate for such a cool young
        girl to have her hair completely shaven.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Who knows if he’s her real brother or not, but since her hair was cut
          into a mess, is it that difficult to find a hairdresser to just
          shorten it? Do you have to shave it all? It’s the coldest time of the
          year… ah, a green hat too?</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked back once again to see if his vision was blurry or
        not, but Gu Miao had already flown away until only a small black speck
        remained.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before he turned his head back, three bicycles zoomed out of the
        intersection.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bicycles were so beaten that even the metallic structure clanked as
        the wheels turned, but they were still going extremely fast.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck, she fled so fast!” A person on a jingling bicycle shouted.</p>

      <p>
        Once he made out the meaning behind those words, Jiang Cheng was
        stunned… <em>Gu Miao is being bullied again?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        He did not have time to sympathize, he was just feeling inexplicably
        agitated.
      </p>

      <p><em>What kind of fucked up placed is this?!!</em></p>

      <p>
        When he returned to his new “home”, Li Baoguo was still asleep, but he
        wasn’t snoring or wheezing much. However,after Jiang Cheng entered the
        house, he resumed his coughing and kept at it without stopping – the
        coughs seemed to rip apart his heart and lungs.
      </p>

      <p>
        He could not help but look over at Li Baoguo twice, but his eyes were
        still closed, and he was sleeping rather soundly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ability to sleep and cough was not one that Jiang Cheng possessed
        since he would definitely wake up if he coughed while he slept. This was
        probably Li Baoguo’s unique skill.
      </p>

      <p>
        After changing his clothes, Jiang Cheng found a towel from his suitcase
        and wetted it so that he could clean up his dirty outfit.
      </p>

      <p>Afterward, he sat on the bed in a daze.</p>

      <p>He didn’t know what to do.</p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo, who was sleeping next door, no longer coughed, but the
        coughing and wheezing sounded… yet again.
      </p>

      <p>
        He could not describe his feelings. This person was his real father and…
      </p>

      <p>… the same blood flowed in his body.</p>

      <p>
        He was actually born into such a family, and even if he did not meet the
        other members of this family, Li Baoguo was already a huge warning sign
        written out in bold capital letters.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a period of time, he had given himself the chance to avoid thinking
        about this problem. But now that he was sitting there, his eyes were
        filled with the scene of decay, whether he looked inside or outside of
        the house – nothing could be done, there was literally no way to avoid
        it.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        A long time ago, he had discussed adoption with his father and mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        It didn’t matter. Some things are so deeply written in the bones that
        even the care and nurture once kindly given was no match whatsoever.
      </p>

      <p>
        He could not remember clearly how his father and mother had answered him
        back then, he only remembered his own words. Now each and every single
        one of those words was like a firm slap across his own face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Speaking of his younger brother’s personality, it was very similar –
        strict, barely spoke and loved to quietly read books, but he was totally
        different even though he did not talk much either…
      </p>

      <p>
        Even the neighbors had said that they truly did not look like a family.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>That’s right, </em>this was the incompatibility that was written on
        his body.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo suddenly coughed. It was as if he was being severely choked
        and didn’t stop for quite some time to the point that he should be awake
        this time. Jiang Cheng heard him swearing repeatedly. After a while, the
        snoring sounded once again.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng was suddenly overtaken by fear.</p>

      <p>… fear that was sealed with a strong sense of suffocation.</p>

      <p>
        He stood up and went to the living room to get the keys so that he could
        go out and make a copy of them before finding a hospital for a checkup.
        Since his entire body was feeling very uncomfortable, he must have had a
        fever.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was squatting outside the shop near the flowers and shrubs,
        watching Gu Miao speed dazzlingly in front of him for the third time
        with her freezing red face.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fourth time she passed by, Gu Fei waved his hands towards her
        repeatedly. She halted and then turned around before slowly sliding in
        front of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s time to go home to eat.” Gu Fei stood up, “Go put your things away
        properly.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao dragged the skateboard into the shop.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei lit a cigarette and mulled over what to eat for lunchtime.</p>

      <p>
        A minute later, the sound of Gu Miao’s scream came from inside the shop.
      </p>

      <p>He threw the cigarette away, jumped up, and rushed into the shop.</p>

      <p>
        The scream came from the bathroom in the back. He rushed out from the
        back door and pushed the bathroom door open only to see that Gu Miao was
        covering her eyes and was screaming at the sink incessantly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei reached over to turn off the faucet. Then he picked her up and
        piggybacked her out of the bathroom while patting her back lightly.
        “Shhh… calm down. There’s no water, there’s no water…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao’s scream stopped as she hugged his neck and rested on his
        shoulder and then she whispered: “I’m hungry.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m hungry too.” Gu Fei held her hand with one hand and picked up the
        skateboard with the other, “Let’s go eat a feast.”
      </p>

      </p>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei parked his motorcycle in front of the shop and Gu Miao swiftly
        climbed onto the backseat with her skateboard pressed against her chest.
        Then she held onto his waist and put her own face against his back.
      </p>

      <span id="more-5147"></span>

      <p>“Let me see your face,” Gu Fei said as he turned his head around.</p>

      <p>Gu Miao lifted her face for him to look.</p>

      <p>“There’re still some tears, wipe them off,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao used the back of her hands to rub her eyes and then used her
        sleeves to rub under her nose.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>,” Gu Fei let out a sigh. “Even if you were a boy, you would
        still be considered the crude kind ah.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao smiled and stuck her face against his back again.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei rode his motorcycle out, with a clear destination that was
        directed toward the downtown shopping mall. According to Gu Miao, the
        idea of a feast referred specifically to the barbeque buffet located in
        there.
      </p>

      <p>
        This little girl was abnormally persistent on some matters—only willing
        to eat in that one restaurant when they go out was just one of many.
      </p>

      <p>
        The most prominent benefit of living in a small city was perhaps the
        fact that there was only one downtown area. Moreover, it was within
        reach, taking only a short amount of time no matter which area you were
        arriving from. The only thing was, this was also the time of day when
        the restaurant was the busiest. There were basically no available tables
        left when they arrived.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are there any deals today?” Gu Fei asked the waiter. He pulled out his
        phone to search for any possible availability of coupons and then gave
        Gu Miao’s head a flick. “You can go find a table.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Miao put her skateboard on the floor and placed one foot on it,
        Gu Fei immediately placed his foot on it as well. “Walk.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you want the skateboard behind the counter for safe-keeping?” the
        waiter asked while smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao shook her head and quickly bent down to pick up the skateboard
        before she hugged it against her chest.
      </p>

      <p>“She’ll take care of it,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>Gu Miao ran inside with the skateboard in her arms.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck, I’m getting hungry from hearing you talk,” Pan Zhi swallowed some
        saliva. “For real though, I’ll go over and visit you tomorrow, and while
        we’re at it, you can take me out for food. Here… there’s no way we can
        get that much food with that cheap of a price.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did your family help with poverty alleviation over the New Year?” Jiang
        Cheng had his phone wedged between his ear and shoulder, while one hand
        was occupied by a plate and the other by chopsticks as he sluggishly
        picked up pieces of pork belly, sliced beef, pork belly, sliced beef… to
        him, there was actually no point in having a large variety of food since
        he only liked eating these.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How can that be the same,” Pan Zhi said with a rather dejected tone.
        “We had planned to eat barbequed meat together last semester, but now,
        not only did we not get to eat the meat, even the person is gone as
        well.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go stay in a hotel once you get here,” Jiang Cheng put down his
        chopsticks and picked up a plate before he continued to pile on more
        meat. “You also have to book it yourself, I don’t have the energy to do
        anything right now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m fine with staying at your place,” Pan Zhi said matter-of-factly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No you can’t,” Jiang Cheng knitted his eyebrows. <em>He</em> doesn’t
        even wish to stay any longer in the room he was currently living in.
        “Book a standard room, I’ll go over.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… is the relationship between that biological father of yours not going
        well?” Pan Zhi contemplated.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No relationship has been established yet,” Jiang Cheng said casually as
        he carried two full plates of meat and walked over to grab a bottle of
        beer. “It’s neither good nor bad…”
      </p>

      <p>When he walked back to his table, he froze.</p>

      <p>
        For a table of four, one chair was occupied by a skateboard, another sat
        a little bald-headed person wearing a blue jacket, and on the table was
        a… knitted green hat with little pink flowers on.
      </p>

      <p>“Gu Miao?” Jiang Cheng looked at her in surprise.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao nodded, seemingly not too astonished. She then brought her
        skateboard down from the chair and settled it under the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You…” He put the plate that was in his hands down on the table and
        noticed that Gu Miao was already staring anticipatingly at the barbeque
        plate. He waved his hand back and forth in front of her eyes, “Who are
        you here with?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao stood up, pointed towards the entrance, and waved her hands a
        few times.
      </p>

      <p>When Jiang Cheng looked over, he saw the equally astonished Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        “Let’s find another table,” Gu Fei walked over. “This table here has
        already been taken by this Gege<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao looked around, swallowed some saliva, but didn’t move from where
        she sat.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The waiter told me there were some tables left on the other end,” Gu
        Fei pointed inside. “Let’s go over there.”
      </p>

      <p>
        But Gu Miao still didn’t move. She looked up to meet his gaze with no
        expression whatsoever. Jiang Cheng was unsure of what she wanted to
        express.
      </p>

      <p>
        After being left in a deadlock, Gu Fei turned to look at Jiang Cheng
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Jiang Cheng also looked back at him.</p>

      <p>“You’re by yourself?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng gave a sound in response and sat down.</p>

      <p>
        The waiter walked over and opened the grill, spread a piece of paper
        over it and started putting meat in while also getting ready to brush on
        the seasonings and sauce.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then, we…” Gu Fei was seemingly hesitant, and paused for a long time
        before he finished the sentence. “… can eat together?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng lifted his eyes to glance at him. To be honest, he really
        wanted to respond with, “In your dreams! Go wash the quilt.”
      </p>

      <p>
        But the big eyes on Gu Miao’s bald head were also staring intently back
        at him from across, and it became difficult for the phrase to escape his
        mouth. After the meat was brushed with some sauce, he finally nodded his
        head.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Thanks,” Gu Fei said, and pointed at Gu Miao. “Sit here and wait for
        me, I’ll go get food.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao nodded. 　　</p>

      <p>
        As Gu Fei left,Jiang Cheng laid down two more slices of sliced beef on
        the waxed paper and asked Gu Miao: “Which do you want to eat between
        pork belly and sliced beef?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao pointed at the sliced beef.</p>

      <p>
        “The pork belly is also tasty, grilled them until they sizzle with oil…
        I can eat five, six plates,” Jiang Cheng flipped the meat and brushed on
        some oil. “Do you eat spicy food?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao shook her head.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng put a well-finished slice of beef onto her plate and said:
        “Have a bite.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao was slightly hesitant as she turned her head and glanced in Gu
        Fei’s direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s okay…” Jiang Cheng didn’t get a chance to finish when he noticed a
        visible scar on the back of Gu Miao’s head, estimated to be around five
        centimeters in length. He was somewhat startled.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Miao couldn’t find Gu Fei, she turned back and stuffed the slice
        of beef into her mouth then looked up and smiled at him.
      </p>

      <p>“Wanna try a piece of pork belly?” Jiang Cheng asked her.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao nodded again. He then picked up a slice of pork belly and put it
        in her plate while smoothly picking up the hat that was on the table and
        laying it on the chair next to him. Unable to contain himself, he
        <em>tsk-</em>ed and asked: “Who bought you this hat, huh?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao lowered her head and continued to eat without uttering a word.
      </p>

      <p>To remain silent when eating.</p>

      <p>
        This little girl, out of everyone that he knew, was the one person who
        conducted this fact to perfection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei returned quickly with food, but his ability to pile food was
        significantly inferior to him—at his first return, he brought back three
        plates. If he hadn’t been on the phone with Pan Zhi just now, getting
        six plates in one trip would not have been a problem and then having a
        bit of fruit in the end would be about enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        The table of four was pushed up against the wall. Gu Miao sat on the
        opposite side toward the outside savoring the meal, while Jiang Cheng
        sat on the inside grilling meat with Gu Fei, who hesitantly sat in the
        seat next to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was quite unwilling to pick up Gu Fei’s portion to help him
        grill it. He stretched out his hand and lightly flicked Gu Miao’s head:
        “Go pick out a beverage if you want to drink.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Miao stood up and walked towards the beverage counter, Gu Fei
        swiftly got up and sat down in the seat across from Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng gave him a look, then continued grilling the pork and beef.
      </p>

      <p>“You’re eating so much grease when you have a fever?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En?” Jiang Cheng’s movements stopped briefly as he watched Gu Fei grill
        some glutinous rice cake. “You knew?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You were burning hot when I dragged you in, how could I not know,” Gu
        Fei answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Dragged?” Jiang Cheng’s imagination wondered uncontrollably to a
        scenario of Gu Fei dragging him into the shop by the hair like a sack of
        burlap bag.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Should I have carried you in my arms otherwise?” Gu Fei then put in two
        more slices of bacon as the two shared half of the grill each, creating
        a harmonious atmosphere.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was unsure of how to proceed with the conversation, so he
        stuffed a slice of pork into his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        On her way back from getting the beverages, Gu Miao also brought several
        cups with her. She placed the bottles of beer down one by one —four
        bottles— which were already open. There was even a cup of orange juice.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Well, you’re quite capable,” Jiang Cheng looked at her in amazement.
        “You didn’t spill any onto the floor?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao shook her head and returned to her seat. She then pushed a
        bottle of beer and the cup of orange juice in front of Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t…” He was about to let Gu Miao have the orange juice, but just
        as he opened his mouth, he saw Gu Miao had already picked up a bottle of
        beer and was pouring it into her own cup. “You…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao raised the cup and took a big vigorous gulp. She then let out a
        very pleasurable sigh and used the back of her hand to wipe her mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at Gu Fei only to notice that he was completely
        indifferent to Gu Miao’s actions. He didn’t even glance in her direction
        as he busily wrapped a slice of pork belly inside a piece of Chinese
        lettuce.
      </p>

      <p>
        “She drinks alcohol?” Jiang Cheng asked, unable to restrain himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, only when we eat grilled meat,” Gu Fei brought the rolled-up
        lettuce leaf in front of Jiang Cheng. “Otherwise, she doesn’t…”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looked at the leaf roll.</p>

      <p>Without saying anything, Gu Fei simply held it up.</p>

      <p>“… thanks.” He had no choice but to accept and bite into it.</p>

      <p>
        “Doesn’t it feel greasy to eat a full meal of pork belly?” Gu Fei
        questioned.
      </p>

      <p>“It’s not that bad, I quite like it,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei wrapped two more rolls for Jiang Cheng and then asked again:
        “You’re not a local, right? Based on your accent.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No,” Jiang Cheng answered while the acknowledgment of this fact caused
        his heart to suddenly react in frustration. The discontent that he
        forced down with marbled pork and fatted calf was making a great effort
        to resurrect.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s Li Baoguo’s relationship with you?” Gu Fei continued to ask.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was a bit startled – how did Gu Fei know about Li Baoguo?
        But this question was quickly drowned by a rather anxious agitation as
        he flung two slices of meat onto the grill. “What part of this is your
        business?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei lifted his gaze to inspect him before he smiled and kept quiet.
        He picked up a bottle of beer and lightly bumped it against the bottle
        in front of Jiang Cheng. After taking a sip, he continued on to grill
        some more meat.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the first time that Jiang Cheng ate a meal across the table
        from someone who he was basically a stranger to. Not keen on having a
        conversation from the beginning, there was even less to talk about now.
      </p>

      <p>
        From across, Gu Fei looked like he had also lost all interest to
        converse while Gu-<em>xiaomei</em>,<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> who was
        likely a real mute, took sips of the beer and bites of the meat,
        seemingly having quite a cheerful meal.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the silence, Jiang Cheng ate four plates of meat with a swelling
        head. Gu Miao was probably just about done as well after Gu Fei went
        back and forth to pick up some food a couple more times.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Jiang Cheng finished eating, she finally put down her chopsticks,
        then leaned back against the chair and rubbed her tummy.
      </p>

      <p>“Full?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>She nodded her head.</p>

      <p>
        “You eat more than your brother,” Jiang Cheng couldn’t help but
        concluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        “How’d you get here?” Gu Fei also put down his chopsticks. “I’ll give
        you a ride later, we’re going in the same direction anyway.”
      </p>

      <p>“On the motorcycle?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>“Drunk driving and overloading?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t utter a sound and simply stared at him for a long time
        with eyes filled with mockery of some sorts or others of who knows what.
        In the end, he patted Gu Miao on the shoulder: “Let’s go.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After Gu Fei left with Gu Miao, Jiang Cheng stood up and brought back
        another half a plate of meat and a little basket of lettuce leaves. The
        pork in lettuce wraps that Gu Fei previously made for him was actually
        quite good—refreshing and non-greasy.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he finished the half-plate of meat as well, he felt as though he
        should walk back as to help digest the food.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, it was way too cold outside. He shrunk behind the leather
        curtains and took out his phone, wanting to call a taxi. But even after
        five minutes passed, no one picked up the order.
      </p>

      <p>Pan Zhi called back again instead.</p>

      <p>
        “This ticket has two stations, and the times are different too. Which
        station should I purchase?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “East Station,” Jiang Cheng said. “I only recognize the East Station.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Great,” Pan Zhi said. “Come and pick me up tomorrow afternoon at four
        and send me your address later. I’m going to hunt around for a hotel
        nearby.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s probably none,” Jiang Cheng recalled the overall feeling of
        that area—it just didn’t seem like a place that had hotels. “Just
        randomly book one, the entirety of this place isn’t even that big
        anyway.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After he hung up the phone, someone finally picked up his order for a
        taxi. When Jiang Cheng sat into the car, his whole body fell into
        discomfort.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was probably the feeling of not being acclimatized to the new
        environment. Someone who seldom caught colds suddenly turned into a
        dainty, fragile flower from this change in environment. There were no
        signs of getting better after the full morning of struggles, and even
        after eating his most favorite food—the flower was about to wither and
        fall.
      </p>

      <p>He closed his eyes and sighed.</p>

      <p>
        The people that were stuffed inside for New Year all seemed to have come
        out during these past two days; the road was full of cars and the
        drivers drove quite aggressively with one foot on the gas pedal and the
        other accompanying the emergency brake, less than ten minutes passed,
        and Jiang Cheng already felt his stomach churning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though the destination was not that far, the whole course was more
        or less half an hour long. But the moment he saw the intersection to Gu
        Fei’s house, he could not hold it in anymore. Unable to even speak, he
        directly slapped at the door a few times.
      </p>

      <p>“Here?” the driver asked.</p>

      <p>He nodded his head and tapped the door a few more times.</p>

      <p>
        The driver finally stopped the car. Then, as if he was blasted out by a
        fart, he opened the door and jumped out, dashing towards the garbage bin
        on the side of the street before he started to vomit painfully.
      </p>

      <p>
        This scene was so miserable that even Jiang Cheng didn’t have the heart
        to imagine it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Peace finally came after a series of earth-shattering gut cleansing,
        leaving the aftermath of a head that was aching like it was about to
        explode. With his weight supported by a hand on the wall, he searched
        his pockets for a kleenex, but no kleenex turned up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as anger started to rise from the soles of his feet, a small arm
        reached out from the side with a few kleenexes.
      </p>

      <p>
        He grabbed the tissue and wiped his mouth a few times before glancing to
        the side.
      </p>

      <p>There was truly no lack of coincidences in this universe.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao stood right by his side, wearing her green hat. Three steps away
        stood Gu Fei, wearing an amused expression as he waited for an
        entertaining show to play out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Thank you.” Jiang Cheng nodded at Gu Miao. This shameful yet
        inescapable situation where he couldn’t even turn around and leave or
        say, “the fuck are you looking at” felt quite stifling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao reached out and grasped his, pulling forward—possibly wanting to
        support him.
      </p>

      <p>“There’s no need,” Jiang Cheng took out his hand.</p>

      <p>Gu Miao grabbed his hand again, still wanting to support him.</p>

      <p>“Really, it’s not necessary. I’m okay,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        When he was about to take out his hand once more, Gu Miao grasped his
        hand and held on.
      </p>

      <p>“Er Miao…” Gu Fei started to walk over.</p>

      <p>Gu Miao still refused to let go.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was unsure as to how he should communicate with her. With
        all sorts of irritation building up, they caused his temper to rise and
        he forcefully threw Gu Miao’s hand away.
      </p>

      <p>“I said I don’t need help!”</p>

      <p>Gu Miao didn’t move, her hand was still raised mid-air – frozen.</p>

      <p>
        Before Jiang Cheng had a chance to feel a twinge of guilt, he suddenly
        felt his throat tighten. Gu Fei had grasped his collar from behind and
        pulled him back hard enough for him to stumble.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shit…” He turned around and at the same time struck back with his
        elbow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei caught his elbow with his spare hand, and the hand on his collar
        tightened, therefore Jiang Cheng had no choice but to lean intimately
        against Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>Being constricted by the neck made him want to vomit again.</p>

      <p>
        “She really likes you,” Gu Fei said with a lowered voice against his
        ear. “But sometimes, she can’t really understand other people’s
        sentiments. So please, pardon her.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wanted to say, “I fucking lived for 17 years and have never
        seen someone make a request in such a fashion”, but he didn’t have the
        chance to utter that many words. All he could do was force out three
        words between the gaps of his teeth: “… gonna throw up.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei loosened his hand.</p>

      <p>
        He held himself up against the wall and retched a few times, but nothing
        came out.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei passed him a bottle of water, he grabbed it and twisted open
        the cap, taking two gulps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once he recovered, he looked at Gu Miao, “I’m okay, there’s no need for
        help.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao nodded and retreated back to Gu Fei’s side.</p>

      <p>
        “I’m going back.” He threw the half-finished bottle of water in the
        garbage can, turned around and started walking towards the intersection
        up ahead.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck!</em>　　</p>

      <p>
        The moment he opened the door after arriving at Li Baoguo’s, Jiang Cheng
        was able to sniff out the scent of a cooked meal.
      </p>

      <p>Li Baoguo was standing in the kitchen, holding a phone and dialing.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was just about to speak when the phone in his pocket started
        to ring. He took it out and saw that it was Li Baoguo’s number: “You…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo heard his phone ringing and turned his head. Then he shouted
        with a loud voice: “Yo! When’d you get back? I was calling you!”
      </p>

      <p>“Just came in,” Jiang Cheng closed the door. “You… didn’t hear?”</p>

      <p>
        “My hearing isn’t good,” Li Baoguo pointed at his own ear. “I can only
        hear clearly when I have my head tilted towards the sound.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng responded.</p>

      <p>
        “Where did you go?” Li Baoguo entered the kitchen and brought out a pot
        of soup, “I was waiting for you to come back to eat for a while now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I…” Jiang Cheng hesitated for a moment and didn’t bring up the fact
        that he had already eaten at a grilled-meat buffet by himself. “… went
        to the hospital.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You went to the hospital?” Li Baoguo started to immediately make a
        commotion and as he yelled, he stretched his hand over to touch Jiang
        Cheng’s face. “You’re sick? Where do you feel uncomfortable? Fever? Is
        it because of the sudden change in environment?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I took some medication already, it’s not a big deal.” For the sake of
        this meal, Jiang Cheng held himself back from reacting to the black-ish
        yellow hand that exhausted a heavy odor of cigarette smoke, by not
        instantly slapping it away.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let me tell you – if you’re feeling unwell, don’t go to the hospital.
        There’s a community clinic on the street beside our’s, they’re quite
        professional,” Li Baoguo said. “It’s just that the front door is a bit
        caved in and not easily recognized, it’s beside the small supermarket.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng pondered on it, “A small supermarket? The one Gu Fei…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How do you know Gu Fei?” Li Baoguo turned his head and looked at him in
        surprise. “You just arrived and already got along with him?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No,” Jiang Cheng wasn’t in the mood to explain. “I went to the store to
        buy some stuff this morning.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let me tell you,” Li Baoguo’s voice increased in volume. Even though
        his voice was loud on a regular basis, it was even louder now. “Don’t
        drift along with him, that kid is bad news.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh,” Jiang Cheng took off his jacket and threw it into his bedroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo looked at him, probably waiting for him to ask why. But after
        waiting for a while with no other response, he moved closer with a face
        full of narrative.
      </p>

      <p>“You know why I said he’s bad news?”</p>

      <p>
        “Why?” Jiang Cheng was not actually interested in knowing, but he still
        asked to be cooperative.
      </p>

      <p>
        “He murdered his own father!” Li Baoguo said, standing even closer now
        which made his spit spray on half of Jiang Cheng’s face from excitement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng vigorously stood up to dodge it before he wiped his face
        intensely. As he was about to erupt with anger, Li Baoguo’s words
        suddenly registered.
      </p>

      <p>“What? Killed who?”</p>

      <p>
        “His biological father!” Li Baoguo said, semi-shouting, “He drowned his
        own father.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at him quietly only to see Li Baoguo’s expression in
        high spirits—if Jiang Cheng wanted, he could probably use this style of
        gossip to chitchat for the whole afternoon.
      </p>

      <p>Unfortunately, Jiang Cheng didn’t believe his words.</p>

      <p>
        “Does he not have to sit in prison for killing his father?” He sat down
        in the chair beside the table and rubbed the slightly swelling area in
        between his eyebrows.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It happened so many years ago, what prison is there for him to sit in,”
        Li Baoguo sat down too. “Plus, there was no eyewitness.”
      </p>

      <p>“No one saw ah…” Jiang Cheng laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “But everyone knows what the truth is. When the police arrived, his
        father was in the lake and he was on the shore, that expression…” Li
        Baoguo let out a string of <em>tsks</em>, “One look and you’d know he
        did it… go on, eat, see if the dishes are compatible with your taste?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng made no sound, but he picked up a piece of spareribs.</p>

      <p>
        “It was for his Er Miao,” Li Baoguo could probably see that Jiang Cheng
        didn’t believe him and, as if he was trying to emphasize on the
        credibility, he added to the explanation. “Her head was covered in blood
        after her dad smacked her around and she lost the ability to talk since
        then.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah.” Jiang Cheng replied as he took a bite into the spare rib and
        thought back to the ghastly sight of a scar behind Gu Miao’s head.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p class="has-text-align-right">Translate: Sae | Proofread: Anasofia</p>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        When Pan Zhi’s phone call came, Jiang Cheng was still sleeping as if he
        was in hibernation, and it continued to sound for nearly half a day
        before he bewilderedly answered. “… hmm?”
      </p>

      <span id="more-5245"></span>

      <p>
        “Fuck, I just knew this would happen,” Pan Zhi said. “Open your snobby
        eyes and look at what time it is.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Four o’clock?” Jiang Cheng woke up, put the phone in front of his face
        to see the time but his eyes had yet to clear up – a blur, it was.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s three-thirty already!” Pan Zhi said. “I knew you would do
        something like this so I’m calling you in advance.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s still time,” Jiang Cheng sat up. “I will leave in a bit and
        wait for you at the station.”
      </p>

      <p>“Which exit?” Pan Zhi asked.</p>

      <p>
        “There’s only one exit altogether.” Jiang Cheng glanced out of the
        window; through the dirty glass, he could see that the weather was
        pretty good that day – it was dazzling. “I’m hanging up.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Once he put his clothes on and got off the bed, he felt much more
        comfortable. Except for a little sleeplessness, the discomfort that
        overwhelmed his body the day before to the point that he wanted to beat
        the hell out of anyone he could get his hands on was completely gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Calculating the sleeping time, from the afternoon of yesterday until
        now, it had been one whole day. He felt as though he was floating as he
        walked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo was not at home, and he didn’t know where he had gone to
        either.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt that this “home” was rather strange. When his mother
        wanted to withdraw from his adoption, Li Baoguo had run over quite a few
        times, although he did not want to meet him.
      </p>
      <p>
        But now that he was actually here, Li Baoguo no longer pestered again
        and again that he wanted to come to get his son as he had previously
        said back then.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for the legendary older brother and sister, they were nowhere to be
        seen after two days.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was not only uninterested in the new “home”, but there was
        nothing to look forward to. When he opened his eyes every day, he was
        alone in this completely lifeless room that did not make him feel too
        well.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this house was not a two-story building, he thought that it was a
        century-old house. The placed outside, in all respects, was broken down
        and appeared as though it was impossible to live in.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was also why he did not want Pan Zhi to stay here; compared to his
        former room -where it was clean with a piano inside, to say the least.
        Pan Zhi would certainly bawl for two to three days straight.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, even if he did not want him to stay at “home”, the appearance
        of the East Station should be more than enough to make Pan Zhi bawl for
        a good while.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Pan Zhi muttered as he dragged a large suitcase and carried a
        big bag. The moment he saw him, he sighed regrettably, “This place is a
        bit unacceptable to me!”　
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just go back then,” Jiang Cheng pointed at the ticket station. “Hurry
        up and go get a ticket.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “For our brotherhood!” Pan Zhi said. “I came from far away dragging a
        pile of things just to come and see you! Shouldn’t you be moved?!”
      </p>

      <p>“I am so moved,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        Pan Zhi stared at him and then after a good while, he spread his arms
        open. “I really do miss you a bit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Seeing that, Jiang Cheng walked over to hug him. “I didn’t take that
        into consideration.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you know why you only have me as a friend?” Pan Zhi asked as he
        released him.
      </p>

      <p>“I know,” Jiang Cheng nodded. “You’re stupid.”</p>

      <p>
        He had many friends, but they were all the replaceable kinds—merely
        hanging and strolling together here and there. However, a small problem
        would cause a rift and a big one would make them all scatter like birds
        and beasts.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was only Pan Zhi. They had actually met in the third year of
        middle school and were finally placed in the same class in high school,
        and although they had known each other for nearly three years, they were
        still close.
      </p>

      <p>
        The one thing he missed after coming to this small broken-down city was
        Pan Zhi.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shifu<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>, do you know the place?” Pan Zhi asked
        when he got into the taxi.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How can I not know?” the driver said with a smile. “That’s the best
        hotel here.”
      </p>

      <p>“You really know how to pick,” Jiang Cheng glanced at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Is there a need to pick? The room in his house is the most expensive.”
        Pan Zhi fished around in his pocket until he took out a lighter and
        placed it in his hand. “Have a look, do you like it?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at the lighter, it was the style that he liked,
        smooth and without any decoration. There were only two letters engraved
        at the bottom. He looked closer, “What’s engraved on there? Police
        officer?”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>
      </p>

      <p>“J. C. The initials of your name,” Pan Zhi said. “Cool, right?”</p>

      <p>
        “… really cool,” Jiang Cheng put the lighter in his pocket. “How many
        days are you staying?”
      </p>

      <p>“Two days,” Pan Zhi sighed. “School is starting.”</p>

      <p>“What are you sighing for just because school is starting…”</p>

      <p>
        “It’s annoy<em>ingggg,</em> attending class, taking exams, homework,”
        Pan Zhi frowned. “I want to be like you, good at studying anything
        without even trying that hard and still able to enter the top ten
        rankings. If I was like that, I wouldn’t be sighing.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who said that I don’t try hard?” Jiang Cheng narrowed his eyes at him.
        “It’s not like you don’t know it when I stay up reviewing all night.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The key point is that even if I stay up for ten consecutive nights, it
        would still be useless,” Pan Zhi dragged his words and sighed again.
        “Fuck, I know why I miss you so much. When you leave, there’s no one who
        will give me the answers to the exams anymore!”
      </p>

      <p>“Just quit school,” Jiang Cheng put it simply.</p>

      <p>“Some compassion please?” Pan Zhi glared at him.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng laughed without saying anything else.</p>

      <p>
        Pan Zhi was not satisfied with this small city, but with the hotel he
        was. When he entered the room, he checked on the bed, under the bed, the
        bathroom and even the toilet. “Not bad.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s go and eat something,” Jiang Cheng looked at the time.
        “Barbecue?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Pan Zhi opened the suitcase. “I have other gifts for you.”</p>

      <p>“Hmmm?” Jiang Cheng sat on the side of the bed.</p>

      <p>“How about you guess first?” Pan Zhi reached into the suitcase.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at the box and saw small and large boxes of all
        sorts of food, in such a circumstance nothing else could be in there.
      </p>

      <p>“A tin whistle,”<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> he said.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Pan Zhi laughed and took out a long leather case from the bottom
        of the suitcase. “Was it that easy to guess or was there a meeting of
        the minds between the two of us?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It was too easy to guess,” Jiang Cheng accepted the case and took out a
        black whistle for a look. “Very nice.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Susato, D,” Pan Zhi said. “I didn’t buy the wrong one, right? Is it the
        same as your previous one that you had?”
      </p>

      <div class="wordads-ad-wrapper" style="display: inherit">

      <p>“It is,” Jiang Cheng said and casually played a tone. “Thanks.”</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t smash it again. This one is my gift to you <em>ah</em>,” Pan Zhi
        added.
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng put the tin whistle away neatly.</p>

      <p>
        In fact, he did not have a habit of smashing things when he was angry.
        After all, he was also someone who had been educated for more than a
        decade to have “self-control”. He could fight and beat up people, but
        very rarely did he ever smash up things.
      </p>

      <p>
        The last time he smashed the tin whistle was only because he truly had
        nowhere to vent his anger – not like he could go up and fight with his
        father.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        For this evening, he was not going to return ‘home’. He had hesitated on
        whether to send a text message or call Li Baoguo, but in the end,
        calling was the better option. Li Baoguo answered the call after a long
        while: “Hey!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Hearing the movements in the background, it was obvious that he was
        playing mahjong or cards. Jiang Cheng was speechless and didn’t know
        whether his mother was aware of Li Baoguo’s habits, but… maybe that was
        not a big deal compared to having his existence destroy the atmosphere
        of the family.
      </p>

      <p>
        “One of my classmates came to see me. We are staying in a hotel, so I
        won’t be returning tonight,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “A classmate came, huh?” Li Baoguo coughed a few times. “Then just have
        fun with your classmate, what are you calling for? I even thought
        something happened.”
      </p>

      <p>“… I’ll hang up then,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        Without saying anything else, Li Baoguo immediately hung up the call
        first.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This <em>father</em> of yours,” Pan Zhi looked at him. “What kind of
        person is he?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know, smoking, coughing, playing cards.” Jiang Cheng summed it
        all up.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You also smoke, coughing… who hasn’t coughed…” Pan Zhi tried to
        analyze. “Snor…”
      </p>

      <p>“How annoying,” Jiang Cheng interrupted him.</p>

      <p>“Barbeque,” Pan Zhi waved his hand.</p>

      <p>
        Actually, there was nothing special about barbecue, but Pan Zhi found it
        to be immensely satisfying. Jiang Cheng, himself, did not eat as much as
        he did the day before. After all, he was a delicate flower that was
        recovering from a serious illness.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when he came out of the barbeque restaurant, he still felt that he
        was enduring it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You must be in a bad mood,” Pan Zhi said. “The pork belly today was
        pretty good, but you only ate a little bit…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Good eyesight,” Jiang Cheng nodded. Although his mood was not so bad
        that he couldn’t eat anything, he didn’t want Pan Zhi to know that he
        had had a fever and had thrown up the day before.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s walk for a while,” Pan Zhi rubbed his stomach. “Are there any fun
        places here?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No,” Jiang Cheng said, then thought about it and added another
        sentence. “I don’t know.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey, where is your new school?” Pan Zhi suddenly said, “Do you want to
        go and have a look?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Right now?” Jiang Cheng tugged at his own collar and said, “I don’t
        want to.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Tomorrow then. It’s vacation anyways, so no one will be there. We can
        go and see what kind of school it is.” Pan Zhi put his arm on his
        shoulder, “Before you went through the transferring process and such,
        didn’t you go see it?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t you already know whether I went to see it or not?” Jiang Cheng
        was a little annoyed.
      </p>

      <p>“Oh, that’s right. You just came,” Pan Zhi laughed.</p>
      <p>
        The new life and the new environment brought both an anxious heart and a
        tumultuous mindset but Pan Zhi gave him some comfort. In the unknown and
        strange, there was finally a familiar person beside him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not sleep much the entire night. He chatted with Pan
        Zhi, but he honestly couldn’t remember what they were talking about. In
        any case, it was just like when the two chatted at the sports field
        about this and that. It was not important what the topic of their
        conversations was -the important thing was that someone could talk to
        you.
      </p>

      <p>
        As dawn approached, the two were finally only half-conscious, but at
        around eight o’clock they were woken up by the horn of the big trucks
        outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck, isn’t this the city?” Pan Zhi hugged the quilt. “How can such big
        delivery trucks get to the front of the hotel?”
      </p>

      <p>“I don’t know,” Jiang Cheng closed his eyes.</p>

      <p>
        “There’s breakfast service here, do you want it brought up now?” Pan Zhi
        asked him.
      </p>

      <p>“Up to you,” Jiang Cheng said. “Did you sleep?”</p>

      <p>
        “I might have slept,” Pan Zhi said with a smile. “What’s the plan for
        today?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “We can go and look at the school in a bit,” Jiang Cheng said. “Then
        check if there’s anything fun to do here or not, but since it’s the
        middle of winter, I doubt there will be anything to do.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No worries, I’m a person who pays more attention to spiritual
        enjoyment,” Pan Zhi said. “I came here to see you, as long as I get to
        see you, it’s all good.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How about I sleep some more, you can just grab a stool, sit at the side
        and watch me until you have enough.” Jiang Cheng said nonchalantly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey,” Pan Zhi moved closer and stared at him for a moment. “You must
        have not talked much in the last two days?”
      </p>

      <p>“What’s up?” Jiang Cheng yawned.</p>

      <p>
        “Now that I get to see you again, you’ve talked more than before. Have
        you been holding back?” Pan Zhi asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “… maybe,” Jiang Cheng thought.
        <em>Indeed, there was nothing to say and no one to say it to.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        When they looked at the school he was transferred to on the map, it was
        not too far from Li Baoguo’s home. As for what kind of school it was,
        Jiang Cheng had never checked or had been interested in asking about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The procedure to transfer high schools was very troublesome. From the
        moment his mother and father started to chip away at such task with no
        sign of abandoning it, he had basically lost all interest in
        everything—even finding the motivation to fight back about it had ceased
        to exist.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like if something was taken from his body, he became like a pool of
        mud, looking for a suitable marshland to lie in and end it all.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Pan Zhi checked the route, he dragged him to sit on the public
        bus.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did you know, what you see on the bus is the most authentic aura of a
        city,” Pan Zhi said.
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng glanced at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Aren’t these words particularly philosophical?” Pan Zhi asked, somewhat
        pleased with himself.
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng continued to look at him.</p>

      <p>
        Pan Zhi stared at him and he looked back for a while. “Oh, you’re the
        one who said these words.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng shook hands with him.</p>

      <p>
        There were not many people on the bus. Indeed, it was much easier to
        travel around in a small-town city. There was no crowd, no set of hair
        constantly in front of you, no need to squeeze your way on or off the
        bus either.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s a lot more comfortable to sit on this bus than the one back in our
        city,” Pan Zhi said with satisfaction when he got off the bus as he
        looked at the map on his mobile phone. “Si Zhong<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a
        >, go forward 500 meters, turn a corner and we should be there.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I reckon we can’t get in,” Jiang Cheng pulled his own collar up again.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then we can look from the outside and walk around. From now on, the
        majority of your activities will be around here.” Pan Zhi placed the
        phone in front of him and pressed a button.
      </p>

      <p>“What are you doing?” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Taking a photo,” Pan Zhi said. “When Yu Xin found out that I was coming
        here, she cried, yelled, kneeled and begged me to take a recent photo of
        you. From the way I see it, it is very difficult to refuse a girl…”
      </p>

      <p>“She must have given you money,” Jiang Cheng said indifferently.</p>

      <p>“Yes,” Pan Zhi nodded with earnest.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng saw that he was unable to hold back his wicked smile, he
        said: “Shameless.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you two really over? I still think that she is pretty good.” Pan
        Zhi faced him and took two more photos.
      </p>

      <p>“It doesn’t mean anything,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “It is because she’s a girl that makes it meaningless?” Pan Zhi seemed
        to be conducting an interview while he continued to let the phone camera
        face him.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng glanced at him but didn’t speak.</p>

      <p>
        “I think that if you can find a girlfriend, it’s better to find a girl…
        getting a boy requires too much effort and the environment, isn’t that
        good.” Pan Zhi put his phone away, “Don’t be confused by those online
        fujoshi. If those people were to scatter into the real world, they
        wouldn’t be like that.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You must have also held back from talking for a long time,” Jiang Cheng
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Since I haven’t seen you after vacation started, I haven’t said much.”
        Pan Zhi grabbed his chest pitifully, “I held back all the words in my
        chest until they turned from an A-cup into a B-cup.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I will gift you a set of underwear before you go back,” Jiang Cheng
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We’re here.” Pan Zhi pointed ahead, “Si Zhong… the front is quite big,
        bigger than our school anyway.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The school gate was open and when they walked in, the guard only glanced
        at them without saying anything.
      </p>

      <p>“He’s not concerned?” Pan Zhi asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Are you upset that he’s not concerned, huh?” Jiang Cheng looked askance
        at him, “Idiot.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go, let’s take a stroll.” Pan Zhi raised his arms and stretched out his
        body.
      </p>

      <p>“It’s…” Jiang Cheng looked around, “It’s quite big.”</p>

      <p>
        “Indeed. Our school is in the city center, the land is extremely
        expensive in that area. Even if they want to expand, they wouldn’t be
        able to,” Pan Zhi said. “This school is pretty nice, the sports field
        must also be big… let’s go have a look there?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng grunted in approval.</p>

      <p>
        What he and Pan Zhi were probably most concerned about was the sports
        field. Originally, their school had several indoor basketball courts,
        however, the soccer field was cleared out for a soaring school building
        and although they did not play soccer, they still felt resentful.
      </p>

      <p>In contrast, the field here made them felt much more comfortable.</p>

      <p>
        There was a soccer field. To their surprise, there was actually a group
        of people playing soccer on such a cold day.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are two outdoor basketball courts next to it along with a
        volleyball court.
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s an indoor one, do you want to go in and check it out?” Pan Zhi
        jabbed him with his arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The depressing mood that Jiang Cheng had drowned in for the past few
        days had been significantly alleviated because of this campus. Compared
        with Li Baoguo’s home and the street along that area, this spacious
        field made him feel like as though he could finally breathe smoothly and
        happily.
      </p>

      <p>
        He closed his eyes and took in a deep breath and after he exhaled, he
        slapped Pan Zhi’s shoulder. “Let’s go.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The indoor gymnasium was not that big, but the volleyball, badminton and
        basketball court were all there – it was just that they were used
        interchangeably.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were people on both of the basketball courts. When they saw
        someone coming in, they all looked over.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pan Zhi stopped. Jiang Cheng ignored those gazes, put his hands in his
        pocket, and slowly walked to the empty chairs to the side and sat down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since he had not played for a long time, he planned to watch them play
        for enjoyment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The people on the court watched them for a while and then continued to
        play.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is it the school team having a training session?” Pan Zhi sat next to
        him and asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “They shouldn’t be,” Jiang Cheng said, “That’s just the level of
        enthusiasts.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you want to go over there and play?” Pan Zhi asked with a smile.
        “The two of us can cooperate.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stretched his feet out and waved them in front of him, he
        was wearing casual shoes that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ay</em>,” Pan Zhi leaned back and rest his head on his arm. “I
        don’t know when we will be able to play basketball together again.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t change your style, this kind of wording doesn’t suit you,” Jiang
        Cheng said as someone shot a very beautiful three-pointer into the hoop.
        He shouted in a low voice, “Good shot.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The person glanced at him and smiled, cupping one fist in the other hand
        as a sign of respect.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although he didn’t take the field, the feeling of sitting on the
        sidelines with Pan Zhi, watching as the others play gave him a brief
        moment of tranquility – cutting him off from all those annoying
        circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was fine as long as he did not think about the fact that once Pan Zhi
        left the next day, he would once again return to his newfound rustic
        life.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he engrossed himself in watching the people on the court, he did not
        take notice of some more people coming into the field. When the people
        on the court eventually stopped and looked toward the door with an
        indescribably unwell expression, he finally came to his senses.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why do I feel like there’s going to be a show to watch?” Pan Zhi
        narrated in a low voice, somewhat excited.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What…” Jiang Cheng turned his head over for a look only to freeze up.
        “Show?”
      </p>

      <p>One, two, three, four, five, six – in came six people.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt so shocked that his back molar tooth nearly fell off.
      </p>

      <p>
        The four, Bu Shi Hao Niao, behind was the guy that took his money for
        the water, and at the very back was Gu Fei who was wearing a baseball
        cap that concealed the eye-catching musical note on his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng admired himself for his own ability to remember faces. Even
        when his fever made him confused and disoriented, he could still
        memorize those faces.
      </p>

      <p>
        In an unfamiliar city, an unfamiliar school, encountering six strangers
        that he had met all at the same time—it was truly a miracle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt as if he was infected by Pan Zhi. He watched those six
        slowly walking over while the kind of exciting feeling like when one is
        looking forward to the opening of a big show manifested within him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at their appearance, it looked like they were here to play. Gu
        Fei had on sweatpants and basketball shoes and was holding a basketball
        by himself.
      </p>

      <p>“Da Fei?” Someone on the court questioned.</p>

      <p>“Ah,” Gu Fei grunted as an answer.</p>

      <p>“What are you here for?” that person asked.</p>

      <p>
        “To play ball,” Gu Fei said with a very calm tone without a hint of
        unruliness.
      </p>

      <p>
        “… all of you?” that person asked again after hesitating for a moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The old, weak, sick and disabled won’t.” Having said that, Gu Fei took
        off his coat. When he turned around, intending to throw it on the chair
        to the side, he ended up seeing Jiang Cheng sitting there. Suddenly, he
        choked on his saliva and stared at him as he coughed for a long while.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng restrained his ‘wanting to watch a good show but the good
        show ended before it had even started, what a disappointment,’
        expression and simply said: “What a coincidence.”
      </p>

      <p>“Good morning,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“Are you here together?” the person on the court asked.</p>

      <p>“No,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>
        With Gu Fei being in a group of six, three people went to prepare to
        play and the other three came to sit next to Jiang Cheng and Pan Zhi.
      </p>

      <p>
        The person that took the money sat down near Jiang Cheng and stretched
        his hand out to him: “I’m Li Yan.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng,” Jiang Cheng pat his hand and then pointed at Pan Zhi. “My
        friend, Pan Zhi.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you both in Si Zhong?” Li Yan looked them up and down. “I’ve never
        seen either of you before.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Later, yes.” Jiang Cheng didn’t want to explain too much. “Are you all
        in Si Zhong?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The two people behind him laughed, maybe not intentionally, but there
        was a habitually mocking tone to their voices. Li Yan turned back to
        look at them. “Do we look like students?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who knows.” Jiang Cheng was a bit uncomfortable, “It’s not like I have
        a habit of staring at whoever I happen to catch.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Yan’s complexion suddenly became somewhat unpleasant before he turned
        to look at the people on the court and ignored him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The people behind him probably didn’t sense the atmosphere between them
        since someone said: “Da Fei is a second-year.”<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng answered.</p>

      <p><em>Truly a coincidence ah.</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had his arms crossed, legs stretched out far, and was
        feeling a bit unpleasant.
      </p>

      <span id="more-5254"></span>

      <p>
        The skill level of the ones who were previously on the court was so-so.
        If he was wearing basketball shoes, he and Pan Zhi could probably take
        them on 2 to 5 with no problem. But looking at them play was actually
        quite interesting -there was a sense of superiority from watching above,
        as well as pride in the lofty ambitious spirit that got him there.<a
          href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        But as Gu Fei and his two friends walked onto the court, the entire
        atmosphere changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because Gu Fei’s basketball skills were… very good. If this was situated
        in his previous school, Gu Fei would definitely be the kind that bathed
        in the glory of a massive audience of squealing girls during a citywide
        high-school tournament.
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, watching a game like this no longer brought Jiang Cheng a
        sense of superiority.
      </p>

      <p>
        He felt no particular aversion toward Gu Fei, but there were definitely
        no good feelings either. At a time like this, his inner thoughts were
        conflicted between ‘hey, this sucker is quite skilled’ while another
        side of him forcefully corrected this thought; ‘quite skilled my ass,
        he’s just a showoff flower trellis…’<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        “This guy is quite good ah,” Pan Zhi said, without the tiniest bit of
        tacit understanding. “How did you guys meet?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “He’d be quite ordinary if he was in our previous team,” Jiang Cheng
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh, you’re on the basketball team?” Not waiting for Pan Zhi to respond,
        Li Yan opened his mouth from the other side. His tone tinted with
        provocation, “How ‘bout we have someone from the other side sub off and
        you go on?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng turned his head and eyed him: “No.”</p>

      <p>
        “No?” Li Yan was startled, probably thinking that he would delightfully
        accept the challenge, not actually rejecting it so quickly. “Why?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Guess,” Jiang Cheng stood up and started to walk towards the exit of
        the gymnasium.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pan Zhi stretched his back and followed, leaving behind a couple of
        confused people.
      </p>

      <p>　</p>

      <p>
        “You and your nameless anger,” after exiting the gymnasium Pan Zhi
        shrunk his neck. “You have some sort of enmity towards that guy?”
      </p>

      <p>“I’ve only been here for three days,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “That’s true, the time is too short to raise any issues with someone,”
        Pan Zhi sighed. “Everyone is unpleasant to the eye for you right now
        anyhow.”
      </p>

      <p>“You seem okay,” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        Pan Zhi smiled: “Ay, for real though, how do you know that person? From
        second-year?”
      </p>

      <p>“… neighbor” Jiang Cheng answered.</p>

      <p>“In the same building as you?” Pan Zhi asked.</p>

      <p>“From the street adjacent,” Jiang Cheng answered simply.</p>

      <p>“Ah,” Pan Zhi responded.</p>

      <p>
        In truth, he could feet that Pan Zhi found it difficult to grasp this
        concept for the moment. They all grew up in an enclosed housing estate<a
          href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >
        where neighbors came in two types: the ones from the same building unit,
        and the ones from the same housing estate. The previous one was based on
        a relationship with the nod of a head, the latter was based on the sweep
        of an eye.
      </p>

      <p>
        The street adjacent – this sort of neighbor was something they had never
        really come into contact with.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng lightly sighed. There was a false illusion that he was there
        to participate in an episode of “Metamorphosis.”<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is there a mountain here? Let’s go see the snow” Pan Zhi clapped his
        palms together.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Mountain climbing in this cold weather? Are you not afraid that your
        brain will get frozen, it’s not that agile to begin with,” Jiang Cheng
        stated. “And have you never seen snow?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s a lot bigger than the snow we have ah.” Pan Zhi swung his arm over
        his shoulder. “Cheng’er<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>, big brother will take
        you out to get a breath of fresh air. It’s just a change of setting,
        what’s the big deal. It’s just a change of parents, what’s the big… this
        is kind of big, how do I want to word this…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sure, let’s go climb mountains,” Jiang Cheng was amused by him as he
        waved his arm. “Go to hell, what’s the big deal.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After a game on the court, Gu Fei felt that his body was comfortably
        warm and that the drowsiness from these past two days had finally
        vanished. He pulled on his coat and turned around to look back at the
        people on the court whose eyes were filled with joy because he had
        finally decided to leave: “Thanks.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t want to play anymore?” A person asked, probably out of habit.
      </p>

      <p>“Well, how about we have another game?” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>No one uttered a sound; their faces were filled with embarrassment.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei smiled and zipped up his zipper: “Let’s go.”</p>

      <p>
        After walking out of the gymnasium, Liu Fan bounced up and down a few
        times. “How boring, I suggested going to the recreation center and
        renting out a court, but you insisted on coming to your school.”
      </p>

      <p>“How much more interesting do you want it to be?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “What’s the fun in playing ball with a bunch of high schoolers?” Liu Fan
        replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You only graduated from high school two years ago,” Li Yan gave him a
        look.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stuck a middle finger in front of Liu Fan: “If you can win me
        one-on-one, you can say that as freely as you’d like.”
      </p>

      <p>Everyone laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Liu Fan slapped away his hand. “Let’s go eat something, I’m
        hungry.”
      </p>

      <p>“I’m not going,” Gu Fei looked at his phone. “I’m going home.”</p>

      <p>
        “Back to the store?” Li Yan asked. “Isn’t your mom looking after the
        store today?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m taking Er Miao to her physical examination. I went to get the bill
        a few days ago and made an appointment for today,” Gu Fei said. “She
        needs to be coaxed for quite a while when it comes to going to the
        hospital, it wastes time.”
      </p>

      <p>“We’ll go over tonight to hang out for a while,” Liu Fan said.</p>

      <p>“We’ll see,” Gu Fei pulled out his motorcycle keys. “I’m going ah.”</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t you always just leave without a word,” Li Yan said. “Your
        enthusiasm today is quite difficult to get accustomed to.”
      </p>

      <p>“You’re just one to look for trouble.” Gu Fei turned and left.</p>

      <p>
        When life lacked interest, time tends to pass slowly. But even at the
        slightest addition of interest, it passed like the unpreventable flow of
        waterfalls.
      </p>

      <p>
        The little bit of relaxation and joy that Pan Zhi brought with him
        quickly passed away.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you really not going to bring back your pile of food?” Jiang Cheng
        stood in the waiting lounge of the coach station and looked at the
        rolling messages on his phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If I said I will, are you going to return back to the hotel and deliver
        it to me?” Pan Zhi asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t take it seriously, I just had nothing better to say.” Jiang Cheng
        looked at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I brought that food for you to eat since I was afraid you wouldn’t be
        able to find a place to buy them for now,” Pan Zhi sighed. “So, are you
        going back, or should I come again on May 1st?”<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m not going back,” Jiang Cheng said. “I already said I would never go
        back again.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who knows what you’re being so stubborn about,” Pan Zhi said. “Then
        I’ll come over. I’ll bring those guys from class to hang out as well,
        how about it?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “We’ll see when the time comes,” Jiang Cheng leaned against the
        sidewall. “It’s not like we were that familiar with each other anyway.
        After a few months of not seeing one another, it’s doubtful any of them
        will be willing to come. This isn’t some tourist site either.”
      </p>

      <p>“En, then we’ll decide later.” Pan Zhi nodded his head.</p>

      <p>
        The two became silent for a while. Pan Zhi, who was originally sitting,
        suddenly stood up and stared intently into Jiang Cheng’s eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What do you want!” Jiang Cheng was taken aback by his action and
        pointed at him. “Don’t use your mouth! I’ll slap you.”
      </p>

      <p>“Let’s give each other a hug.” Pan Zhi opened his arms.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Jiang Cheng was a bit speechless but still opened his arms and
        embraced him.
      </p>

      <p>“Don’t forget me,” Pan Zhi said. “I’m serious.”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sighed lightly: “Come visit me on May 1st, then I won’t
        forget.”
      </p>

      <p>Pan Zhi smiled: “Okay.”</p>

      <p>
        During the few days before school was about to start, Li Baoguo cooked
        one meal in total – he was not home for all the other mealtimes.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, Jiang Cheng attempted to boil some noodles for himself, but as
        he entered the kitchen and saw a pile of pots, pans, plates and bowls in
        a mess of wild disorder as well as spice jars coated with a layer of
        grease, all of his interest to cook immediately disappeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        For those couple of days, he used the takeout app and ate from every
        restaurant within a kilometer radius that he had an interest in just
        from looking at their names. He ate just like that until the new school
        term finally began.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was quite surprised when his new homeroom teacher called him
        the day before.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your father wasn’t answering his phone,” the homeroom teacher said.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was not too surprising – his hearing wasn’t good, and he was always
        on the gambling table. Jiang Cheng passed by the apartment that Li
        Baoguo played cards in a couple of times, and every time, he could hear
        the noise and excitement upstairs pass through to the ground level.
      </p>

      <p>
        The last name of the homeroom teacher was Xu. Based on the voice, he
        sounded like a middle-aged man with quite the enthusiasm. This allowed
        the slight anxiety that Jiang Cheng felt towards the new surrounding to
        lessen by a few degrees.
      </p>

      <p>
        It started snowing in the morning of school registrations – exactly like
        Pan Zhi said. There was never a chance to see such heavy snowfall
        before.
      </p>

      <p>It actually felt quite exciting.</p>

      <p>
        Upon entering the school gates, he paid attention to the surrounding
        students and felt as though there was not much difference. Equally being
        high school students and likewise numerous unrecognizable faces, but the
        feeling of unfamiliarity and strangeness was exceptionally heightened.
      </p>

      <p>
        He even paid special attention to detect Gu Fei’s face among the
        students, but he wasn’t there.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng, that’s quite a good name.” The homeroom teacher, Uncle Xu,
        was indeed an uncle<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>, and an uncle with a highly
        plausible chance of having drunk alcohol in the morning. “My last name
        is Xu, full name is Xu Qi Cai, your homeroom teacher and I teach you
        guys language. All of your classmates call me Lao Xu or Xu Zong.<a
          href="#_ftn8"
          >[8]</a
        >”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Lao Xu… Zong.” Jiang Cheng bowed slightly in a very well-disciplined
        manner. There was something wrong about those titles that just didn’t
        feel quite right.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s chat first, the first period is language class and after the
        individual review session, I’ll walk you over.” Lao Xu pointed towards
        the chair on the side, “Have a seat.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng sat down.</p>

      <p>
        “Transferring to another school during the sophomore year is quite
        rare,” Lao Xu smiled. “Especially transferring here… I took a glance at
        your previous report cards, your grades are exceptionally good, ah.”
      </p>

      <p>“They’re okay,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>
        “Not just okay, it’s very good. Don’t be so modest,” Lao Xu started to
        laugh but sighed afterward before he very quietly said: “It’s quite a
        shame that you had to transfer here.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng didn’t reply and just looked at Lao Xu.</p>

      <p>
        His previous homeroom teacher had also said, “What a shame, the quality
        of the teaching faculty and origin of the students are lacking…” but now
        Lao Xu was also saying something like that, which took Jiang Cheng by
        surprise.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I see that your score in science is better than your score in
        humanity,” Lao Xu noticed. “Why did you choose to be in a humanities<a
          href="#_ftn9"
          >[9]</a
        >
        class?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng found this question difficult to answer – because both his
        father and mother had hoped that he would choose the science stream. He
        did not let this response that was filled with a crazy, stupid, teenage
        rebellious nature escape his mouth. Even though he had already done it,
        saying it out loud still made him feel that he was extremely idiotic.
      </p>

      <p>
        He hesitated for a while and finally said: “I liked our homeroom
        teacher, he taught humanities.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I see,” Lao Xu was startled. “I hope you will also like me. It would be
        a bit troublesome to transfer to the science stream from here on.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng stared at his face.</p>

      <p>
        After looking at each other in the eyes for a while, Lao Xu began to
        laugh. Jiang Cheng soon followed along and laughed – this homeroom
        teacher was actually quite interesting.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the warning bell for the first period rang, Lao Xu stuck a file
        envelope under his arm, fished out a USB and dropped it in his pocket.
        “Come along, I’ll take you to the classroom.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng swung his schoolbag over his shoulder and followed him
        out of the office.
      </p>

      <p>
        From what Lao Xu was implying, Si Zhong was not exactly a very good
        school. The school campus was quite big, it was just that the building
        layout was a bit unique. The other classes were categorized by grades,
        only the second-year and third-year humanities stream were singled out
        and put into an old, three-story high building with the stairs in the
        middle as the dividing line – on the left were the second-years, on the
        right were the third-years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt as he was close to becoming a fan of fatalism; he could
        even end up in a run-down building after transferring schools. The floor
        was unexpectedly tiled with wooden floorboards… floorboards that were so
        ancient that their natural colors were lost to scratches, which made
        people feel as though stepping on them would make one fall from the
        third floor all the way to the first.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This is an old building,” Lao Xu explained to him. “Don’t look down on
        its age because its design is very logical. The teachers lecturing in
        these classrooms don’t need to use a microphone or raise their voice,
        the students in the last row can hear very clearly.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng nodded his head.</p>

      <p>
        “Our class is on the third floor,” Lao Xu continued. “You can’t see very
        far from this height, but there still is quite a view in the direction
        of the field.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng continued to nod.</p>

      <p>
        “Our school…” Lao Xu continued to talk as he walked. When he glanced
        upwards as he turned on the corner of the stairs, he suddenly shouted:
        “Gu Fei! You’re late again!”
      </p>

      <p>
        This name caused Jiang Cheng’s eyebrows to jump up in surprise
        uncontrollably. He also raised his head towards the top of the stairs
        only to see a person who was sluggishly walking upwards turned their
        head – there was even a bag of milk dangling from their mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even standing against the light, Jiang Cheng could still recognize that
        the person was indeed Gu Fei and not just someone with the same first
        and last name.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Good morning, Xu Zong.” Gu Fei still had the bag of milk inside his
        mouth, which made his speech come out unclear. He swept a glance in
        Jiang Cheng’s direction – probably holding a similar feeling to Jiang
        Cheng -he was already no longer surprised by this form of encounter.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re late and yet still wandering around, why aren’t you climbing
        up?!” Lao Xu pointed at him, “School just started and you’re already
        slacking!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t reply. He instead turned around, took a few large strides
        up the stairs and disappeared down the third-level hallway.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Si Zhong was indeed incomparable to the one that he had previously
        attended. The bell indicating the start of the class had already rung
        and the teachers had also entered the classrooms, yet the hallways were
        still filled with students who had no intention of heading into their
        classrooms. Instead, they simply continued to lean against the banisters
        to chit chat with each other as if nothing happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second-year’s side of the hallway consisted of a heap of lazy and
        scattered students. Jiang Cheng turned to the other side of the hallway
        to look at the third year’s, they were also in the same damn state. He
        paid attention a bit longer but didn’t see Gu Fei who had just come up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu entered the classroom closest to the stairway, Jiang Cheng
        followed suit and peered into the classroom from the doorframe. There
        was a sign that read: Second Year (Class 8).
      </p>

      <p>
        8, not bad, there was finally something that could bring him luck – even
        though he wasn’t quite sure how this 8 could make him wealthy.<a
          href="#_ftn10"
          >[10]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        There were many people standing in the hallway outside of Classroom no.
        8, however, no one budged even after seeing Lao Xu enter the classroom.
        But, when they saw Jiang Cheng walked in, they followed suit, probably
        due to curiosity and hopes of catching a good show.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu stood in front of the podium on top of the small platform and
        looked down at the dozens of people who could not quiet down this entire
        time; he seemed to be patiently waiting for everyone to silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        During this process, Jiang Cheng stood beside the podium and received
        all types of glances and hushed disputes.
      </p>

      <p>
        He felt very uncomfortable. Normally, if someone was to stare at him in
        such manner, he would simply stare back with a “what are you looking
        at”<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a> expression and not cower or let it affect
        him. But with a class of more than a dozen all staring at him
        simultaneously, he felt somewhat at a loss – too many targets would
        result in a loss of targets as all the faces connected into one piece.
      </p>

      <p>
        The God of Irritation tousled in his body, but he restrained the fire
        within and looked over at Lao Xu. Lao Xu was still wearing a tranquil
        expression on his face as he continued to stare at the dozens who were
        incapable of muting themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        He suddenly felt as though the judgment he previously had on this
        homeroom teacher was an error – he was not pleasantly good-natured. He
        ought to be the kind that had no deterrent power over his students and
        tried to never offend anyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        A while later, this circumstance did not show even the tiniest sign of
        coming to an end. Jiang Cheng, who was facing the bitter struggles from
        the verge of exploding, could honestly no longer refrain himself. He
        asked: “Are we waiting for them to all be quiet?”
      </p>

      <p>Lao Xu turned his head to look at him.</p>

      <p>
        And at that exact moment, the dozens of people, who were buzzing like
        the devil had whispered in their ears, completely calmed down all at
        once.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once Jiang Cheng’s anger surfaced, it was difficult to control. He
        normally tried to suppress it before the fire reached its pinnacle, but
        if it couldn’t be contained then ‘who gives a fuck’.
      </p>

      <p>
        To him, having to stand there like an idiot for at least three minutes,
        while being stared at and widely discussed by numerous people, was
        virtually the same nature as having a bag of explosive igniting between
        his two legs.
      </p>

      <p>The dick had already exploded, <em>the world is without me.</em></p>

      <p>
        “Okay, let me introduce…” Lao Xu clasped his palms together and smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng, transferred over,” Jiang Cheng interrupted his speech in a
        calm voice. “Can I sit down now?”
      </p>

      <p>Lao Xu was taken aback for a moment.</p>

      <p>
        When someone in the classroom whistled, the class immediately erupted
        into a moment of chaos that mingled with a few loud voices: “Quite a
        badass ah!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then why don’t you have a seat. You can sit over…” Lao Xu looked to the
        last few rows. “Over there, Gu Fei, raise your hand.”
      </p>

      <p>
        From the first row to the very last row, one head after another all
        turned to the back as if they were playing a game of ‘hot potatoes
        pass-it-on’. Jiang Cheng’s eyes followed down the same path until…
      </p>

      <p>
        He saw Gu Fei, who was sitting in the very last row with a foot on the
        edge of the open front school deskand half a fried bread stick still in
        his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng suddenly felt a strong, powerful force shouting throughout
        his body, encouraging him to write a novel titled: “The Trickster
        King——Every Coincidence in This World Belongs to Me.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei raised his hand in a very perfunctory manner.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng also sat in the last row in his previous school, every week
        the class would cycle through a seat change to ensure everyone had a
        chance to sit in the front row. Except, he would always exchange his
        chance in the front to sit in the back every time.
      </p>

      <p>
        He liked the back rows – quiet, undisturbed and effortless to both
        sleeping and sneaking out the back door.
      </p>

      <p>Yet this particular back row did not make him very comfortable.</p>

      <p>
        The tables and chairs were not aligned, the area was small also, his
        back was almost stuck to the wall, and not a single person was quiet.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were people talking nonstop, playing on their phones, and someone
        was also sitting beside him calmly eating his fried breadstick.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was a bit dumbfounded. Although, aside from his grades,
        there was not a single thing that made him likable to the teachers at
        his previous school, nonetheless, he did attend a school that was able
        to compete with other model high schools in enrollment rates and key
        rates. This sort of class atmosphere that was as if one was simply
        drinking tea and chatting, he had for sure never experienced.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took out his textbook. As he flipped open the pages and got ready to
        listen to what Lao Xu had to teach, he could feel himself being watched
        like a psychopath in the eyes of the people sitting around him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t actually talk with anyone; he didn’t sleep either. He
        simply lowered his head and pulled out a pair of earphones, stuffed them
        into his ears and started listening to music.
      </p>

      <p>
        A boy from the desk in front started to bump their desk in the back,
        every bump was accompanied by a turn of the head and a call: “Da Fei.”
      </p>

      <p>The desk wobbled.</p>

      <p>“Da Fei.”</p>

      <p>The desk wobbled again.</p>

      <p>“Hey, Da Fei.”</p>

      <p>The desk wobbled a third time.</p>

      <p>“Da Fei?”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared intently at the words in the book and debated between
        the choice of slapping the guy on the head with his palm or slapping the
        guy on the head with his textbook, in the end, he reached out and pulled
        out the earphone in Gu Fei’s ear.
      </p>

      <p>When Gu Fei looked at him, he stared back without saying a word.</p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei, hey, Da Fei.” The person in the front bumped the desk again.
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei uttered a reply and continued to stare at Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng also met his gaze in an indifferent, matter-of-fact manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Lend me your camera for use. I’ll return it to you tomorrow,” the guy
        in the front said.
      </p>

      <p>“No,” Gu Fei turned away his face.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck, don’t be stingy ah. I just want to take a few random photos,” the
        person said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck off,” Gu Fei simply finished off the conversation, stuck the
        earphone back in his ear and continued listening to his music.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just for one night,” the person bumped the desk again. “I’ll return it
        to you tomorrow morning.”
      </p>

      <p>The desk shook.</p>

      <p>
        “God damn it. Da Fei, Da Fei…” the person continued to bump the desk.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng could not understand why this conversation had to be carried
        out during the duration of class. Why it had to be carried-out by
        bumping at the desk, why the person was so persistent even after being
        rejected, and he also could not understand why Gu Fei was unwilling to
        lend a camera, why his attitude was so arrogant, and why he was able to
        endure the state of his desk falling into a course of epileptic seizure.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that, he raised his foot and harshly kicked the chair of the person
        sitting in front.
      </p>

      <p>The sound was quite loud, and a <em>bang </em>reverberated.</p>

      <p>
        The person violently crashed onto his desk from the force of the kick.
      </p>

      <p>“The fuck?” The person turned his head around fiercely.</p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, the students around them turned their gazes in the direction
        of the loud bang.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Can you please not bump the desk,” Jiang Cheng looked at him and said
        in a placid tone. “Thank you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The person probably hadn’t returned to his senses when he opened his
        mouth, but no words came out.
      </p>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p data-adtags-visited="true"></p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Gu Fei’s brow rose as he took out his earphones, tilting his head to the
        side to look at Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        <em
          >This guy is actually pretty difficult to deal with. Since he’s in a

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        He looked with great interest at the person in front of him, Zhou Jing,
        who was in complete shock with his mouth still wide open. If he had not
        eaten his egg already, he would have certainly shoved it in his mouth.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        However, Jiang Cheng’s kick just now was considered enough to provoke
        someone. Zhou Jing was an annoying teenager with a bad temper and easy
        to rub the wrong way. If that kick had landed elsewhere… Gu Fei’s gaze
        swept to the right, <em>then there should be a fight.</em>
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “What happened? What’s going on?” Lao Xu patted his desk. “We’re in
        class, we’re in class. Gu Fei, what are you doing?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Gu Fei was taken aback. He used a finger to point at himself and his
        lips made a circular shape, “Me?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Isn’t it you!” Lao Xu said. “You must be bored out of your mind now
        that you’re done eating your breakfast!”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        When the students in the surrounding tables burst out into a peal of
        laughter, Gu Fei could not help it and also laughed, twisting his head
        to look at Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “What are you looking at him for?” Lao Xu pointed at him. “His grades
        will leave you all in the dust!!”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Oh——” the entire class suddenly shouted.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">“Xue——ba——”</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Lao Xu has a key target to cultivate now ahhh——”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Gu Fei sighed,
        <em
          >Lao Xu, this intelligence of yours makes it look like you’re an
          innocent internship teacher who has never taught a chaotic class
          before. With just this one sentence, you have segregated Jiang Cheng
          from the rest of the class with a three-foot threshold.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng looked at Lao Xu and wholeheartedly suspected that this
        person was a mole sent by his mother to torture him in any possible way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although he was not afraid of any kinds of provocations and he had not
        suppressed his temper since he had entered until that moment, he did not
        want to be praised about his grades by the homeroom teacher in a class
        where the word ‘chaotic’ could be easily seen with just a glance.
      </p>

      <p>
        ‘Xueba”, these two words combined to one were simply a type of ridicule.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s enough,” Lao Xu cleared his throat. “Let’s continue with class…
        where were we…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Before, Jiang Cheng was already not listening to what Lao Xu was
        lecturing about and now, he didn’t feel like listening even more. He
        simply lied on his desk and took out his cellphone.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the past, he was like a thief when he sneaked to play with his phone
        in class; the ringtone and media both needed to be muted before he
        plugged the earphones and quietly slid the wire through the sleeves of
        his shirt and put it in his ear.
      </p>

      <p>
        The homeroom teacher’s drawer was filled with a pile of confiscated
        cellphones, making it look just like a secondhand cellphone stall in the
        street.
      </p>

      <p>
        Si Zhong was different. When Jiang Cheng’s gaze swept toward Gu Fei, he
        saw that his cellphone was already on the desk with a stand propping it
        up, and he obviously had earphones on as he hugged his arms and leaned
        back into the chair to watch the video.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng rested his upper body on the desk. Lao Xu lectured as if he
        was chanting a Buddhist scripture and the ongoing chatters around him
        were no different. This never-ending chanting attacked him from all
        corners, making him dizzy and muddle-headed for half of the class – it
        was truly boring. He looked at his phone and sent Pan Zhi a message.
      </p>

      <p>– Grandson.</p>

      <p>Pan Zhi replied immediately.</p>

      <p>– Grandpa, what class are you in? Do you have time?</p>

      <p>– Language and Literature, you?</p>

      <p>
        – English, Lao Lv suddenly attacked us with a surprise test. I’m so
        dead.
      </p>

      <p>– It’s not a formal exam, what is there to be dead about?</p>

      <p>
        – I can’t even answer any of the questions. Lao Lv said something about
        digging deep and finding out the truth. I think he has a hidden agenda!
      </p>

      <p>
        That message from Pan Zhi had an image attached to it. Jiang Cheng
        merely glanced at it and sighed, this was a page of multiple-choice
        questions and the angle of the image was just plain cunning. With one
        look, one could tell that this photo was secretly taken under the risk
        of saying goodbye to his cellphone for the whole summer.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked at the time and enlarged the image, then he looked at the
        questions and quickly started to write the answers on his notebook. Just
        as he had written two questions, Pan Zhi sent three more images in rapid
        succession. He glanced at them, somewhat speechless. Fuck, wasn’t he
        just sending all the multiple-choice questions on the test paper…
      </p>

      <p>– Wait.</p>

      <p>
        After he sent Pan Zhi that one-word reply, he continued to look at the
        questions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, these were not considered to be hard questions since the
        answers could more or less be guessed. He did not know why Pan Zhi
        couldn’t even write out an answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the surrounding still quite noisy, Jiang Cheng couldn’t help but
        admire Lao Xu’s endurability. Perhaps for a teacher who was already
        accustomed to teaching a chaotic class, his endurability was just
        naturally strong.
      </p>

      <p>
        He still remembered that in his first year of high school, the chemistry
        teacher did not have a strong appeal. When someone chatted during class,
        her voice was ordinary compared to the one that he was listening to now;
        truthfully, Lao Xu’s would have made her cry out of anger. If she was
        switched to this class, she would definitely bawl her eyes out until she
        became a transparent glass wallflower.
      </p>

      <p>Look at how awesome this Lao Xu was.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wrote out the answers while glancing up at Lao Xu, he was
        permissive towards people napping and chit-chatting. As long as you
        didn’t stand up and start dancing around the room, he didn’t even bother
        to stop his lesson.
      </p>

      <p><em>Tsk, tsk, tsk.</em></p>

      <p>
        Since Pan Zhi only sent multiple-choice questions, it didn’t take long
        for him to finish. Then, as he inputted the answers into their chatroom
        and sent them to Pan Zhi, he looked at the time. There were still a few
        minutes left before class ended, enough for him to copy the answers.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for the other questions… Pan Zhi had always been too lazy to write,
        and sometimes, even too lazy to copy.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he sent the message, he senselessly opened the -Moments-<a
          href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >
        section of his WeChat and slowly scrolled down only to see Jiang Yijun…
        his beloved younger brother had posted a selfie of the family eating
        out; their mother and father were in the background – a family of three,
        joyous and harmonious. He suddenly felt suffocated, followed by a
        strange reaction of wanting to vomit.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he blocked the family of three, he put his phone back into his
        pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just when he was about to look up, something fell on his head and before
        he could react, another one came; it was like a stone had been thrown on
        his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Immediately after, he saw a field of white dust and also smelled
        drywall.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck?” He was somewhat shocked as he looked up. There was a large
        piece of white drywall on his desk, along with various large and small
        broken pieces.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t care much about it. His first reaction was to pat his
        head and then glance over at Gu Fei’s head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s phone was still on the desk, but whatever he was playing on the
        screen could no longer be seen. There was a layer of dust on his face
        and head, covering it completely in white, but even then, he maintained
        his previous posture of holding his arms together.
      </p>

      <p>The only thing was that his complexion was a bit unsightly.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked up at the ceiling only to see that the piece of
        drywall over their head had disappeared; obviously, it was all on their
        body and desk, exposing the wooden structure…
        <em>indeed an old building ah</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        When his sight returned to the desk, he saw a small black stone at the
        corner that should not be part of the drywall.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just then, the bell to dismiss the class rang and Lao Xu closed the
        textbook. “Alright, the class is over… what… the drywall fell down
        again? Who is on duty today? Sweep it up.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The second Lao Xu left, an uproar suddenly burst inside the room as
        everyone swung their heads to look at the last row.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment, Jiang Cheng quickly determined that with the small
        stone, Gu Fei’s gloomy expression and the people who all stood up and
        looked back as soon as the bell rang with faces that read ‘a good show
        is about to start’… the drywall would ordinarily fall down on its own,
        but this time, it certainly did not fall on its own.
      </p>

      <p>
        He sat still without moving, took out a napkin from his bag and slowly
        wiped the white dust on his desk to the floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this kind of circumstance that lacked purposes, it was actually quite
        easy for him to control his own anger.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei pushed his desk and stood up, took off his jacket and shook it a
        few times before he looked up at Wang Xu.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei, I’m sorry.” Wang Xu had already gotten up, placed an arm on his
        shoulder and casually patted his jacket. “Go, let’s go to the snack
        counter. I’ll get a drink for you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei shook off his arm, wore his jacket and left through the back door
        of the classroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu quickly followed and walked alongside him down the stairs. “Hey,
        Da Fei, it was really an accident.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei merely grunted. He did not feel like saying much to Wang Xu
        and having a head full of dust had definitely put him in a bad mood,
        especially when his eyes had only cleared up.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I just wanted to fucking start with a bang<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> and
        show that bastard what’s up,” Wang Xu said. “For a transfer student to
        act so fucking arrogant on the first day, if we don’t put him in his
        place, he won’t know that each place has its own rules!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t say anything and immediately turned left after going down
        the first floor.
      </p>

      <p>“Hey, the snack counter,” Wang Xu said, “Where are you going?”</p>

      <p>“To pee,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “You’re going all the way over to the teacher’s washroom just to pee?
        That’s too far,” Wang Xu retorted.
      </p>

      <p>“Fewer people,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        “Why be so particular just to pee… then I’ll just get you a milk tea,”
        Wang Xu said. “Is Assam milk tea okay?”
      </p>

      <p>“Drink it yourself,” Gu Fei leaned to the side and spoke.</p>

      <p>“Then Assam it is!” Wang Xu exclaimed.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei sighed.</p>

      <p>
        The washroom near the sports field was close to the teacher’s office,
        which inadvertently caused the students to normally not want to come
        here. In truth, not many teachers used it either as all the office
        buildings already had a washroom, so this area was quite peaceful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took a stick of cigarette out of his pocket and walked in while
        lighting it, but just as he inhaled the door to the side opened and Lao
        Xu walked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Xu Zong,” Gu Fei said unclearly with the cigarette hanging loosely in
        his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You just have to smoke in the teacher’s washroom, what kind of a
        problem is this!” Lao Xu kept his voice down as he pointed at him, “Are
        you putting on a show of power ah! Who are you showing off to?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What power can I show by smoking?” Gu Fei laughed as he stood in front
        of a urinal. “I come at you with power, are you scared of me?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll admire you.” Lao Xu walked over and pointed at his cigarette, “Put
        it out!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei sighed, put the cigarette butt in the squat toilet behind him and
        then pulled down his zipper and looked at Lao Xu. “I need to pee,
        <em>now</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>Lao Xu sighed and turned to walk out of the toilet.</p>

      <p>
        Just as Gu Fei pulled open the zipper area and started to pee, he
        suddenly stopped and said: “That Jiang Cheng…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the distance was somewhat far, Lao Xu’s voice was very loud and
        resonated with grandeur in the toilet.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck…” Gu Fei propped up on the wall. He was actually startled by Lao
        Xu’s voice and nearly peed on his shoes. “Xu Zong, can you wait a
        moment!”
      </p>

      <p>Lao Xu walked out.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei zipped up, lit another cigarette, went into a random squat
        toilet, closed the door and smoked in there.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was another important reason why he wanted to come here aside from
        the peacefulness, and that was that the toilet here smelled less.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu was, in fact, a very earnest teacher beneath the surface.
        Unfortunately, it didn’t show in class and no one was willing to listen
        to him. A homeroom teacher with an EQ that wouldn’t add up to more than
        half a tael<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> even with added water to the weight,
        so no matter how much energy he put into teaching his students, no one
        would buy it.
      </p>

      <p>Sometimes, Gu Fei was tired for him.</p>

      <p>
        After he walked out, Lao Xu was standing in wait for him on the
        snow-covered ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why don’t you just find him another seat,” Gu Fei said as he pulled his
        collar neatly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is it because you don’t want to be his deskmate? Or you don’t want to
        have a deskmate?” Lao Xu looked at him, “Gu Fei ah, it’s not good for
        you to always be so unsociable.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t analyze me,” Gu Fei said, “You’ve analyzed for two years and have
        never gotten it right even once.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s just get along again, it’s only the first day.” Lao Xu laughed,
        “This Jiang Cheng… his grades are indeed pretty good, so having him as a
        deskmate can also have a good influence on you.”
      </p>

      <p><em>Pretty good grades? Good influence?</em></p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei recalled how Jiang Cheng leaning over his desk to play on
        his phone during the whole class, he found Lao Xu’s conclusion of
        ‘pretty good grades’ extremely hard to accept.
      </p>

      <p>“I have to go to class,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Return to the classroom,” Lao Xu said, “Learn to get along, get along.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei was on his way back to class, he ran into Wang Xu on the
        third-floor stairway who passed him the Assam milk tea.
      </p>

      <p>“Thanks,” Gu Fei took the milk tea and went inside the classroom.</p>

      <p>
        The second class for that day was English and the teacher had a pressing
        temperament and loud windpipe. Although he didn’t have any prestige with
        the students, just like Lao Xu, he could repeatedly scold or yell in a
        pattern that was many and varied—once he scolded, it would last half an
        hour in all different manners. Moreover, he had also fought with the
        students and was brave enough to withstand every difficult person
        without cowering in the least. Hence, ordinarily, if there was no
        particular matter to be fired up about, they would not provoke him and
        once the bell rang, they would simply enter the class.
      </p>

      <p>
        The desk was already put in order, and it did not seem like Jiang Cheng
        was the only one who had cleaned since when Gu Fei came over, he
        happened to see Yi Jing walking away with a cleaning rag.
      </p>

      <p>“Thanks,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “It’s nothing,” Yi Jing said as she combed through her hair and smiled.
        “I’m on duty today.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei sat in his own seat and glanced at Jiang Cheng, who sitting
        rather quietly, leaning back into the chair looking at the blackboard
        ahead.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took out his phone and prepared to continue watching the movie that
        he did not finish from before.
      </p>

      <p>Just as the video started, Jiang Cheng suddenly stood up.</p>

      <p>
        Not only that, he had easily grabbed his chair while his other hand held
        a long broom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was stunned and quickly glanced over at Wang Xu. Wang Xu had just
        sat down and was happily chatting with his deskmate.
      </p>

      <p>He frowned, <em>is he going to strike directly?</em></p>

      <p>
        This person was Wang Xu, and aside from Gu Fei, this was the second name
        that Jiang Cheng remembered in the class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu’s seat was separated from his seat by a desk. The desks and
        chairs in the classroom were arranged inseparably close and dragging a
        metal chair over to Wang Xu would require him to bypass the teacher’s
        desk, which was slightly troublesome.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus, he put down the chair and said to the two people in the chair next
        to him: “Move.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Although the two looked at him inexplicably, they still stood up and let
        him squeeze through from the back.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he went through, he casually dragged one of their chairs over.
      </p>

      <p>“Hey! What are you doing?!” that person shouted.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng turned to look at him and that person stared at him for a
        mere two second then went completely silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that, the whole class looked over, and knowing that he was being
        confronted, Wang Xu stood up very arrogantly. “Oh, you want to smash my
        head? Come, come, come, the xueba wants to give everyone a surprise…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not say anything as he grabbed the chair and placed it
        next to Wang Xu’s seat with a <em>clang</em> and slowly stepped back a
        few steps. Then he raised his hand that was holding the long broom up
        and let it fly toward the ceiling like a javelin, accurately jabbing the
        ceiling above Wang Xu’s head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu had already reacted when Jiang Cheng raised his hand, but when
        he turned to leave his seat, he was blocked by the chair that was placed
        to the side of his leg. Just as he wanted to kick the chair and make his
        way out, the broom and a large piece of the ceiling drywall had already
        smashed down on him.
      </p>

      <p>
        His head and desk were entirely covered in white dust from all around.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a brief silence in the class, a burst of screams and laughter
        sounded at the same time; some people had even stomped their feet on
        their desk as a period of disorder immediately ensued.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the fuck, you bastard!” Wang Xu roared, kicked the chair and
        charged out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not dodge as he stood in the same place and waited for
        him to come. This kind of wide-open posture did not require him to take
        aim, a punch to his nose was enough for blood to gush out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s going on?!” a loud and violent roar suddenly came from the
        classroom door.
      </p>

      <p>
        This roar was probably the most earth-shaking roar that Jiang Cheng had
        ever heard in his life—full of noble aspiration and daringness that
        soared into the sky, scaring him to almost pouncing on Wang Xu.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s going on, what’s going on?” A middle-aged male teacher waving a
        pointer stick rushed over and pointed at Jiang Cheng first. “Which class
        are you from? What are you doing here?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Jiang Cheng could answer, the teacher’s pointer poked Wang Xu’s
        face. “You! Your ears must be hollow! The bell has rung already, did you
        not hear it?! Are you deaf?! Can you hear it clearly now with this voice
        of mine?! Can you?! Can you?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        After that, he also did not wait for Wang Xu to speak either as his
        pointer pointed to everyone else: “You all must be waiting to watch a
        show, right?! How about I put on a show for you?! Just give a round of
        applause! Clap, clap, clap! Come on!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Once that bellow of rage ended, everyone in class quietened down. Wang
        Xu simply stared without any intention to continue to charge over, while
        Jiang Cheng was somewhat worried as he looked up at the ceiling,
        constantly thinking that if this teacher roared only one more time, the
        entire ceiling would surely collapse.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go back to your seats!” the teacher actually roared again, “Waiting for
        someone to carry you?! Who wants to tear the door down? How about I
        carry you all?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        With that, low laughs and groans of complaints sounded in the classroom;
        Jiang Cheng turned to return to his own seat.
      </p>

      <p>“You!” the teacher stopped him, “Which class are you from?”</p>

      <p>“The xueba that just transferred here—” someone said.</p>

      <p>
        The teacher stared at him with amazement as his eyes moved up and down
        for a good while. “Return to your seat! Are you waiting for someone to
        carry you, huh?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was unable to collect himself from his roar; he glanced at
        him and then returned to his seat.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s start class!” the teacher patted his desk with the pointer in his
        hand. “Good morning ah, everyone!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was stunned, the moment that English accent came out, he
        <em>almost</em> couldn’t help it and laugh out loud.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the teacher started class, the person sitting in the desk ahead
        that had bumped his desk before bumped his desk again. But this time, he
        was not looking for Gu Fei and instead turned toward Jiang Cheng. “Hey,
        xueba, you’re pretty awesome, casually provoking Wang Xu like that.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng didn’t speak.</p>

      <p>“Fuck off,” Gu Fei said from the side.</p>

      <p>
        “The fuck?” the person whispered, “It’s not like I’m talking to you. Are
        you used to looking at me and saying that?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei propped his cellphone on the desk.</p>

      <p>
        “You’re going to have some problems,” the person added as he turned to
        glance at the teacher’s desk and then quickly back at Jiang Cheng and
        said in a serious tone: “Wang Xu is definitely not finished with you.
        Our school has a back door, you kno…”
      </p>

      <p>“What’s your name?” Jiang Cheng interrupted.</p>

      <p>“Zhou Jing,” he said.</p>

      <p>
        “Thanks,” Jiang Cheng, pointing at his chair. “Don’t. Bump. The. Desk.
        Again.”
      </p>

      <p>“… oh.” Zhou Jing was shocked as he nodded.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng opened his textbook, looked down and fixed his gaze on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zhou Jing’s face went stiff for a while before eventually turning to
        face ahead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng thought that the beginning of the new semester was unusually
        wonderful for him, it was truly a pity that he did not have a habit of
        writing in a diary in normal times.
      </p>

      <p>
        He did not care at all whether or not that person Wang Xu was finished
        with him or not. Now he only felt extremely depressed, that -Moment-,
        the selfie that exuded the warmth and comfort of a family after he
        disappeared made him suddenly have a sense of complete weightlessness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Naturally, the people he didn’t care about didn’t care about him; it
        also conformed to logic.
      </p>

      <p>Nonetheless, it was still suffocating.</p>

      <p>
        He stared at the textbook, the smell of the paper and ink had the faint
        fragrance of milk. He suddenly felt a bit hungry and remembered that he
        did not eat breakfast in the morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned to the side only to see Gu Fei, who was watching a video while
        peeling open a milk candy.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s gaze met with his. After he paused for a moment, he reached
        into his pocket, took out another candy and placed it on his book before
        his gaze returned to the cellphone screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at the candy on his book, feeling somewhat baffled.
        However, his stomach was screaming since the smell of the milk candy
        floated over from Gu Fei’s side.
      </p>

      <p>
        After hesitating for two minutes, he picked up the candy and peeled it
        open.
      </p>

      <p>… to his surprise, it was not a milk candy!</p>

      <p>It was a fruit candy!</p>

      <p>
        He couldn’t control himself and turned his head to look at Gu Fei again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at the fruit candy in his hand, looked down and reached
        into his own pocket again. When his hand reappeared, he placed a handful
        of candies directly on Jiang Cheng’s desk – there were all sorts of
        wrappers and flavors, certainly more than a dozen before him.
      </p>

      <p>“Pick for yourself,” Gu Fei said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Even in elementary school, Jiang Cheng never had a chance to pick out
        candies like this since his parents basically never allowed them to eat
        candy or any junk food and soft drinks. He always felt as though he
        lived the life of someone that practiced Daoism to the extent that he
        still doesn’t quite like eating snacks or sugary products right now -it
        was Pan Zhi who had always stuffed him with a bunch of food that he
        found tasty.
      </p>

      <span id="more-5442"></span>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        And now that Gu Fei had scattered a handful of candy on his desk for him
        to pick out, he suddenly felt very refreshed by the idea.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Coffee candy, milk candy, mint candy, fruit candy… and there was even a
        difference between soft and hard candies. He stared at them for a long
        time contemplating before picking up a milk candy.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Just as he peeled the wrapper open, Gu Fei reached out again and took
        away the remaining ones left on the desk.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Fuck?” Jiang Cheng froze, remembering that Gu Fei had said, “pick for
        yourself’, and not, “it’s all for you” – such tightly-woven logic made
        him momentarily convinced. Yet, he could not help but look at him, “Are
        you gonna have Wang Jian Lin<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> riding on your
        coattail tomorrow from your stingy ways?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Gu Fei made no sound as he looked down at the candies in his hand,
        picked out the other two pieces of milk candies and placed them in front
        of Jiang Cheng before putting the rest back into his own pocket.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true"><em>… Sicko!</em></p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng peeled open all three milk candies and jammed them into his
        mouth, not sure what else he could express.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The English teacher had a surname of Lu and his class was much more
        controlled than Lao Xu in the sense that he made sure everyone was
        focused and quiet as birds. This was because he roared at people, hence
        his effectiveness in class was better than Lao Xu.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Even though Jiang Cheng felt that the teachers he had met today were
        incomparable to his previous teachers, Lu Laoshi’s<a href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >
        class was exceptionally overdriven. He would wave around his pointer at
        anyone who dared to scratch their itch and even asked if they needed
        help. It has been a long time since Jiang Cheng was this concentrated on
        a lesson and he would instantly be startled back to reality from the
        slightest distraction.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The class erupted in excitement after the dismissal bell rang and as if
        they had been greatly suppressed, there were even people who let out a
        few howls and wails while stretching their backs.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You!” Lu Laoshi’s pointer was suddenly aimed toward the back of the
        classroom, “Come with me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        This “<em>you</em>” and this “<em>point</em>” stretched over quite a
        wide range of possibilities. Everyone’s head rolled to the back of the
        class as if they were passing on hot-potatoes again but Jiang Cheng paid
        no attention when he felt their gazes fall on him. He was a newly
        transferred student, and the teacher couldn’t even put a name on him
        yet…
      </p>

      <p>“Gu Fei!” Lu Laoshi roared once more.</p>

      <p>
        “… ay,” Gu Fei had his head down and was on his phone, but this sudden
        outcry made his phone fall directly onto the floor. He raised his head
        to look at Lu Laoshi and then twisted his head slightly to the side in
        Jiang Cheng’s direction, “He’s calling you.”
      </p>

      <p>“Hm?” Jiang Cheng froze, “He’s calling me?”</p>

      <p>
        “Yes, you! Gu Fei’s deskmate!” Lu Laoshi pointed his pointer in their
        direction again and the few heads underneath the path of his pointer all
        quickly dissipated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had no choice but stand, unsure of what this English teacher
        wanted from him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he was walking toward the classroom door, he turned around to
        look at Wang Xu and saw that the guy had also stood up – presumably, if
        the teacher hadn’t called Jiang Cheng away, the two would have already
        been at war.
      </p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng, right?” Lu Laoshi turned to walk downstairs.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng sounded and followed him down the stairs. “Do you need
        me for something?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Xu Zong was even flaunting you in front of me before, saying that a
        Real ‘dot’ Xueba<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> has arrived…” Lu Laoshi said.
      </p>

      <p>“What? Real ‘dot’?” Jiang Cheng didn’t understand.</p>

      <p>
        “A real, dot, Xueba.” Lu Laoshi gave him a look as he explained the
        meaning, “You don’t even understand this?”
      </p>

      <p><em>Real · Xuébà.</em></p>

      <p>
        “… now, I do.” It was the first time that Jiang Cheng knew there were
        people who actually pronounced the <em>dot</em> out loud.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Our school was a regular high school before, later it was turned into a
        vocational high school, and much later converted back to a regular high
        school again,” Lu Laoshi said. “So this can’t be compared to your
        previous school. I hope you won’t be affected – however you studied
        before, you can continue to do so in the same way now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng thought about how he studied before and felt that this
        teacher did not know much about him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “People like Wang Xu ah, Gu Fei ah, don’t provoke them too much, they’re
        all a bunch of dawdlers,” Lu Laoshi said. “If I didn’t bring you out,
        he’d be giving you trouble right now. His mission wouldn’t be
        accomplished without receiving a punishment, also, he already has a few
        records of demerits on him.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh.” Jiang Cheng nodded and thought this Lu Laoshi cared quite a bit
        for his students.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re not going to thank me?” Lu Laoshi looked at him rather
        displeased.
      </p>

      <p>“Thank you,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>
        “Your score for English is pretty top-notch. Just come and be my class
        representative,” Lu Laoshi quickly added. “The current English
        Representative in your class is Yi Jing who is also the Class President
        and concurrently the Language Class Representative…”
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Jiang Cheng was surprised, then quickly shook his head, “No.”</p>

      <p>
        “Why not,” Lu Laoshi was quite surprised. “I heard from Lao Xu that you
        were actually the Class President before, you can’t think a Class Rep is
        too tiring, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I was only the Class President for one semester anyway,” Jiang Cheng
        said.
      </p>

      <p>“Why’s that?” Lu Laoshi asked.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looked at him: “Fighting and cutting class.”</p>

      <p>
        Lu Laoshi stared at him with wide eyes, his mouth opened but no words
        came out.
      </p>

      <p>“Then, I’ll head back to class?” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “You… wait a minute,” Lu Laoshi gave it a thought. “How about helping me
        prepare lessons during your free time?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng mentally sighed and very much wanted to say, ‘I don’t have a
        computer right now’, but this Lu Laoshi seemed pretty chill – it would
        be bad to reject him again after the first time, so he nodded.
      </p>

      <p>“Okay,” Lu Laoshi smiled. “You can go back to class now.”</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck, taking so long to come back.” Wang Xu was sitting on Jiang
        Cheng’s desk, “He’s probably avoiding
        <em
          >laozi<a href="#_ftn4"><strong>[4]</strong></a></em
        >, but he can’t beat the odds forever!”
      </p>

      <p>“Lao Lu probably needs him for something,” Zhou Jing said.</p>

      <p>
        “Something my ass, have you ever seen Lao Lu need anyone for anything!
        Probably no more than to ask about his situation because he’s a new
        transferred student. They’ve likely finished talking already but the
        sucker’s too scared to come back to class!” Wang Xu said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You want to resolve it here?” Gu Fei, who was quietly playing games on
        his phone the whole time, finally popped a question.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Bullshit!” Wang Xu pushed lightly at his hair, with anger coming from
        no specific direction. “Fuck!”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei put down his phone, raised his head and peered at him.</p>

      <p>“… where else can this be resolved,” Wang Xu became hesitant.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t care,” Gu Fei said, “Don’t fight around me. Geez, don’t you
        find it bothersome?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How about you let it pass,” Zhou Jing said. “You both got a chance at
        revenge already, so it’s even.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Even my fucking ass!” Wang Xu turned his head and glared at Zhou Jing.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If not in the fields then do it outside of the school.” Gu Fei
        continued to play his hand game, “Just not near me, it’s annoying.”
      </p>

      <p>“He’s back,” Zhou Jing said.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked up as his gaze swept through the front of the room to see
        Jiang Cheng slowly make his way back with his hands in his pockets and
        eyes on Wang Xu.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hiding from me?” Wang Xu sneered, “The class bell hasn’t even rung yet
        you have the nerve to come back?”
      </p>

      <p>“Three things,” Jiang Cheng said firmly.</p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu stared at him, appearing to not have registered what he had
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “One, get down,” Jiang Cheng stuck out a finger, then stuck out a second
        finger. “Second, the person that ditches first is a jackass.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Wang Xu finally recuperated and bulged his eyes wide open to speak,
        Jiang Cheng had already raised a third finger to interrupt him. “Three,
        how you want to resolve this – give it to me straight but if it’s just
        fighting with your mouth<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> then I surrender.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After he finished talking, the class that was waiting for a bustling
        scene suddenly fell silent.
      </p>

      <p>Everyone was waiting for Wang Xu’s reaction.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s bent his head back, leaned his body against the back wall and
        let out a low whistle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Based off of Gu Fei’s many years of experience in being a melon-eating
        audience<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>, Jiang Cheng’s words and the manner in
        which he delivered them instantly made Wang Xu’s road to becoming the
        big boss muffled to a blur.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that, the expression on Wang Xu’s face changed enigmatically. Jiang
        Cheng could not determine what he was thinking but the immediate
        movement of his gaze towards Gu Fei’s direction did not go unseen by
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu was afraid of Gu Fei, or at least, he unconsciously regarded Gu
        Fei as his defender.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the moment he saw ‘Bu, Shi, Hao, Niao’ in Gu Fei’s family shop,
        Jiang Cheng knew that Gu Fei’s seemingly mild, well-mannered and state
        of ‘it’s none of my business’ was all a facade.
      </p>

      <p><em>Tsk.</em></p>

      <p><em>Bluffing as an old immortal free-roaming the universe.</em></p>

      <p>
        “I’ll wait for you after school at noon.” Wang Xu jumped off the desk
        and pointed back at Jiang Cheng while walking back to his own seat, “In
        due time, don’t run.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng replied and sat down.</p>

      <p>
        After giving it some thought, he leaned his head to the side and asked
        Gu Fei: “Is this guy the big boss in your class?”
      </p>

      <p>
        From this distance, he was suddenly aware that the rest on the left side
        of Gu Fei’s undercut had three dots, a thirty-two beats rest.
      </p>

      <p>“Basically,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>“What does ‘basically’ mean?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “It means that if anyone disagrees then he’ll fight them.” Gu Fei was
        still staring at his phone, his fingers actively swiping at the screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng could distinguish that he was actually playing Craz3 Match<a
          href="#_ftn7"
          >[7]</a
        >, a mini-game he played during middle school because there was nothing
        better to play when he needed to kill time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from watching videos, Gu Fei was unexpectedly not only entirely
        occupied by this game, but also quite devoted too –<em> how retarded</em
        >.
      </p>

      <p>“You still play that?” Jiang Cheng could not help but ask.</p>

      <p>
        “En, wastes no brain power,” Gu Fei said. “It’s not like I’m a
        <em>xueba</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything that Jiang Cheng had seen this morning had already put him in
        a sour mood, and now having heard this word, he almost landed a punch
        straight on the thirty-two-beat rest on Gu Fei’s undercut.
      </p>

      <p>
        He gritted his teeth to refrain from moving his hand – one reason was
        that Gu Fei helped him when he fainted, two because he just finished
        eating three of Gu Fei’s milk candies…
        <em>does this even count as a reason?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        “To have the ability to directly confront your watery brain can be
        considered a courageous act,” he said. “I have faith in you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei turned his face over to look at him; his face was expressionless,
        but his tone was exceptionally slap-worthy. “Good luck at noon
        <em>oh</em>.~”
      </p>

      <p><em>‘Oh~’ you fucking sick dog!</em></p>

      <p><em>Fuck.</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t pay much attention to the lesson afterward, his heart
        felt suffocated – after blacklisting the family of three, he still
        couldn’t help but feel the urge to reopen their -Moments-.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their relationship was indeed rough and certainly tense as well, but
        nonetheless, it was the “home” he resided for decades and they were the
        “family members” he had come face to face with every day – these were
        not sentiments he could castaway within the next second.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it seemed as though no one was affected by his absence or even the
        likelihood of never meeting again… maybe they just didn’t express it?
      </p>

      <p>
        This form of peacefulness made him feel even more depleted than being
        kicked out of the home he had lived in for years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Deciding to forget it and sleep for a bit, he lied his head on the desk,
        pulled down his hat to cover his forehead and closed his eyes. He never
        had trouble sleeping in a new environment, but he had been unable to
        sleep soundly after his arrival.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo’s house was too decrepit, in addition, the person himself was
        overtly sloppy, therefore not only were there cockroaches and spiders,
        but there were also mice. For the entire night, he listened to the sound
        of mice roaming the space of his room, causing him to have the
        misconception that he was sleeping within a pile of garbage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The teachers at Si Zhong were a lot more understanding than the ones at
        his previous school. Jiang Cheng slept directly through the break in
        between classes without a raise of his head, and not a single teacher
        came over to disrupt him whatsoever.
      </p>

      <p>
        That was until the bell indicating an end to the last class of the day
        had rung and Wang Xu’s palm slapping the surface of his desk did Jiang
        Cheng finally straighten his body with a yawn, aching all over.
      </p>

      <p>“Let’s go,” Wang Xu glared at him.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not make a sound. He shoved his textbooks and what-not
        into the slot below the surface of his desk, then picked up his school
        bag and stood up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu turned his body around with swag and walked toward the door. If
        it wasn’t for the fact that he was wearing a down-filled jacket and the
        lack of wind indoors, there would definitely be an aura of “here comes
        the big boss.”
      </p>

      <p>
        There were also three to four people tailing him and based on the
        excitement on their faces, it was plausible he brought his little
        sidekicks along as well. The others who wanted to catch a good show had
        yet caught up to them.
      </p>

      <p>“Hey,” Jiang Cheng called Wang Xu from behind.</p>

      <p>“Chickening out?” Wang Xu immediately answered.</p>

      <p>
        “Are these your teammates or the cheerleading squad?” Jiang Cheng asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu looked at the people beside him and glared back at Jiang Cheng,
        “Why, scared?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “A cheerleading squad doesn’t matter,” Jiang Cheng’s gaze swept across
        them and as he continued forward, he added: “If it’s to get physical
        then you guys should arrange a numbered order within yourselves.”
      </p>

      <p>“You guys, stop following.” Wang Xu waved his hand.</p>

      <p>“Are you gonna go watch?” Zhou Jing bumped at the desk.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was still playing the Craz3 Match game that only people without a
        <em>xueba</em>’s intelligence loved to play, only having passed a level
        did he finally stand up. “Nope.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s go and take a look, aren’t you afraid something will happen?”
        Zhou Jing said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Does it look like whatever happens will happen to me?” Gu Fei put his
        phone inside his pocket, turned around and left.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he walked down to the ground floor, he arrived just in time to see
        Wang Xu’s little followers gazing fixedly toward the direction of the
        back gate. Jiang Cheng and Wang Xu’s shadows were nowhere in sight.
      </p>

      <p>“Da Fei…” someone immediately inched over when they saw him.</p>

      <p>
        “Shh,” Gu Fei stuck his index finger vertically in front of his lips.
        “Don’t annoy me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The elementary school students had yet to start school today which meant
        that Gu Miao was definitely waiting for him in front of the front
        entrance an hour ago, therefore, he didn’t have the leisure time to see
        Wang Xu get beaten up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Indeed, Gu Fei’s arbitrary judgment was definite that when Wang Xu
        clashed with Jiang Cheng, it was his fate to receive a good, good
        beating.
      </p>

      <p>
        The indifference in Jiang Cheng’s eyes was something Wang Xu did not
        possess and his whole body was also tightly woven with an air of
        irritation that could scare a claustrophobic to death. If it wasn’t
        because he had recently come across some unhappy circumstances, then
        this person had a long-term psychological irregularity.
      </p>

      <p>
        How could Wang Xu, a patient with Zhong Erbing<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a>
        who dreamt of being a master in the great Jianghu<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a
        >, compete with a moody psychopath?
      </p>

      <p>
        Once he exited the school gates, a green head whizzed past him like a
        sharp blow of wind – a “<em>whoosh</em>” sound emitted from all around.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei walked toward the bicycle racks to retrieve his own bike but just
        as he swung his leg over the seat, Gu Miao once again passed him like
        the blowing winds – only stopping by his side for approximately two
        seconds to steal a handful of candies from his pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he rode his bike to the intersection, Gu Miao was standing on the
        sidewalk peeling open a candy wrapper – all the fruit candies had been
        specially picked out for herself.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You want me to give you a ride?” Gu Fei asked. “Or do you want to
        follow behind?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Just when Gu Miao picked up her skateboard and was getting ready to
        straddle the backseat, Gu Fei stopped her and held up her chin to look
        at the scratch mark on the corner of her eyes. “Was this a scratch from
        somewhere or did you get into a fight?”
      </p>

      <p>“A scratch,” Gu Miao said.</p>

      <p>“Get on,” Gu Fei didn’t ask again.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao brought the skateboard to her chest and sat down in the back
        with her arms wrapped around his waist.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe it was a scratch, maybe it was a bruise left from fighting with
        someone, but whatever the case was, this little girl was dead stubborn.
        There was no point in asking and you couldn’t overly meddle in her
        affairs – she had to solve her own problems, even if it meant getting
        beat up.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How ‘bout I take you to buy a new pair of gloves,” Gu Fei peddled the
        bike. “The little leather gloves you wanted last time?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao immediately took off the mucky down-filled gloves that were
        currently on her own hands, stuck up a thumb and waved it in front of Gu
        Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Si Zhong’s back gate was more prosperous than the entrance – it was
        quite the miraculous sight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most likely because the back door was connected to a small narrow street
        and the management was quite poor with all sorts of food cars lined up
        one after another; the main point was, the food was very well-favored.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Jiang Cheng caught scents of the deliciously smelling aromas while he
        walked alongside Wang Xu, he almost wanted to make the suggestion of
        treating him to a meal first….
      </p>

      <p>
        But seeing that Wang Xu’s appearance was full of enmity and his gaze
        full of persistence, Jiang Cheng stopped himself, not wanting to anger
        the guy into tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Might as well treat this as a tour then and come back to eat
          later.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        There sure was a lot of things he wanted to eat – all sorts of barbequed
        items that is: fatty beef, marbled lamb meat, kidneys, tendons.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng subtly swallowed his saliva.</p>

      <p>
        As they walked out of the narrow streetway, the savory scent also
        evaporated. Jiang Cheng was unsure of where in the world Wang Xu wanted
        to go.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are we having a hiking match?” Jiang Cheng asked out loud, extremely
        irked due to an empty stomach.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu ignored him, but then he came to an abrupt stop after taking a
        few more steps, his eyebrows scrunched together as he looked ahead.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng followed his gaze and looked ahead.</p>

      <p>
        From a distance of approximately half a meter stood three people, all of
        whom had their hands in their pocket and was staring back in their
        direction. After he and Wang Xu both turned their gaze to glance back at
        them, the three slowly made their way over.
      </p>

      <p>Wang Xu reached his hand inside his pocket.</p>

      <p>
        “What’s wrong?” Across from them stood a tall, lean guy who looked as if
        he had been in hunger for tens of years, smiling at them. “Are you going
        to call Gu Fei? The guy left just a second ago with his little sister,
        he probably won’t have the mind to meddle in your lame business.”
      </p>

      <p>“What do you want?!’ Wang Xu asked with a raspy, impatient voice.</p>

      <p>
        “Yo,” the tall lean guy dramatically put on a display of astonishment.
        “You’re quite tough today, not gonna run?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Then he swept his gaze over Jiang Cheng’s face: “Did you find a new
        buddy? He must be a kick-ass, with him here you don’t even need to run
        anymore.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Before, it was actually a crowd of them running away with the wind
        picking up as they passed,” a person behind the tall lean guy added
        sardonically.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tall lean guy displayed a face full of mockery as he looked at the
        two, “How about I count to three and you two…”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng smashed a fist right at his nose.</p>

      <p>
        This fist not only smashed the guy’s speech to pieces, but also the
        opposing members to confusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not stop there – this sort of thing was all about
        fighting a quick battle and arriving at a quick closure.
      </p>

      <p>
        After throwing a fist, he grabbed the tall lean guy by the hair along
        with his hat and pulled him downwards before letting his knee collide
        once again with the guy’s nose.
      </p>

      <p>
        The strength he used both times were minor. With Jiang Cheng’s
        experience, the guy’s nose bridge won’t run into major problems, but his
        nose bleed will explode from within to create the effect of ketchup
        being smeared all over his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        As expected, when Jiang Cheng released his hand and brutally shoved the
        tall lean guy aside, the blood in his nose instantly flooded out and he
        instinctively went to wipe it…
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked to Wang Xu, then as he took a step forward, his elbow
        smashed upon an arm that was presumably reaching for a knife, so taking
        advantage of the position he was in, Jiang Cheng smashed the guy’s nose
        with his cranium.
      </p>

      <p>The person let out an “ow” and grasped his nose in pain.</p>

      <p>
        “Run, you stupid cunt!” Jiang Cheng yelled at Wang Xu as took to his
        heels and break out into a run toward the direction ahead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu remained dazed for a moment before hurriedly charging behind
        Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This way.” When they arrived at the intersection, Wang Xu pointed
        toward the left side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng followed behind, twisting and turning into an alleyway and
        then made two more turns until they finally stopped in front of an empty
        space in front of someone’s fenced backyard.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What is this place?” Jiang Cheng glanced around his surroundings only
        to realize that this was a dead end. All three sides were fenced in by
        residents, decrepit and tattered, the floor was piled with the build-up
        of snow and fallen tree branches – and littered with all sorts of
        garbage.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This is…” Wang Xu inhaled heavily for a moment, “The place where I
        schedule fights with people.”
      </p>

      <p>“Your taste is quite unique,” Jiang Cheng commented.</p>

      <p>
        “Umm,” Wang Xu looked at him and after hesitating for a long time, he
        finally said: “For just now… thanks.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Thank me for what,” Jiang Cheng fished out a cigarette from his pocket
        and dangled it in his mouth after it was lit. “It’s not like I meant to
        help you.”
      </p>

      <p>Wang Xu stared at him: “Fuck, are you really a <em>xueba</em>?”</p>

      <p>
        “Let’s resolve the issue between us now,” Jiang Cheng said
        matter-of-factly as he checked the time. “I’m hungry, hurry up and end
        this, I want to eat.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s resolved,” Wang Xu sat down on a chair nearby that was dilapidated
        to the point of looking like a prop used in a haunted house. “There’s no
        issue between us now.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng clicked his tongue: “Then I’m leaving.”</p>

      <p>
        “Wait a sec,” Wang Xu stopped him. “Hou Zi<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a> is
        definitely still around this area. They have more people, you’ll run
        into them if you go out now.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng did not respond.</p>

      <p>
        “For real, you saw only three just now. Since you beat up Hou Zi until
        his face was covered in blood, there definitely won’t be just the three
        of them anymore if you leave and bump into them again. I… I’ll call
        someone over to help.” Wang Xu took out his phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng thought back to what the tall lean guy said previously and
        then with scrunched up eyebrows he asked: “Who are you calling?”
      </p>

      <p>“Da Fei,” Wang Xu said.</p>

      <p>
        “What the fuck? Gu Fei?” Jiang Cheng immediately felt the skin on his
        face swiftly fall to the ground.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng threw the cigarette then turned around and walked toward the
        entrance of the alley.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey! Don’t go out!” Wang Xu shouted. “Do you think I’m afraid of
        problems?! We can’t afford to offend Hou Zi and his group! Last
        semester, someone from Qi Zhong<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> was beaten to
        the point of being hospitalized for several months!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Can’t afford to offend?” Jiang Cheng turned to look at him, “Such a
        capable bastard yet you’re calling only Gu Fei over to deal with him?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei is different,” Wang Xu said. “He grew up in this area as a child
        and also… anyways, just listen to me. Since you’ve helped me once, I
        can’t let you go out there and lose your head ah.”
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>And also… and also what?</em>
        <em>And also, he killed his own father? </em>Jiang Cheng suddenly
        remembered Li Baoguo’s words and laughed inexplicably. For an old
        historical district in this small city to have such a
        <em>legend</em> within just a few streets, it was quite interesting.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck are you laughing at!” Wang Xu was angry with his laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng ignored him and prepared to continue on, but just as he took
        one step, Wang Xu held him from behind and then carried him back.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey, hey, hey,” Jiang Cheng was startled by his action. “Let go! What’s
        your problem?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Problem?” Wang Xu questioned in shock then quickly loosened his hand.
        “I don’t have any … I don’t have any other intention ah! You better not
        misunderstand! Don’t misunderstand!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at him: “Did I say you have any other intention?”
      </p>

      <p>Wang Xu didn’t speak as he dialed a number on his mobile phone.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sighed and lit another cigarette, crouching in the corner of
        a small area and absentmindedly brushed away the snow on the ground with
        a twig.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei, Da Fei,” Wang Xu held the phone close and suppressed his voice
        as if that fellow Hou Zi was keeping watch in the courtyard beside them.
        “We’re being blocked by Hou Zi… we ran, no, right now we can’t get out…
        he got a bloody face from a punch, how can we leave! Who else can it be
        <em>huh</em>, me and Jiang Cheng.”
      </p>

      <p>Wang Xu said that while glancing over at Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not exchange any meaningful look with him. Although Wang
        Xu did not have many capabilities, he was not that terrified of others
        so for him to be scared like this, he reckoned, those people must indeed
        not be trifled with.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, when he loafed around in his previous school, he also did not
        want to provoke others much – it was too troublesome.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just thinking that Gu Fei was on the other side of the phone, he thought
        that it was better to go out and put up a good fight, but he was still
        rational. If he did go out, it might not be a matter of just one or two
        fights.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei will be here in a bit,” Wang Xu relayed as he hung up and used
        his foot to flick the garbage heap to the side. “He took his sister out
        to eat noodles… they haven’t finished yet.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng was simply speechless.</p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu found a wooden stick about half a meter long from the garbage
        heap and threw it at his feet, then after rummaging through it for a
        while longer in vain, he started to dismantle the damaged three-legged
        chair.
      </p>

      <p>“What are you doing?” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Looking for some weapons,” Wang Xu said. “Hou Zi and the others are
        familiar with this area, so this is just in case they arrive here before
        Gu Fei, okay?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sighed. He grabbed his schoolbag and searched around until
        he eventually fished out a knife and threw it at his feet. “Use this.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck!” Wang Xu was utterly shocked and turned his head to stare at
        him. “Are you really a fucking <em>xueba</em>? What kind of
        <em>xueba</em> has nothing better to do than to go out with a knife!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ve never used it,” Jiang Cheng said. “The edge of the blade isn’t
        sharpened. It’s specially used to scare people.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu picked up the knife and looked at it with earnest for a moment
        then went over to crouch in front of him. “Jiang Cheng, I can’t afford
        to offend you.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng glanced at him without speaking.</p>

      <p>
        “The beef between us has already been settled.” Wang Xu continued to
        say, “In the future, we can just mind our own business. How’s that?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can remember these words for yourself,” Jiang Cheng said. “Our
        <em>xueba</em> will be busy studying, he can’t blindly waste his time
        with you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Once he finished, the two no longer spoke and took to crouching in
        silence face to face.
      </p>

      <p>After a while, Wang Xu spoke: “I’ll give you a word of advice.”</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng looked at the cigarette butt between his fingers – the
        rising smoke twisted frantically in the wind and quickly disappeared
        without any traces.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If Hou Zi arrives first, just cower,” Wang Xu said. “No matter how
        jackass we are, we’re still students. We can’t put our life on the line
        against those guys who mingle in society.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at him in shock,
        <em
          >this idiot unexpectedly has the intelligence for survival
          instinct.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>“Gu Fei said that,” Wang Xu added.</p>

      <p>
        Hearing that, Jiang Cheng almost wanted to put out the cigarette on his
        face.
      </p>

      <p>
        To be honest, Gu Fei’s arrival wasn’t considered to be slow. It took him
        roughly ten minutes to appear on his bicycle, but what made it hard for
        Jiang Cheng to understand was why he brought Gu Miao along with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The little girl had held onto a rope tied to the back of the bicycle as
        she rode on her skateboard.
      </p>

      <p><em>A whole family of mental cases!</em></p>

      <p>
        Just as Gu Fei’s foot landed on the ground for support, Gu Miao jumped
        off the skateboard, stepped hard on the board so that it lifted up and
        caught it with her hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        She walked over and stood in front of Jiang Cheng while hugging the
        skateboard. She smiled at him and then ran back to Gu Fei and leaned
        against his leg.
      </p>

      <p>“Who threw the punch?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“Me,” Jiang Cheng stood up. “Why?”</p>

      <p>“You ran into Hou Zi?” Wang Xu asked immediately.</p>

      <p>
        “At the entrance of the alley.” Gu Fei glanced at him, “I reckon he’s
        coming in now.”
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck,” Wang Xu frowned. “Can we get out?”</p>

      <p>
        “Depends on how you want to get out,” Gu Fei said and looked at Jiang
        Cheng again. “There are two solutions.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng knew that this time he had probably stirred up a bit of a
        problem. He sighed and placed his hands in his pockets as he leaned
        against the wall. “Say it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let him get back at you, it’ll be over once it’s even,” Gu Fei said.
        “If you’re not willing, I’ll lead you guys out, but it’ll depend on luck
        the next time you run into them.”
      </p>

      <p>Wang Xu quickly looked over at Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        “Getting even is no problem, but let’s settle on the fact that if anyone
        dares to add another hit, I’ll hit back,” Jiang Cheng said. 　　
      </p>

      <p>
        When Hou Zi returned, his nose was stuffed with cotton balls, which made
        Jiang Cheng think that he probably had slightly low blood platelets –
        the bleeding hadn’t stopped yet after such a long time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as Wang Xu said, Hou Zi had indeed brought a lot of people with him
        this time around. One glance was enough to surmise that there were seven
        to eight people, each with the strong temperament of small-town
        hoodlums.
      </p>

      <p>“Er Miao, go wait for me at the head of the alley,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao looked at Jiang Cheng and then put her skateboard down, stepped
        up on it and then skated out of the crowd like an arrow.
      </p>

      <p>“You also go out,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei propped up on the handlebar of the bicycle and looked at him for
        a moment: “Wang Xu, come out with me.”
      </p>

      <p>“I…” Wang Xu hesitated as he looked over at Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        “Go out,” Jiang Cheng said – for this act of purely being hit, he did
        not want an audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei lift the head of the bicycle up and turned it around the other
        way, Wang Xu got on.
      </p>

      <p>With a gloomy face, Hou Zi walked over to where Jiang Cheng was.</p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei passed by him, he suddenly grabbed his right wrist and took
        his hand out of his pocket.
      </p>

      <p>“What are you doing?” Hou Zi looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t say anything. He slid his hand firmly down Hou Zi’s wrist
        and took something from his hand before throwing it to the foot of the
        wall to the side.
      </p>

      <p>The sound of metal hitting the brick wall was quite crisp.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng followed the source of the sound for a look, it was a black
        brass knuckle.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fucker.</em></p>

      <p>
        “The rules still need to be explained,” Gu Fei said aloud as he stepped
        on the pedal and rode his bicycle to the other side of the alley.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nothing’s going to happen to him, right?” Wang Xu stood beneath a
        leafless tree at the head of the alley, shrinking his neck. He watched
        as Gu Miao rode the skateboard around a heap of snow beneath a nearby
        tree.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you’re afraid of trouble then don’t go provoking it,” Gu Fei put it
        simply.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I didn’t provoke any trouble. When I saw Hou Zi, I even ran for it,”
        Wang Xu said. “Fuck, damn it! How was I supposed to know I would run
        into him today. Jiang Cheng doesn’t know what’s up either and directly
        threw a punch.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The beef between you two has been resolved?” Gu Fei looked at his face,
        “Did you kneel down and begged him not to punch you in the face?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… that’s enough,” Wang Xu sighed and turned to look toward the alley.
        “Just take it as my eyes have been opened. There’s also this type of
        <em>xueba</em>, I can’t afford to offend him.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei laughed out loud.</p>

      <p>After less than a few minutes, Hou Zi and his group came out.</p>

      <p>
        Although Hou Zi’s face was a bit unsightly, he appeared ‘normal’,
        however, the person following behind him didn’t look too wonderful –
        there was a very large swelling on his forehead.
      </p>

      <p>“Did he hit back?” Wang Xu was taken aback when he saw it.</p>

      <p>
        After Hou Zi and Gu Fei exchanged a glance, neither said anything as the
        group left.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck, where’s that stupid cunt, Jiang Cheng?” Wang Xu looked toward the
        alley.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei frowned.
        <em
          >Jiang Cheng definitely hit back – hard. He mustn’t have initiated it,
          someone must have ‘added another hit’ but it’s reasonable to say that
          Hou Zi wouldn’t be able to break the rules under this
          circumstance.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p><em>Then, where’s Jiang Cheng?</em></p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Even if he had to wind around a few times, it shouldn’t take him this
          long to come out…</em
        >
        the phone in his pocket sounded, he took it out for a look and to his
        surprise, it was Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>“Where are you?” He answered the call.</p>

      <p>“I… got lost,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>“What?” Gu Fei was utterly shocked, “Lost?”</p>

      <p>
        “Yes, lost! There was a bunch of turns when we came in, now I don’t even
        know which turn to take. The alleys must have been fucking built into a
        maze!” Jiang Cheng said in a very bad mood.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You… wait a moment.” Gu Fei looked at Gu Miao, “Er Miao, go in and lead
        Jiang Cheng- <em>gege</em> out of there.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao stepped on the skateboard and flew into the alley at lightning
        speed.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng heard the sound of the skateboard wheels, he shouted:
        “Gu Miao?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao’s silhouette flashed out from a corner ahead and waved at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng went over – in fact, he had just come from there. He
        followed after Gu Miao and turn another corner before seeing the small
        street from before.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Fuck. If I had known it was this close, I wouldn’t have called Gu Fei
          and put myself to shame.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        The shame that happened today was actually enough to form a four-item
        combo.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You okay?” Wang Xu asked the moment he saw him come out and then stared
        at his face.
      </p>

      <p>“It’s nothing,” Jiang Cheng rubbed his stomach.</p>

      <p>“You didn’t get hit in the face, huh?” Wang Xu looked at his hand.</p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng looked at him. “Why, you want a hit?”</p>

      <p>
        “I’m just asking,” Wang Xi said. “You got hit in the stomach? Does it
        hurt?”
      </p>

      <p>“I’m hungry,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “You hit back, didn’t you?” Wang Xu continued to question closely. “I
        saw someone come out with a huge bump on his forehead. How did it
        happen?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I said that if someone <em>dared</em> to add another hit, I would hit
        back,” Jiang Cheng answered somewhat impatiently. “I took his head and
        smashed it on the wall. Why, do you want to try it?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m going home,” Wang Xu said. “I’m leaving… then, Gu Fei, I’ll treat
        you to lunch tomorrow afternoon.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After Wang Xu left, Jiang Cheng and Gu Fei stood together and watched Gu
        Miao play on the skateboard, a moment later he spoke. “Thanks.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Although he suffered two punches in the stomach from Hou Zi to the point
        that he still felt like vomiting even then, if Gu Fei hadn’t been there,
        this option to settle the dispute wouldn’t have existed. He reckoned
        that, from then on, he would probably run into Hou Zi scouting around
        every time he went out the door. If that was the case, life could end
        there and then.
      </p>

      <p>“Are you really okay?” Gu Fei glanced at him.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng didn’t want to discuss this matter at all. He thought
        about it and asked, “Have you eaten?”
      </p>

      <p>“No,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        “… Wang Xu said that you were eating noodles just now and would come
        once you were done,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Please, you two would have been beaten to pieces already,” Gu Fei said.
        “I was eating on the pedestrian-only street. If I actually came after I
        finished, it would’ve taken a good half an hour.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s go eat a little more.” Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Miao, “What do
        you want to eat?”
      </p>

      <p>Naturally, Gu Miao did not answer him and merely looked at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>“You can just lead the way,” Gu Fei patted her temple lightly.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao quickly stepped on the skateboard and dashed to the barbeque
        stands from before.
      </p>

      <p>“Get on,” Gu Fei looked at Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>“I’ll walk there,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei did not say any more and rode off on his bicycle.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sighed. He pressed on his stomach only to feel like retching
        a bit, not knowing whether it was from hunger or the two punches from
        Hou Zi.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao picked the barbeque stand that was closest to the side, and when
        Jiang Cheng strolled over, she had already selected a bunch of food to
        eat.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng smelled the aroma of the barbeque, the uncomfortable
        feeling in his stomach slowly disappeared – leaving only a strong sense
        of hunger. He went over and pointed at the meat: “The same ten skewers
        and also 1kg of crayfish.”
      </p>

      <p>
        This stand didn’t have crayfish, so he ran to another stand that was
        half a street away and brought back a kilo.
      </p>

      <p>
        When several large pieces of meat piled on the table, Gu Fei could not
        help but ask: “Have you always been able to eat this much all at once?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Xiao Ming’s grandfather lived for 103 years,”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>
        Jiang Cheng picked up a lamb skewer and took a bite.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed and had the boss bring a small bottle of the Red Star’s
        Er Guo Tou Liquor.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, Jiang Cheng wanted to ask, “do you have to drink when you
        eat”, but Xiao Ming’s 103 years old grandfather stopped him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao didn’t speak, and he didn’t have much to say either, therefore,
        it was exactly like the last time they ate barbeque together –
        completely silent until they finished eating.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was also quite nice, eating to the fullest. Every time he ate with
        Pan Zhi, because he talked nonstop and often did not eat enough or to
        the fullest, they had to add more food.
      </p>

      <p>
        They were at a very lively barbeque stand and their table was like a
        bright and beautiful scenery – every time the boss passed by, he would
        glance at them, perhaps thinking that they were here for a negotiation
        appointment and could possibly get up and pull a knife out at any given
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Miao ate her fill and removed her hat off to grab her head,
        Jiang Cheng finally broke the ongoing silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why did you buy her a green hat?” he asked Gu Fei; this question had
        plagued him perpetually since the day he saw Gu Miao at the shop.
      </p>

      <p>“She likes green,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Miao’s green hat again – Gu Fei’s answer
        was always so logical and tidy that it would make anyone unable to
        accept it. “Being able to buy a hat of this color is also a miracle ah.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao shook her head.</p>

      <p>“En?” Jiang Cheng looked at her.</p>

      <p>“It wasn’t bought,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Knitted?” Jiang Cheng touched the hat,
        <em>you really can’t tell, the handwork is pretty good. </em>“Who knit
        it for you huh? Your mom?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao smiled and pointed at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng fiercely turned his head to look at Gu Fei: “What the fuck?”
      </p>

      <p>“Be a bit civilized,” Gu Fei said calmly.</p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Miao embarrassingly, then turned to Gu
        Fei again. “You knitted it? You also know how to do this?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei answered with a grunt.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng suddenly felt that the impression that he had of Gu Fei in
        his mind had become a blur – a pocket full of candies, a knitted wool
        hat, a murderer, the killer of his own father.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once they were done eating, Gu Fei mounted his bicycle while Gu Miao
        undid the rope that was wrapped around the back of the bicycle, grabbed
        onto it tightly and got on her skateboard.
      </p>

      <p>“Be… careful,” Jiang Cheng didn’t actually know what he should say.</p>

      <p>
        “See you tomorrow,” Gu Fei said before he rode off, pulling Gu Miao from
        behind and disappearing into the crowd in the small street.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng only reacted after he paid the bill,
        <em>see you tomorrow?</em>
      </p>

      <p><em>Is today already over?</em></p>

      <p>　　</p>

      <p>
        Of course, that day wasn’t over since there was still three classes left
        for the afternoon, and to his surprise, Politics occupied two classes.
        Jiang Cheng actually felt extremely sleepy from just seeing that sort of
        schedule.
      </p>

      <p>True to his word, Gu Fei didn’t appear for the whole afternoon.</p>

      <p><em>Well damn, it’s really ‘see you tomorrow’.</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng leaned forward on the table and slept the entire afternoon;
        the advantage in not having Gu Fei there was that Zhou Jing didn’t
        constantly turn around and talk – <em>how peaceful.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The Politics teacher had an even lower sense of existence than Lao Xu
        –the most transparent among all the teachers that he had met that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even when he was teaching on the podium, he needed to constantly
        increase his volume so that his voice could be heard through the
        unscrupulous snoring in the classroom.
      </p>

      <p>In the last class, Pan Zhi sent him a message.</p>

      <p>– As expected, no teacher wanted the self-study class, awesomeeee.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at the teacher on the podium and then replied to Pan
        Zhi.
      </p>

      <p>– It’s awesome here, this class is exactly like the food market.</p>

      <p>
        – Even if it’s peaceful, you’ll still sleep anyways. It’s noisy now, are
        going to sleep huh.
      </p>

      <p>– You don’t know shit.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sighed, Pan Zhi did not understand. Even though he had
        always slept in class, it didn’t mean that he fell asleep every time.
        When he closed his eyes, he would listen to the lecture and when it was
        time to review for an exam, he wouldn’t sleep or cut classes.
      </p>

      <p>
        In such an environment, he was really worried that the quality of this
        <em>xueba</em> would decline.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once the dismissal bell sounded, the classroom was overtaken with noise
        and nearly everyone had instantly packed their own things before
        hurrying to leave while chatting cheerfully along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng gathered his things, grabbed his school bag and left the
        classroom, but when he passed through the hallway, he felt numerous
        lingering eyes. His glanced to the side for a look only to see many
        people leaning against the railing looking at him – he wasn’t sure if
        they were the second-year or third-year students, regardless, there was
        curiosity and analyzation in their eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Tsk.</em> He turned to look for Wang Xu,
        <em
          >that bastard must have said something, probably bragged arrogantly
          about what happened like there’s no tomorrow.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        When he went down the stairs, his cellphone rang; he reckoned that it
        was Pan Zhi, however, it was an unfamiliar number.
      </p>

      <p>“Hello?” he answered the call.</p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng, right? There are goods here for you, come and get them,”
        the other side said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was shocked before he reacted and asked again if it was an
        express delivery, but it was logistics and he had to go and receive it
        himself. He asked for the address and where the things came from and
        then ended the call.
      </p>

      <p>
        His mother had sent them – they should be all the things from his messy
        room over there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before she had prepared a bank card for him and in that moment, she
        attentively sent all his things over, yet she no longer contacted him.
      </p>

      <p>He didn’t know if he should thank her or hate her.</p>

      <p>
        However, his mood couldn’t be considered terrible. It seemed that he had
        already started to become somewhat numb to everything for the past few
        days. When he remembered, there would be a twinge of pain, but it would
        soon pass.
      </p>

      <p>
        He slowly walked back. At this time, Li Baoguo was definitely not at
        home. He might still have to eat alone at night. He pondered while
        walking and finally decided to eat some dumplings, but since he had
        eaten a bit too much at noon, he didn’t feel hungry at all at the
        moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Close to Li Baoguo’s home was a small plaza with several restaurants.
        When Jiang Cheng had walked by before, it looked quite lively with a
        dumpling restaurant that appeared very clean.　
      </p>

      <p>
        To get to the plaza, Jiang Cheng had to go through a small drought
        bridge. When he got closer to the side of the bridge, he glanced over,
        and his footsteps came to a stop.
      </p>

      <p>
        The snow had stopped falling at noon and the afternoon sun was dazzling,
        and even though that bright star had already set, half of the sky was
        still draped with golden brilliant rays that were as faint as veins.
      </p>

      <p>The small bridge was also dyed in warm colors.</p>

      <p>
        In that moment, Jiang Cheng’s heart felt true peacefulness – the
        melancholy brought about by this chaotic day all scattered. He quickened
        his pace onto the bridge, thinking that if he was half an hour earlier,
        it would have been even more beautiful there.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was probably the most beautiful place that he had seen in this
        rotten city.
      </p>

      <p>
        There weren’t many people on the bridge, and when he approached the
        center, he saw someone ahead holding a camera – probably taking pictures
        of the bridge and the sky.
      </p>

      <p>He saw the profile… no, he knew it just from the legs.</p>

      <p>It was Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        It was not unexpected to recognize Gu Fei, what was unexpected was that
        Gu Fei, who had cut all the afternoon classes, was there, and he had a
        professional-grade camera and camera bag.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>No wonder he refused to lend the camera to Zhou Jing.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng hesitated on whether he should go over or move to the other
        side and pretend to not have seen Gu Fei, either way, they didn’t have
        anything to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he was about to take a step, Gu Fei probably finished taking
        pictures since he turned and was walking to where he was.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if he pretended not to have seen him, it was too late now. Jiang
        Cheng sighed and forged ahead.Just when he was about to greet him – even
        though he had nothing in particular to say – Gu Fei saw him. After he
        paused for a second, he faced him and lifted the camera in his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was in utter shock and didn’t have time to cover his face
        when he heard the sound of the shutter.
      </p>

      <p><em>Click.</em></p>

      <p>
        <em>Fuck your uncle ah!</em>
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true"></p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “The fuck, what are you blindly taking photos of!” Jiang Cheng swore,
        and since our little friend Gu Miao wasn’t present at the moment, it was
        of no importance whether he was civilized or not.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Gu Fei did not speak and continued to click the camera in Jiang Cheng’s
        direction.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng felt as though all the unpleasant expressions on his face
        were forcefully frozen in time.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “I’m asking you a question!” He walked in front of Gu Fei and reached
        out his hand in an attempt to grab the camera.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Gu Fei swiftly shifted the camera backward: “Two hundred sixty-seven
        years old.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “What?” Jiang Cheng froze with confusion, “What two hundred sixty… how
        much?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Two hundred sixty-seven,” Gu Fei repeated once again.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “What’s two hundred sixty-seven years old?” Jiang Cheng asked.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Xiao Ming’s grandfather,” Gu Fei replied.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng stared back at him for some solid thirty seconds, unsure of
        whether he himself was speechless or trying desperately to repress the
        laughter that was building up inside.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        In the end, he pointed toward Gu Fei’s camera: “Give it to me or delete
        it.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Why don’t you take a look first?” Gu Fei handed him the camera.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng suddenly became nervous when he took over the camera, it was
        dead heavy and he felt that if he wasn’t careful enough, it would smash
        onto the ground. But he was then put to great confusion after he saw the
        cluster of buttons on the camera.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Not to mention deleting, even if it was to browse through all the
        photos, he didn’t know where to press.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Here.” Gu Fei reached over and pressed on the camera icon, which made
        the photos appear on the screen.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        There was a total of four photos as Jiang Cheng silently flipped through
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        He never developed much interest in photography, no matter if it was
        himself taking photos of the landscape or others taking photos of him –
        he would rather use his eyes to look.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though he normally felt like he was quite handsome, he would still
        be accidentally scared off his heels by the front camera every time…
        however, the person displayed in Gu Fei’s camera was unexpectedly –
        quite that.
      </p>

      <p><em>Quite accurately portrayed, en.</em></p>

      <p>
        The ferocious expression he worried about was not at all present – only
        a hint of annoyance was shown.
      </p>

      <p>And the first photo – he surprisingly liked it very much.</p>

      <p>
        The chaotic yet desolate backdrop that had been blurred out of focus
        presented itself with a faint melancholic sensitivity, causing his brain
        to suddenly think of the sentence – my home elsewhere – for no reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        And he, who walked toward the camera under the radiance of the setting
        sun… there was not much to say except his handsomeness was off the
        charts.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he flipped through the photos, Jiang Cheng was unsure of what he
        should do next.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The button on the bottom right corner is the delete button,” Gu Fei
        said.
      </p>

      <p>“I know,” Jiang Cheng answered somewhat awkwardly.</p>

      <p>
        The person saying to delete it was himself, but the very same person
        wanting to go back on his words after seeing the photos was also
        himself. After all, no photos of him were ever taken with such intense
        feels.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the last Lunar New Year, his family actually went to a
        photography studio to have a family portrait taken. Originally thinking
        it should have turned out quite well, in the end, when the photo was
        printed Jiang Cheng almost ripped it to pieces. Because of this matter,
        he even got into another argument with his parents and didn’t return
        home for two days…
      </p>

      <p>
        His thought seemed to have drifted too far. Jiang Cheng backtracked his
        train of thought and looked at Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re quite photogenic,” Gu Fei said. “If you don’t mind, I want to
        keep it – I took a lot of photos of our classmates and kept them all.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The ladder<sup> <a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> </sup>that Gu Fei gave was
        right on time, Jiang Cheng hesitated for a second: “What do you do with
        these many portraits?”
      </p>

      <p>“It’s fun,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        “… oh,” Jiang Cheng nodded. Having the ability to perfectly kill every
        conversation was indeed something admirable about Gu Fei. “Photography
        lover.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How about I friend you on WeChat later,” Gu Fei took out his phone.
        “I’ll clean up the photos and send you a copy?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng very much wanted to decline –
        <em>I’m not interested in that stuff.</em>
      </p>

      <p>But as he opened his mouth, he ended up nodding his head: “Oh.”</p>

      <p>
        With the camera still in his hand, Jiang Cheng wasn’t sure what to do
        after he “oh-ed”. Gu Fei didn’t make a sound either, apparently, he was
        quite accustomed to this sort of restrained awkward silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Can I look through some other photos?” Jiang Cheng asked. He was still
        unable to form a connection between Gu Fei and this kickass professional
        camera.
      </p>

      <p>“Sure,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        The majority of the photographs were of bridges and sunsets. From the
        rays of light, one could see that Gu Fei spent the majority of his
        afternoons here, and there were many photos – some were of the
        landscape, some were also of the people walking across the bridge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had no eye for photography, but whether a photo was good or
        not, he could still distinguish.
      </p>

      <p>
        The photos Gu Fei took were very professional, the structural
        composition and color palette drew an air of warmth from its
        surroundings. If it wasn’t for the fact that Jiang Cheng was standing in
        the exact same spot and feeling the beating of the old northern winds
        against his body, then just by looking at the photo would indeed make
        one feel just as comfortable as sitting against the warmth of a furnace.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he continued to flip through, the photos were probably not ones from
        today.
      </p>

      <p>Most of them were streetscapes.</p>

      <p>
        Trees and old houses, snow piles and stray dogs, fallen leaves and the
        feet of passing pedestrians… extraordinarily mundane yet neglected
        objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he was about to classify this as Gu Fei’s photographing style, a
        picture of a hunched down Gu Miao with her hand grabbing onto the
        skateboard and leaping into the bright, sun-lit sky caused him to
        uncontrollably let out “ah” in amazement.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En?” Gu Fei was leaning against the bridge railings smoking a
        cigarette; he turned his head after hearing Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This one really has the feels, Gu Miao is so cool,” Jiang Cheng turned
        over the camera screen to face Gu Fei. “A little flying ninja.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei smiled: “It was a captured shot, she flew a few dozen times
        before I finally captured this one.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at him for a moment longer. Gu Fei’s personality was
        quite difficult to typecast, he normally displayed an air of ‘nothing is
        my business, my stepmother is an alien, and I’m a conversation killer’,
        but during those times when he was with Gu Miao or at the mention of Gu
        Miao, his demeanor would then also soften.
      </p>

      <p><em>Very motherly.</em></p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng remembered Gu Miao’s wool-knitted hat.</p>

      <p>
        <em
          >A thread in the hands of her loving brother…<a href="#_ftn2"
            >[2]</a
          ></em
        >
      </p>

      <p>And this scene was even paired with a soundtrack.</p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Wake up and make love with me, wake up and make love…<a href="#_ftn3"
            >[3]</a
          ></em
        >
      </p>

      <p>Except the soundtrack was seemingly somewhat unfitting.</p>

      <p>“Your phone is ringing,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng handed the camera back to him, fished out his phone in
        a slightly awkward manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng Cheng, ah?” Li Baoguo’s explosive voice passed through from the
        other end.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What… did you call me?” The goosebumps on Jiang Cheng’s body rose and
        fell like the rolling waves.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei most likely heard it and even though he quickly turned his head
        away, Jiang Cheng was still able to see the smile on the side of his
        face.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck.</em></p>

      <p>
        “Are you almost home yet?” Li Baoguo asked. “Hurry and come back, your
        older brother and sister came home, they’re waiting for you to come back
        and start dinner!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng suddenly felt a wave of dreariness – not only because
        the plan to go eat dumplings fell through, but also because he was
        pulled back to reality and had to face the people who he would never
        have had crossed path yet became family with. He suddenly couldn’t move
        his legs, “I know.”
      </p>

      <p>“Are you going back?” Gu Fei asked after he put away his camera.</p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng responded.</p>

      <p>“Let’s go together. I’m going home too,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“Driving?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“…I walked over here.” Gu Fei looked at him.</p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng turned and started to walk back.</p>

      <p>
        After sunset, the temperature started to drop drastically, and the two
        stalked back while pushing against the old northern winds.
      </p>

      <p>
        When their body warmed up from moments of walking, Jiang Cheng turned
        over and looked at Gu Fei: “Do you know Li Baoguo?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “People from those surrounding streets all more or less know one
        another,” Gu Fei replied. “Grandpas, grandmas, uncles, aunts, brothers,
        and sisters… we’re all old acquaintances in this neighborhood.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh, then… what kind of a person is he?” Jiang Cheng continued to ask.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei pulled on his hat and turned his head: “What is he to you?”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was unsure of how to answer this. He pulled up the face mask
        that was bunched under his chin and covered a large fraction of his face
        – only then did he relax a bit.
      </p>

      <p>“My… birth father,” he answered.</p>

      <p>
        “En?” Gu Fei raised his eyebrows in surprise. “Biological father? Li
        Baoguo has two sons? But now that you mention it… you and Li Hui do look
        somewhat alike.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know,” Jiang Cheng answered in annoyance. “It’s what I was
        told… I’m just asking you what kind of a person he is, can you answer me
        straightforwardly?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Senior gambler.” This time, Gu Fei answered bluntly. “Professional
        drunkard.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng’s footsteps halted slightly.</p>

      <p>“Still wanna hear more?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“What else?” Jiang Cheng sighed lightly.</p>

      <p>
        “Domestic abuse – it chased his wife away.” Gu Fei gave some more
        thought, “That’s about the main ones.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s already quite enough,” Jiang Cheng bunched his eyebrows together
        and after some hesitation, he looked toward Gu Fei, “Are these
        reliable?”
      </p>

      <p>“You don’t find these reliable?” Gu Fei smiled.</p>

      <p>
        “These street stall rumors seem rather…” Jiang Cheng did not finish,
        <em
          >these street stall rumors also implied that you killed your own
          dad.</em
        >
        But he could not say this out loud, no matter what the hidden truth was
        – Gu Fei’s father’s death was a reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This isn’t gossip,” Gu Fei continued. “You return home every day, do
        you not see him playing cards.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng suddenly lost all will to continue the conversation.
        　　
      </p>

      <p>
        After they reached the intersection in total silence, Gu Fei turned to
        walk toward the direction of his house. Jiang Cheng didn’t have the
        heart to say goodbye, but neither did Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>He pulled on his mask and walked toward Li Baoguo’s house.</p>

      <p>
        From miles away, a quarrel could be heard. The squabble was quite fierce
        and was also combined with both men and women.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he approached the source of the sound, he could finally see that it
        was coming from the building beside Li Baoguo’s apartment. Under the
        building stood a man and a woman, behind the second-floor window also
        stood a man and a woman.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng couldn’t hear the reason for the quarrel, but the members
        from both teams were earnestly swearing at each other – words clearly
        articulated.
      </p>

      <p>
        All sorts of reproductive systems and indescribable scenes were spat
        out, certain vocabularies were sometimes recycled and reused. Jiang
        Cheng even felt embarrassed for them as they passed through his ear.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he arrived under the building, the man on the second floor suddenly
        appeared in front of the window with a pot, Jiang Cheng looked up and
        quickly jumped aside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Immediately following, the pot of water filled with vegetable leaves
        poured out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though Jiang Cheng was not drenched, his body <em>was</em> splashed
        with water. Instantly, he was coated by a strong air of disgust, strong
        enough that his mask was almost blasted away.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you sick?! What a bunch of idiots!” He shouted. “If you have the
        guts, go outside and have a fight with your fists! Don’t waste what
        little skills you have on being a shrew! Coward!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t look at the people around him after his outroar, he
        simply turned and entered the corridor inside.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wasn’t sure if those people were momentarily shocked or unable to
        understand what he had just blared out, but nonetheless, both sides
        lowered their volume and quietly finished off their quarrel with a few
        more swears – just like this, the fight abruptly ended.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng patted away the water, there were even a few nail-sized
        lettuce leaves. <em>Fuck!</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he fished out the keys, the door to Li Baoguo’s house opened. Li
        Baoguo stuck out his head, revealing a face full of radiance: “Was that
        you just now?”
      </p>

      <p>“What?” Jiang Cheng answered in a throaty, glum mood.</p>

      <p>
        “That was some good cursing,” Li Baoguo said with a smile. “You are
        exactly how my son should be like.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t try to catch on to the conversation, instead, he
        walked past and entered the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        The room was still as ruined as before, but that day there was an added
        air of estrangement.
      </p>

      <p>
        A table full of food, along with two men, two women and three children
        sitting down. Huddled around the table, they filled the small living
        room to its maximum.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Come, Cheng Cheng,” Li Baoguo closed the door and very affectionately
        lifted an arm to wrap around his shoulders. “Let me introduce you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng extremely despised his shoulders being touched by unfamiliar
        people – it was only with gritted teeth that he refrained from throwing
        his arm away.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This is your older brother Li Hui, the eldest,” Li Baoguo pointed
        toward a man of twenty-six to twenty-seven years of age, and then to the
        younger woman on the side. “This is your sister-in-law, those two are
        your nephews… come here, call him uncle!”
      </p>

      <p>
        The two little boys watching TV on the side simultaneously turned their
        heads in Jiang Cheng’s direction, but as if they hadn’t heard a thing,
        they turned their heads away.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey! Little bastards! I’m telling you to address your uncle!” Li Baoguo
        yelled out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those two children didn’t even bother to turn their heads this time.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You guys…” Li Baoguo pointed at them as if wanting to continue but was
        then unsure of what else to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No worries, we’re unfamiliar with each other,” Jiang Cheng patted his
        arm. He only wanted to be quickly freed from Li Baoguo’s loud voice and
        flying spit as well as the arm around his shoulders that was causing his
        whole body to stiffen.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll come back for you guys later!” Li Baoguo then pointed toward the
        other woman, “This is your older sister, Li Qing, this is your
        brother-in-law…. your niece, call him uncle!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Uncle.” A four to five years old little girl standing to the side
        addressed him with a low voice as if she got frightened.
      </p>

      <p>“Hello,” Jiang Cheng forced out a smile.</p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo finally released him. Jiang Cheng left a few words telling
        them he was going to change his clothes and quickly disappeared into his
        own bedroom. Once the door closed, he leaned against the door and closed
        his eyes. 　
      </p>

      <p>
        Since the moment he walked through the door, with the exception of Li
        Baoguo, no one else in the room full of people offered him a single
        trace of a smile on their faces.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Li Baoguo introduced them one by one, everyone only nodded their
        heads and not a word was uttered.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this form of aloofness was not because he was unwelcomed nor any
        other disdain; rather, it was a natural reaction formed from blankness
        and numbness.
      </p>

      <p>Even more horrendous was the pressurizing atmosphere.</p>

      <p>
        In just a short span of two minutes, Jiang Chang already had
        difficulties breathing.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took off his coat, and with a hand on the wall to support himself, he
        breathed in a few lungs full of air, slowly exhaling then inhaling then
        exhaling again and finally letting out a light sigh.
      </p>

      <p>
        He couldn’t even remember how many times he sighed within these few
        days, probably enough to blow a welcoming balloon.
      </p>

      <p>
        After staying in his room for several minutes, Li Baoguo started to
        loudly call for him from the other side. Jiang Cheng rubbed his face and
        had no choice but to open the door and walk out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone in the room had already taken a seat around the dining table,
        those two little bastards who were only able to focus on the TV were
        also seated – and not only seated – they had already started eating,
        using their hands to grab the ribs into their bowl and gnawing on them.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s eat,” Li Qing said and reached out a hand to pick up the bowl in
        front of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Thank you, I can do it myself,” Jiang Cheng quickly picked up the bowl.
        “You go ahead and eat.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let her fill it,” Li Baoguo stood to the side and said. “These sorts of
        things are meant to be done by women.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng froze, Li Qing took the bowl from his hand and moved to the
        side where the pot was and filled his bowl with rice.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Come, we have to have a drink today.” Li Baoguo lifted up two bottles
        of alcohol from the floor, most likely brought along by Li Qing or Li
        Hui. But before Jiang Cheng could tell what alcohol it was, he had
        already opened the cabinet door beside him and put the bottles inside.
        Then from the cabinet, he took out another bottle, “I brewed this
        myself, quills fruit wine.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just drink the two bottles Li Qing brought,” Li Hui seemed somewhat
        discontent. “You always bring out this rotten wine of yours to show off,
        it tastes like dishwater.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Li Baoguo put down the wine bottle on the table, “You think that
        your old geezer’s wine is an abhorrence? If you’re against it then bring
        your own wine too, why come empty-handed and still be picky?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Dad, what are you saying,” sister-in-law started, her tone full of
        discontent. “Your son comes for a visit and you’re still critical of
        whether he brought back things or not.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You shut up!” Li Baoguo bulged his eyes, “Since when did this household
        give a woman a turn to speak!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s wrong with a woman?!” Sister-in-law raised her voice, “Without
        me as a woman, where would you get yourself two grandsons? Are you
        counting on your daughter to birth you grandsons? She’s not even able to
        give birth to any grandchild!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt himself fall into a state of utter shock, shocked that
        this family could start a fight from such simple conversations, shocked
        that they could fight over a dinner that was supposed to demonstrate
        family harmony and seeing Li Qing and her husband sitting in utter
        silence shocked him even more.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I have grandsons because I have a son!” Li Baoguo’s voice was loud
        enough to vibrate the light fixture on the ceiling, “I now have one more
        son. If I want grandsons, it’s only a matter of minutes! Li Hui, are you
        a man or not, your wife is behaving in such a sordid manner and yet you
        can’t even say shit back!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What is there to fuss about!” Li Hui slammed his chopsticks down on the
        table and stood up. It was unclear who this sentence was directed toward
        – Li Baoguo or his wife.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why ask me? Do you not know what we’re fighting about!” Sister-in-law’s
        voice rose to a shrilling volume.
      </p>

      <p>
        When this sounds escaped from her throat, the two little bastards who
        had their hands in the food simultaneously raised their heads toward the
        ceiling and burst out wailing. It sounded as if someone had triggered
        the alarm, causing people’s brains to tingle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stood up, went back to his own room and closed the door
        behind him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The argument on the other side was still going on, men were yelling,
        women were screaming, and children freed their vocal cords to bawl –
        sadly, the battered door could do nothing to hold back these voices that
        could make anyone fall into despair.
      </p>

      <p>
        Behind the thin panel of wood stood his real family, the kind of family
        that was annoying to watch even in television dramas. They were the type
        of people that he always looked down on, no, not even ‘looked-down on’,
        it’s more like the type of people whom he never would have paid
        attention to.
      </p>

      <p>
        If he had grown up in this environment, would he have been just like
        them?
      </p>

      <p>
        His own explosive nature, his longer-than-usual rebellious phase – was
        this all genetically inherited?
      </p>

      <p>Was this written in his genes?</p>

      <p>A rebellious phase? Maybe there never was any rebellious phase.</p>

      <p>But instead, his terrifying nature. 　</p>

      <p>
        Someone knocked on the door behind his back, the people outside were
        still fighting, he even heard the sound of someone kicking over a chair.
        If it wasn’t for the fact that he was leaning against the door, he
        wouldn’t have been able to hear this wispy knock.
      </p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng?” Li Qing’s voice sounded, equally soft.</p>

      <p>
        He hesitated for a few seconds, then turned and opened the door to a
        crack, looking back at Li Qing who stood outside the door with
        uneasiness.
      </p>

      <p>“Are you okay?” Li Qing asked.</p>

      <p>“I’m fine,” Jiang Cheng answered.</p>

      <p>
        Are <em>you </em>okay? This sentence should be more appropriately
        directed toward Li Qing.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That…” Li Qing turned back to gaze at the foul atmosphere in the living
        room, “How about I bring in some dishes for you to eat inside?”
      </p>

      <p>“No, thanks,” Jiang Cheng replied. “I really…. can’t stomach it.”</p>

      <p>
        Li Qing did not continue to speak; he then closed the door again and
        locked it.
      </p>

      <p>
        After dazedly standing in the center of the room for a while, he walked
        toward the window, with his hands on the clasp he tried to turn it.
      </p>

      <p>The window did not budge.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had been trying to open this very window since the day he
        arrived, yet not once had he succeeded. This window seemed to have been
        welded shut, refusing to budge even the width of a hairline.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng furiously attempted to turn the clasp with a few more tries,
        in the end, he started to push.
      </p>

      <p>He did not succeed even when he broke out in sweats.</p>

      <p>
        Staring at the window panel, listening to the chaos occurring outside,
        he could only feel as if something within him was about to explode.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned to grab the chair behind him and fiercely flung it toward the
        window.
      </p>

      <p>The glass window broke at an enormously piercing volume.</p>

      <p>
        This sound made Jiang Cheng feel very comfortable, all the pores on his
        body instantly opened. He once again lifted the chair and smashed again.
      </p>

      <p>
        The glass shattered into bits with the broken pieces scattering onto the
        floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        He smashed, again and again – the bickering noises in the living room
        turned into smashes against the door, but he was reluctant to listen.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the glass was completely broken, he aimed at the window frame and
        kicked.
      </p>

      <p>The window finally opened</p>

      <p>
        The sounds of keys turning transmitted from the other side of the door.
        With one hand on the windowsill for support, he jumped out.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck biological.</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p></p>

      <p>
        The moment he jumped out of the window, the cold wind poured into his
        breath, squeezed into his pores and finally penetrated inside his body.
      </p>

      <p>It felt amazing.</p>

      <p>
        The broken glass that fell under the windowsill made a few short and
        crisp sounds beneath his feet – Jiang Cheng felt that his feeling of
        suffocation had finally disappeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sky outside was a complete blanket of darkness with no streetlights.
        The moon had gone somewhere unknown, leaving only the faint light that
        was visible from the windows of various households, which made it
        possible to vaguely see that this was the back of the building that had
        not been cleared of a large area of snow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng fished his cell phone out of his pocket and turned on the
        flashlight before treading ahead through the snow with deep and light
        steps, from the back of the building to the end of a small street.
      </p>

      <p>Ahead was some sort of small factory with no road there.</p>

      <p>He stopped and stood in the darkness.</p>

      <p>
        After the immense outburst, he slowly calmed down in the cold wind and
        was now somewhat at a loss.
      </p>

      <p><em>Where should I go?</em></p>

      <p><em>What should I do?</em></p>

      <p><em>With no goal or a purpose.</em></p>

      <p>
        He looked down at the time on his phone and pondered on what he should
        do now.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>It’s too fucking cold, shit. </em>He had actually forgotten to put
        on a jacket when he jumped out.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a trace of a dirty smear on the phone screen. He used his
        fingers to rub at it, unfortunately, not only was the previous trace not
        erased, but a new one was added.
      </p>

      <p>
        The highly dark surroundings were the culprits in making it nearly
        impossible for him to clearly see what it was, and he could only vaguely
        feel that his fingers were wet.
      </p>

      <p>
        But soon he reacted and quickly turn the phone screen toward his own
        fingers and searched.
      </p>

      <p>Blood.</p>

      <p>“Fuck,” he said in a low voice.</p>

      <p>It was a bit frightening – a bloody hand.</p>

      <p>
        The bitter cold hand had gone somewhat numb, he couldn’t feel the pain
        at all; he even looked until he found the cut in the center of his palm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Quite deep – the blood was still gushing without a sign of stopping.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng searched around in both of his pants pockets yet couldn’t
        even find a scrap of paper – all he could do was pull down the corner of
        his sweater and firmly held onto it at his palm.
      </p>

      <p>Such a cold day did not actually freeze the wound up.</p>

      <p><em>… that’s right, such a cold day.</em></p>

      <p>He didn’t even have a jacket.</p>

      <p><em>Shit!</em></p>

      <p>　　</p>

      <p>
        It was only until this moment that Jiang Cheng seemed to have been
        suddenly roused by the bone-chilling coldness.
      </p>

      <p>No coat, no money, and endlessly flowing blood.</p>

      <p>
        He assessed the direction and ran to the junction of the small street to
        the side; Li Baoguo had mentioned that there was a community hospital
        over there where you could ask someone to help bind up a wound first and
        stay warm.
      </p>

      <p>
        After running for a few steps, he could barely endure the cold – the
        running changed into hopping and skipping, soon he couldn’t even feel
        the warmth of his own breath.
      </p>

      <p><em>It’s so fucking cold!</em></p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo had said that that community hospital was not particularly
        obvious – he actually was not wrong; it was far more unclear, and Jiang
        Cheng only saw it when he ran over.
      </p>

      <p>Even the lights weren’t turned on.</p>

      <p><em>… the lights aren’t turned on?</em></p>

      <p>He was stunned, <em>the lights aren’t turned on.</em></p>

      <p>
        Only when he squinted his eyes to look at the front door did he see a
        sign hanging there. The bitter cold had made his eyes tremble
        involuntarily, and as he got closer for a better look; the general idea
        was that the doctor had returned home for dinner.
      </p>

      <p>“… no way!” He knocked on the door twice but there was no response.</p>

      <p>
        There was a phone number on the sign, but he didn’t call it. If he
        actually did, he would have to wait for the doctor to come back; he
        reckoned by then, he would have already frozen to death.
      </p>

      <p>He scrunched his eyebrows and turned to look to the side.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s family shop was about five meters in distance from there and
        the lights were on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although he was very much reluctant to have Gu Fei see him in a sorry
        state again… it was just too fucking cold!
      </p>

      <p>
        He hopped over there, opened the door to the shop and lifted up the
        curtain.
      </p>

      <p>
        The warmth that struck him in the face made his entirely stiff body and
        cramped tendons relax almost immediately.
      </p>

      <p>But then he caught himself and stared blankly – somewhat awkward.</p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know the reason for why he always felt a sense of awkwardness
        every time he entered Gu Fei’s shop.
      </p>

      <p>
        The space where ‘Bu Shi Hao Niao’ sat in last time now had a small table
        there, and on there was an electric stove cooking something – a pot that
        was braving the heat… it was probably lamb meat soup, he could smell it.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei was in the process of giving Gu Miao a ladle of soup.</p>

      <p>
        And in the position directly facing the door was a woman, over twenty
        years of age or so.
      </p>

      <p>
        Apart from the slightly large disparity in age, they looked like a
        family of three, and that made Jiang Cheng suddenly feel as though he
        did not appear at a good time at all.　
      </p>

      <p>
        “You…” Gu Fei twisted his head around only to be taken aback when he saw
        him. “What’s going on?”
      </p>

      <p>“Can you not ask?” Jiang Cheng said, “I just… passed by.”</p>

      <p>“Your friend?” The woman looked at Gu Fei and asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei stood up and walked up to Jiang Cheng, his gaze dropping
        down to his hand.
      </p>

      <p>The woman also stood up: “What’s the matter…”</p>

      <p>“The first-aid kit,” Gu Fei turned and said.</p>

      <p>“En.” She quickly walked into the small room.</p>

      <p>
        Meanwhile, Gu Miao sat completely still at the side of the table with a
        spoon held tightly in her hand. Her eyes widened, somewhat looking
        anxiously over there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng noticed that Gu Fei had moved a bit closer to him, blocking
        the center of Gu Miao’s line of sight – he in turn, quickly brought his
        hand to his back to hide it.
      </p>

      <p>“Go into the room,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng quickened his steps into the small room, the woman had
        already brought out the first-aid kit and when she saw him, she said
        softly: “Hand?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng replied, “The community hospital…”</p>

      <p>
        “The doctor always eats at this time,” the woman said. “Is it serious?
        I’ll help you clean up first, disinfect the wound.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s not serious,” Jiang Cheng looked at the medical kit, everything
        seemed to be there. “I can do it myself.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just one hand requires a lot more effort <em>ah</em>,” the woman
        laughed. “It’s faster if I help you treat it.”
      </p>

      <p>“Is it a knife wound?” Gu Fei asked as he entered.</p>

      <p>
        “No,” Jiang Cheng hesitated for a moment and loosened the hand that had
        been gripping the sweater.
      </p>

      <p>
        After loosening his hand, he was utterly shocked at the sight – the
        sweater had already been dyed with a large area of bloodstain.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You…” Gu Fei frowned as he looked at his hand and then glanced toward
        the sweater before saying to the woman: “Let me do it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s fine, would I actually be scared by this little wound,” the woman
        smiled and pushed him. “You can just go and keep Gu Miao company, I can
        see that she was very anxious just now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En …” Gu Fei hesitated for a moment, then turned and walked out, but he
        stopped after two steps and turned his head to introduce the two. “My
        classmate, Jiang Cheng. This is my older sister, Ding Zhuxin.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can just call me Xin-<em>jie<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></em
        >,” Ding Zhuxin laughed and pulled Jiang Cheng’s hand over. “Let me take
        a look… the wound seems to be quite deep ah…”　
      </p>

      <p>“Really?” Jiang Cheng responded.</p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Zhuxin? This name wasn’t skillfully thought of – the core of bamboo
          is hollow.<a href="#_ftn2"><strong>[2]</strong></a></em
        ><sup></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng expressed mild confusion toward the emergence of his rather
        sudden artistic train of thought that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I will use saline to clean it up for you first,” Ding Zhuxin said.
        “Then use iodine in a bit.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng nodded, “Thank you.”</p>

      <p>“Don’t mention it,” Ding Zhuxin said smiling.</p>

      <p>
        With the temperature in the room having been set on high, his body soon
        warmed up, but the pain from the wound seemed to have also awakened and
        started to hurt tremendously.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Ding Zhuxin helped him clean the blood on his hand, he found that
        the gash was indeed not small.
      </p>

      <p>“Must’ve been cut by glass huh,” Ding Zhuxin said. “How careless.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng didn’t speak.</p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Gu Fei’s older sister surname is Ding? Did she take the mom’s
          surname?</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        And although Ding Zhuxin was very beautiful and had an unearthly pale
        skin that was nearly transparent, from Jiang Cheng’s perspective, the
        long and thick lashes covered her eyes – but it was completely different
        from Gu Fei and Gu Miao.
      </p>

      <p>“You’re Gu Fei’s older sister?” he asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Not biological,” Ding Zhuxin laughed. “He calls me sister, I used to
        live in the apartment above his family’s.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng also laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “I watched him grow up, and as a kid, he was my follower.” After Ding
        Zhuxin applied the iodine for him, she took out the gauze from the
        first-aid kit and covered the wound. “You can only leave it like this
        first, wrap it and then have the doctor take a look at it later.”
      </p>

      <p>“Thanks,” Jiang Cheng stood up.</p>

      <p>
        “Why are you always saying thanks?” Ding Zhuxin said casually as she put
        away everything into the first-aid kit. “Whenever I help Da Fei with his
        wounds, he has never said thank you.”
      </p>

      <p><em>He really doesn’t have any manners.</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng said to himself – thinking about it again, perhaps they were
        too comfortable in each other’s presence.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he came in, although Ding Zhuxin only said a few words to Gu Fei,
        he could sense that they were very familiar with each other – especially
        after Ding Zhuxin turned her face to the side, Jiang Cheng saw a small
        musical note on her earlobe…
      </p>

      <p><em>Sister? Tsk.</em></p>

      <p>
        He didn’t expect Gu Fei to have this kind of preference… no matter how
        you look at this woman, she was at least four to five years older.
      </p>

      <p>
        “So, you’re Da Fei’s classmate?” Ding Zhuxin asked. “It seems I haven’t
        seen you before… but then again, he doesn’t have much to do with his
        classmates.”
      </p>

      <p>“I just transferred over,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>“It’s like that huh,” Ding Zhuxin glanced at him.</p>

      <p>“All better now?” Gu Fei pushed open the door.</p>

      <p>
        “All better,” Ding Zhuxin said. “Just have Dr. Zhang take a look at it
        when he returns.”
      </p>

      <p>“Is the wound deep?” Gu Fei asked again.</p>

      <p>“How deep can it be with just one cut,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “Er Miao wants me to ask ‘Cheng-<em>ge</em>, have you eaten yet?’” Gu
        Fei glanced out.
      </p>

      <p>“… not yet,” Jiang Cheng answered somewhat depressingly.</p>

      <p>
        “That’s perfect, let’s eat together,” Ding Zhuxin said. As she walked
        out, her hand landed naturally on Gu Fei’s shoulder. “I was just saying
        I bought too much lamb meat today, the two of them wouldn’t be able to
        finish it all.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Isn’t it inconvenient?” Jiang Cheng hesitated and lowered his voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s inconvenient?” Gu Fei didn’t comprehend what he meant but still
        subconsciously followed him in reducing his volume.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Umm…” Jiang Cheng quickly cast a glance at Ding Zhuxin’s back, “Your
        sister.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was stunned and then leaned back on the door frame with a hint of
        a smile at the corner of his mouth. “Oh.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh?” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “It’s not inconvenient, isn’t Er Miao also there.” Gu Fei went inside
        the room, took out a sweater from the cabinet and threw it on the bed.
        “Change out of that, she’ll be scared.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After Gu Fei walked out, he picked up the sweater and checked out the
        size, <em>good enough</em>, and then he changed into it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then he looked down and analyzed it,
        <em>this sweater shouldn’t have been knitted by Gu Fei, right…</em>
      </p>

      <p>“Need help?” Gu Fei shouted from the other side.</p>

      <p>
        “No need!” He replied quickly and folded the clothes he had changed out
        of before placing them on the chair next to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as he walked out of the room, the thick aroma of lamb soup that
        pervaded the inside of the shop immediately attacked his nostrils –
        Jiang Cheng’s hunger was of such intensity that his heart shook with
        anxiousness.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Smells good huh,” Ding Zhuxin was putting a ladle of soup in a bowl.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng walked over and sat down at the side of the small
        table.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This is the very first time I’ve ever seen Er Miao want someone to stay
        to eat – what a great improvement after having not been here for two
        months!” Ding Zhuxin picked up two pieces of lamb meat and placed them
        in Gu Miao’s bowl, “Jiang Cheng, have you transferred here for a long
        time? Was it last semester?”
      </p>

      <p>“This semester,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “Ah,” Ding Zhuxin looked at him for a good few seconds, then laughed and
        placed a bowl of soup in front of him. “How unexpected.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao drank the soup while secretly glancing at the gauze around Jiang
        Cheng’s hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s fine now,” Gu Fei grabbed Jiang Cheng’s hand and put it before
        her. “Look.”　
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was injured on the right hand – the chopsticks were already
        being held with unsteadiness; with that sudden grab, the chopsticks flew
        out of his hand and fell to the floor.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao very carefully touched his hand lightly.</p>

      <p>
        “Let go,” Ding Zhuxin gave Gu Fei’s hand a slap and then picked up the
        chopsticks. “His hand is still injured yet you grabbed it so violently.”
      </p>

      <p>“I’ll go wash it,” Gu Fei reached out to get the chopsticks.</p>

      <p>“I’ll go…” Jiang Cheng wanted to stand up.</p>

      <p>
        “You two can just sit down, it’s not like I’m eating.” Ding Zhuxin got
        up and walked out the back door.
      </p>

      <p>
        “She’s not eating?” Jiang Cheng was shocked, just now realizing that
        there were only three bowls and three pairs of chopsticks on the table –
        a sense of awkwardness mixed with embarrassment struck him. It should
        not be that there were <em>only </em>three bowls and three pairs of
        chopsticks altogether but then adding him, there wasn’t enough?!
      </p>

      <p>
        “She doesn’t eat at night, it’s been like that for many years.” Gu Fei
        gave him his chopsticks, “I haven’t used them.”
      </p>

      <p>“I’m not in a rush,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “You’re really not in a rush?” Gu Fei tilted his head to the side and
        looked at him, “I feel like your gaze has become dead from hunger.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck off.” Jiang Cheng took his chopsticks, picked up a piece of lamb,
        and ate it.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was probably really due to the acute hunger that out of nowhere, this
        piece of lamb meat immediately topped the three most delicious food he
        had eaten in the last two years.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Ding Zhuxin returned and saw the chopsticks in Jiang Cheng’s hand,
        she froze, then placed the clean chopsticks in front of Gu Fei. She said
        lightly: “I’m leaving ah.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei stood up and grabbed her coat from behind the checkout
        counter for her.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re not going to eat a bit? It’s very… delicious.” Jiang Cheng also
        stood and said even though he didn’t know what to say exactly, and after
        he did say it, he felt even more awkward.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You guys can just eat it – eat a bit more.” Ding Zhuxin laughed and put
        on her coat. “I’m on a diet.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng hesitated for a moment but then sat back down only to
        see Gu Miao pointing at the pot of meat. He nodded his head, “I’ll get
        it for you.”
      </p>

      <p>However, Gu Miao then pointed at his empty bowl.</p>

      <p>
        “I’m… not in a rush.” Jiang Cheng felt a bit embarrassed – he was hungry
        to such an extent that even the little girl could see it, so in order to
        show that he was not in a rush, he had to turn his head to look at Gu
        Fei and Ding Zhuxin.
      </p>

      <p>“Keys,” Ding Zhuxin reached out her hand toward Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        “Aren’t you cold?” Gu Fei asked, fishing his motorcycle keys out of his
        pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        “When I was street-racing, you were still occupied with studying all the
        way from primary to junior middle school.” Ding Zhuxin took the keys,
        turned around and left the shop.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei followed behind to the door for a glance and then returned to sit
        back down.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Ding Zhuxin left, Jiang Cheng was inexplicably relieved. This was
        indeed the first time he felt such a strong sense of awkwardness with a
        girl around.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ding Zhuxin was very beautiful, also it was the kind of beauty that was
        emphatically not unassuming and not aggressive. Ordinarily, he would
        look a little longer if he were to come across that kind of appearance
        on the street.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he picked up the meat, his hand was still hurting. He did not dare to
        use much strength; looking at his own posture, it looked like he was
        about to explode, afraid that if his hand tremble even the slightest,
        the meat would drop on the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took a big colander spoon from the side, put it in the pot and
        scooped out a large spoonful of lamb and passed it over to Jiang Cheng.
        “It looks tough on you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Thanks.” Jiang Cheng moved half of the meat into his own bowl, then
        pulled Gu Miao’s bowl over and moved the remaining into her bowl.
      </p>

      <p>“How did you hurt your hand?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not answer but that stemmed from truly not knowing what
        to say. Gu Fei must have known about Li Baoguo’s family. If he was to
        mention the situation, it would only give others another topic to
        converse – although, Gu Fei did not appear to be someone who gossiped
        about these kinds of things.
      </p>

      <p>He was silent for a moment: “Bit myself.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao looked at him, and after being stunned, she laughed out loud.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s a pretty good bite,” Gu Fei nodded his head. “Still, better to
        learn to cherish yourself. In the future, bite down lightly.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Miao and laughed with her before he drank all
        his soup.
      </p>

      <p>“Are you going back in a bit?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“I’m not,” Jiang Cheng answered very straightforwardly this time.</p>

      <p>
        “You have any place to go?” Gu Fei took two vegetables from a small
        basket to the side and put them in the pot.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yes,” Jiang Cheng said but was then somewhat hesitant. He went quiet
        for almost two minutes then once more spoke with difficulties. “Do you
        have money? Lend me some.”
      </p>

      <p>“How much?” Gu Fei put down his chopsticks.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng thought about it, “Just 500. I can transfer the money to you
        on my phone.”
      </p>

      <p>“Whatever,” Gu Fei pulled out his wallet and took out 500 RMB.</p>

      <p>
        “Thanks,” Jiang Cheng took the money, feeling quite at peace. He picked
        up his phone while saying, “Just friend me, I’ll transfer it over to
        you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Actually, once you get out of the intersection and turn right, there’s
        a fork in the road about 200 meters away. If you walk in there all the
        way to the end, there’s a Ru Jia<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> Hotel.” Gu Fei
        turned his phone on, “You will use less than 500.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at him but didn’t speak as he picked up his bowl and
        sipped the soup.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although Gu Fei didn’t guess wrong – and couldn’t guess wrong – under
        such circumstances, he had no choice aside from going to a hotel, but if
        he was to put it that way, it would make him lose face.
      </p>

      <p>His phone sounded and he looked down at the screen.</p>

      <p>It was Gu Fei’s friend request.</p>

      <p>小兔子乖乖. [Gentle little bunny]</p>

      <p>
        This nickname nearly made him spout the soup in his mouth onto the
        phone.
      </p>

      <p>“This is you?” he faced the phone in front of Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>“En, cute right?” Gu Fei said with a face of calmness.</p>

      <p>
        “…very cute,” Jiang Cheng was somewhat speechless. After accepting the
        request, he took another look at Gu Fei’s profile picture – quite
        suitable with the nickname: a green-colored rabbit. If he wasn’t
        mistaken, with the skill level and use of color, the artist should be Gu
        Miao. “This profile picture, did Gu Miao draw it?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao nodded her head from the side.</p>

      <p>
        “The drawing is… very nice,” Jiang Cheng praised very insincerely. Gu
        Miao’s drawing skills were comparatively 724 of Xiao Ming’s grandfather
        lesser than her skateboarding skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he was preparing to transfer the money to Gu Fei, the door to the
        shop sounded; someone pulled it up and lifted the curtain to the side
        just the slightest.
      </p>

      <p>
        He glanced over there and felt a bit strange. It was normal to buy
        things at this time – why the hell would you only lift the corner of the
        curtain as if you were sneaking a peek…
      </p>

      <p>
        Without waiting for him to understand, Gu Fei had already thrown his
        phone on the table and jumped up.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ai?” He stared blankly, holding up the cellphone in his hand as he
        watched Gu Fei dash out, <em>catching a thief?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Generally speaking, he didn’t like to meddle in other people’s business,
        in that way, it wouldn’t be a problem to live to 103 years old later on.
        But he was at Gu Fei’s place right now and Gu Fei had already dashed out
        – it was impossible for him to simply sit still.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stood up and prepared to go out. Just as he wanted to tell Gu Miao
        not to come out, he looked down only to see that Gu Miao was
        unexpectedly still eating as if nothing had happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll go take a look,” Jiang Cheng said before he also turned around and
        ran out.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as he was out of the shop, he saw Gu Fei clutching the collar of
        a man who was struggling with all his might.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the light illuminating from the dilapidated streetlamp being
        somewhat hazy, he could only see that the man was about 30 years old,
        wearing a faux leather jacket and skintight pants that wrapped around
        his slender legs, making them look like two toothpicks – looking at them
        would make one feel disgusted.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the hell are you doing?! Let go!” The man grabbed Gu Fei’s hand
        firmly, however, regardless of whether it was height or strength, he was
        clearly not Gu Fei’s opponent. After being tormented for a long while
        and with Gu Fei not moving, he could only shout again. “Let go!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did I or did I not tell you not to let me see you again?” Gu Fei kept
        his voice down.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who do you think you are? Why should I give a fuck if you’ve said it or
        not, so what if you did?” The man moved his face in front of Gu Fei’s
        with provocation. “I’m here now, you can see me, right?! What are you
        going to do about it? You…”
      </p>

      <p>
        The series of questions had yet to be completely arranged when Gu Fei
        firmly gripped his collar and swung him over toward the tree to the
        side.
      </p>

      <p>
        The man was like a hollow inflatable air dancer as his face went forward
        and his entire body smashed against the tree trunk.
      </p>

      <p><em>Bang.</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt as though his eyes had been magnified along with the
        sound – it was the first time he knew that the weight of a human body
        could make such a loud sound from colliding against wood.
      </p>

      <p>After this sound, the world became quiet.</p>

      <p>
        The man stood plastered to the street for two seconds before he slowly
        slid down the trunk, kneeled on the ground and then leaned crookedly to
        the side, collapsing there motionlessly.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck!” Jiang Cheng took two steps over there. <em>Is he dead?</em></p>

      <p>
        After staring for a while with no sign of movement from the man, Jiang
        Cheng turned his head to look at Gu Fei, who did not speak for a long
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although this person was thin and did not have a tall stature, he was a
        man after all, yet he was so easily flung toward the tree by Gu Fei
        using only one arm – if aslow-motion effect was in place, it would be at
        least two to three seconds…
      </p>

      <p>
        He suddenly felt a cold chill run down his spine, with Gu Fei’s skill,
        having <em>killed</em> a person or two would make sense.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go in,” Gu Fei glanced at him and walked toward the shop. “Aren’t you
        cold?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who’s he?” Jiang Cheng returned to his senses, “That you can throw over
        there without care? What happens if he freezes to death?”
      </p>

      <p>“If he’s dead, I’ll kill you off to silence you.” Gu Fei laughed.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng realized that he himself was quite the rotten person –
        skipping class and picking fights were things he did not lack doing, but
        he had never knocked someone out cold and left them lying in the snow
        just for him to go back inside and continue eating.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey,” he followed Gu Fei into the shop and stared intently as Gu Fei
        plopped back down on the chair nonchalantly. This conversation could not
        be bluntly carried out with Gu Miao present, so Jiang Cheng could only
        vaguely hint at it, “That… you’re really not going to take care of it?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t worry, it’s fine,” Gu Fei looked at him. “He’ll leave by himself
        once he stands up and he’ll only need to fix his nose bridge at most…
        you’re quite kind. How come you weren’t worried when you come into
        contact with Hou Zi and his gang.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did I…” Jiang Cheng pointed toward the door and then after having to
        decide on a proper vocabulary for quite a while, he added: “… put them
        to sleep?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at him in silence, but the suppressed smile on his face
        could be easily seen.
      </p>

      <p>“Fine,” Jiang Cheng sat down. “It’s not like I caused it.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei lowered his head and continued to eat. Jiang Cheng didn’t say
        anything else afterward even though he really wasn’t sure if the guy
        outside could “stand up” and even “walk away himself”.
      </p>

      <p>
        The difference in the environment was a plausible factor – the
        environment he grew up in taught him that no matter how worrisome his
        actions were, there was always a “degree” to which these actions were
        exercised. Yet Gu Fei, looking at this rundown old town, looking at the
        people around, this sort of unrestrained wildness was able to go
        unnoticed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thinking in this way, Jiang Cheng actually felt quite thankful toward Gu
        Fei, thankful that when he lied face flat in the snow “sleeping” back
        then, Gu Fei didn’t let him freeze to death outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was quite accustomed to eating in silence with the Gu
        siblings, the two previous meals were all like this. Gu Miao didn’t
        talk, Jiang Cheng had nothing to say and Gu Fei had no desire to speak
        at all from the looks of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eating like this was quite time-efficient, ten minutes in and they were
        just about finished.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he put down his chopsticks and was going to say a word of gratitude,
        a string of painful curses sounded from outside the door. From the sound
        of it, the guy who was put to sleep had finally woken up.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng let out a sigh of relief and continued to listen.</p>

      <p>
        The person cursed but with great difficulty, most likely because his
        nose bridge was broken. Loosely listening to the words, his scripted
        cursing was stylistically very similar to the fight in which Li Baoguo’s
        neighbors were involved.
      </p>

      <p>This was perhaps street culture.</p>

      <p>
        Except there was a sonorous phrase that caught his attention, so unable
        to refrain himself Jiang Cheng glanced up at Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        “So I fucked your mom, what are you gonna do about it!” The person’s
        speech was unclear, but it could still be deciphered.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Gu Fei’s gaze met his own, he took a few more sips of the soup
        before responding: “My mom’s boyfriend…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What?” Jiang Cheng did not wait for him to finish before expressing his
        own extreme surprise. Though the man was quite disgusting, he was at
        most around thirty, even if Gu Fei’s mother gave birth to him at the age
        of twenty, she would still have to be close to forty.
      </p>

      <p>“Among many,” Gu Fei finished his sentence.</p>

      <p>“Ah?” Jiang Cheng froze.</p>

      <p>
        “You full yet?” Gu Fei asked. “There’s still some more meat, add more if
        you’re not full.”
      </p>

      <p>“I’m full, I’m full,” Jiang Cheng nodded hastily.</p>

      <p>“Er Miao, clean this up,” Gu Fei said, putting down his chopsticks.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao instantly stood up and very proficiently stacked the bowls
        together before she gathered the chopsticks into one hand and carried
        them all out the backdoor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at this manner, Jiang Cheng suddenly felt a bit displeased as he
        thought back to Li Baoguo saying, “this sort of thing needs to be done
        by women”. Jiang Cheng reached out his hands wanting to help clean up.
      </p>

      <p>“You sit still,” Gu Fei stopped him. “She can do it.”</p>

      <p>
        “Because these sorts of things should be done by women, right?” Jiang
        Cheng turned to glare at him.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei froze and then smiled: “Did I say that?”</p>

      <p>
        “Silent omission, right?” Jiang Cheng thought back to tonight’s chaotic
        play put up by Li Baoguo’s family and the anger he extinguished with
        great difficulty began to climb back up with a rapid pace.
      </p>

      <p>“I,” Gu Fei pointed at himself, “Cook.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Gu Er Miao,” Gu Fei pointed toward Gu Miao’s fleeting figure walking in
        and out of the back door, “Wash the dishes”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng continued to look at him.</p>

      <p>“Is there something wrong with that?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Ah.” Jiang Cheng looked at him, the flames of anger that were slowly
        crawling upward instantly all turned into awkwardness.
      </p>

      <p>“Ah?” Gu Fei also looked at him.</p>

      <p>“… ah.” Jiang Cheng really was unsure of what to say next.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei ignored him. He stood up and left the table, sat down behind the
        cashier counter and lit up a cigarette, allowing it to dangle in his
        mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wanted to leave, but his upbringing didn’t allow him to drop
        his chopsticks and leave after having a meal at someone else’s house. He
        could only sit beside the table and watch as Gu Miao ran back and forth
        two, three times until the table was clean.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he was about to ask Gu Fei for a cigarette, Gu Fei stood up with
        the cigarette dangling in his mouth and followed Gu Miao out the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        All that was left inside the shop was him staring at an empty table
        surface, spacing out.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck.</em></p>

      <p>He took out his phone and sent Pan Zhi a message.</p>

      <p>– Grandson.</p>

      <p>– Grandpa! Wanna chat for a while?</p>

      <p>– I’m busy.</p>

      <p>
        Pan Zhi sent over a voice message: “You fucking bored to death and sent
        this to play me! I got reprimanded by my mom just now and she wouldn’t
        even give me a meal!”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng heard this, he immediately laughed and returned him a
        voice message – a full 20 seconds laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        After having finished laughing, Jiang Cheng stood up and decided to take
        a look at what the Gu siblings were doing in the back. If nothing was
        going on, he should be leaving.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he exited from the back door, there was a small courtyard, most
        likely shared by a couple of storefronts at once, there was also a
        bathroom and a small kitchen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was knocked straight in the face by a gust of wind the
        instant he walked out the door, he immediately rushed towards the
        kitchen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stood with his back facing the door, Gu Miao stood beside the
        kitchen sink and was washing the dishes with hot water.
      </p>

      <p>
        The little girl was quite proficient, and her expression was also very
        concentrated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng watched for a moment, unable to understand the point of Gu
        Fei standing here. Gu Miao was not a small child, if her job was to do
        the dishes, then let her be, why must he stand there and watch?
      </p>

      <p>“That…” he cleared his throat.</p>

      <p>
        He was unsure if Gu Miao was too concentrated in washing since she acted
        as if she did not hear him and continued to wash the dishes with care.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei turned his head: “En?”</p>

      <p>
        “I’m getting ready to go,” Jiang Cheng said. “Do you have jackets you
        don’t wear often? Lend me one.”
      </p>

      <p>“None,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        “What the fuck?” Jiang Cheng stared at him. “What are you getting at?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There are ones I wear often,” Gu Fei answered. “They’re in the closet
        inside the room, you can go take one out yourself.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh, thanks.” Jiang Cheng turned around, getting ready to get a
        jacket.
      </p>

      <p>“Cheng-<em>ge</em>,” Gu Fei’s call halted him to a stop.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stopped. Gu Fei following Gu Miao in calling him Cheng-<em
          >ge</em
        >
        made him feel a bit weird, but also inexplicably <em>comfortable </em>–
        he almost wanted to answer back with “what’s up little bro.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Leave after she’s finished washing, and tell her goodbye,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng nodded his head, “You… give me a cigarette.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took out a lighter and a cigarette box from his pocket and handed
        them to him, then turned back around to keep watching Gu Miao wash the
        dishes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took the cigarette and backed out to the edge of the door to
        light it, then also turned to watch Gu Miao wash.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although he was unsure, and it was still inconvenient to ask – he could
        feel that Gu Miao was possibly a bit different from the average child,
        hence Gu Fei had to watch over her even while she was washing the
        dishes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Except, if he was this anxious, why allow her to fly around the streets
        on a skateboard by herself. And even when she was bullied, he did not
        seem to do much about it.
      </p>

      <p><em>How interesting.</em></p>

      <p><em>All the people here are very interesting.</em></p>

      <p>
        Sometimes all these felt very unreal to him, these alleyways, these
        scenes, these people he had been seeing, these problems, they all seem
        somewhat illusionistic. Only when he was in contact with Pan Zhi did he
        feel as though he had returned to a realistic world.
      </p>

      <p>He had probably time traveled, right?</p>

      <p>Another era? Another dimension?</p>

      <p>In a different world?</p>

      <p>Thinking like this caused him to shiver in astonishment.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei just happened to have turned around to look at him: “Isn’t it
        better if you stayed inside?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng ignored him.</p>

      <p>
        After having finished washing the dishes and putting them away, Gu Miao
        finally turned and exited the kitchen. As she passed Jiang Cheng, it was
        as if she didn’t see him. Jiang Cheng followed her back into the shop,
        and it was only when she started to look for him did she turned around
        to see Jiang Cheng behind her.
      </p>

      <p>‘You’re quite capable.” Jiang Cheng stuck up his thumb at her.</p>

      <p>Gu Miao rubbed her nose, seeming quite abashed.</p>

      <p>“So,” Jiang Cheng bent down to talk to her, “I’ll be leaving now.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao glanced at Gu Fei and then nodded her head toward Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>“I’ll see you later?” Jiang Cheng raised a hand and waved at her.</p>

      <p>Gu Miao also waved back at him.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng smiled, originally thinking he could hear her say a
        “goodbye”, but it was still a pantomime.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei walked inside and took out a long down-jacket for him.</p>

      <p>“Thank you” Jiang Cheng took the jacket from him while eyeing it.</p>

      <p>“Hat, gloves, scarf, mask?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “… no need,” Jiang Cheng replied since there was a total of only a
        couple hundred metres in distance. “A charger… do you have any extras?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei walked back inside and took out a charger for him.</p>

      <p>
        “Thank you,” Jiang Cheng took it and put it inside the jacket pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        “… if someone was to throw a fist at you, would you also say a word of
        thanks out of habit?” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why don’t you give it a try?” Jiang Cheng pulled on the jacket, lifted
        up the curtains and walked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stretched his back, then picked up his phone to look at the time.
        He lightly patted Gu Miao on the head: “Come on, let’s go home.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao quickly closed all the doors and windows of the shop and then
        headed outside to wait for him with the skateboard hugged to her chest.
      </p>

      <p>
        He organized the money in the cash register and turned off the lights.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We’ll walk back today, Xin-<em>jie</em> borrowed our car,” Gu Fei said
        as he looked up the shop doors. “You have to go into your room and do
        your homework once we get home, and you can only come out once you’re
        finished.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao nodded her head and dropped the skateboard onto the ground. With
        a simple push of her feet, she dashed out ten-some metres before being
        tripped over by an unknown objected and falling over from her board.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei laughed while blowing a whistle at her.</p>

      <p>
        Yet Gu Miao ignored him and dashed out again with her feet on the
        skateboard after climbing up from the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they arrived home it was a bit past eight o’clock, the living room
        light and TV were both on. The door to their mother’s room was tightly
        shut, yet the faint glow of light could be seen through the cracks of
        the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once Gu Miao walked into her own room to do homework, Gu Fei walked over
        to stand outside his mother’s door and knocked.
      </p>

      <p>There was no response from within.</p>

      <p>“I’m going to enter after one minute,” Gu Fei let out.</p>

      <p>
        After having entered the kitchen to boil a pot of water and steeped a
        cup of tea for himself, he once again walked over to stand outside the
        door to his mother’s room. This time, he turned the doorknob after
        knocking twice.
      </p>

      <p>
        The door was not locked – neither could it be locked. It was left
        unfixed from the last time he broke down the door while his mom made a
        farce on committing suicide.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Get out,” Mom was sitting on a small sofa positioned under the
        windowsill with a phone in her hand, eyes flaming with anger as she
        glared at him. “Get out! Who allowed you to come in!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You having a call with that guy?” Gu Fei started to raise his voice.
        “You tell him, if he doesn’t hang up now, I’ll go find him tomorrow –
        along with that part-time store he works at – I won’t leave even a
        single crumb behind once I’m done.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You…” Mom rolled her eyes at him and pushed the phone under her ear.
        “Tell you what… hello? Hello? Hello! Bastard, son of a bitch!”
      </p>

      <p>
        His mom brutally threw her cell phone onto the sofa: “No, like, what is
        your problem?! Your mom wants to fall in love and be in a relationship
        with someone yet why are you here being incessantly like this. Don’t you
        think you’re minding too much of my business! It’s not like there’s much
        worth to inherit from our family, are you afraid there’s going to be
        someone fighting over the inheritance from you two?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “From your group of young men, pick one, a reliable one, “Gu Fei took a
        sip of tea. “See if I care.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Which one <em>isn’t </em>reliable ah!” Mom’s eyebrows scrunched,
        “You’re annoying me to death.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Which one is reliable?” Gu Fei looked at her. “Stop giving them money
        and try – see which one will still respond.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why wouldn’t they respond!” Mom slapped at the sofa. “Am I that ugly
        looking? If I’m ugly, then how could you have grown up with so many
        people praising you on being handsome!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei picked up the small mirror that was silently lying on the
        bedside table and examined himself, “Handsome.”
      </p>

      <p>“You…” Mom opened her mouth but was interrupted by him.</p>

      <p>
        “Everyone was telling me how beautiful my mother was when she was
        young,” Gu Fei put down the mirror. “Do you know what it means by ‘when
        she was young’? There are so many more young girls out there now who are
        prettier than you, younger than you, and stupider than you. If they’re
        not here for a bit of your money, who at the age of twenty or thirty
        would be in a relationship with a forty-year-old like you…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Get out, get out, get out!” Mom jumped up from the sofa and pushed him
        out the door. “I have nothing more to say to you, get out!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei backhandedly grabbed her wrist: “Don’t take the money from the
        cash register anymore, there’s only so much. I don’t even have to count
        to know you took them.”
      </p>

      <p>
        His mom didn’t respond, instead, she went back to her room and slammed
        the door shut.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei collapsed onto the living room sofa and continued to sip his tea.
        He grabbed the remote control and flipped through the channels – this
        was a time left for the dramas with mothers, mother-in-laws and
        daughter-in-laws, aunts and uncles to squabble and bicker, otherwise, it
        would be dramas with a Virgin Mary who was forgiving of the past and
        used love to melt the heart of a lying son of a bitch.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he browsed through the channels, he closed the TV and walked into
        his own room.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then he opened the computer, and without a single strand of hesitation
        of choosing photography over homework, Gu Fei began to process his
        photos.
      </p>

      <p>
        Homework – he didn’t know how to write them no matter if he did it or
        not. Just like how he always failed his tests no matter if he answered
        them or not.
      </p>

      <p>
        He transferred the photos from his camera to the computer, first he
        deleted the scrap shots and then picked out the ones that were worth
        processing from the remaining.
      </p>

      <p>
        Er Miao’s shots were all pretty good. The little girl had wiped away all
        smiles from her face whenever she was being photographed, leaving only a
        serious expression as if she was about to go and bomb the school – yet
        it was quite cool looking.
      </p>

      <p>
        The streetscape wasn’t very good, too messy, and the background was too
        mismatched. The sunset ones were okay, the one with a person wearing a
        long red overcoat passing on the bridge was especially good looking in
        terms of color… Jiang Cheng, Jiang Cheng, the ones with Jiang Cheng…
      </p>

      <p>
        He knitted his eyebrows together and compared them, deciding to keep the
        first one before deleting all the others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plugging in his earphones, he started to process the photos while music
        was playing in the background.
      </p>

      <p>
        Processing photographs was quite tedious work, but it was also quite
        interesting to perform once he started – much more interesting than
        attending class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recently, this music player became quite extreme under his meticulous
        guidance. The songs in his personal radio station outdid the next in
        terms of bombarding his head, causing his mouse-clicking movements to
        look as if he was galvanized, and his actions were completed in muddled
        chaos.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once he changed the playlist to the one in his hard drive, it became
        much more calming.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he shuffled through two songs, the familiar sounds of a guitar
        started to play, soon followed by the piano and then the voice of a
        woman.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >I step up into the void, I’m about to fly… above me is confusion,
          below me I hear you say this world is empty…</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei moved the mouse and clicked on the next song.</p>

      <p>
        <em>Has it been a few years already,</em> it didn’t feel weird when he
        first wrote it, but now it sounded quite immature. The female voice was
        Ding Zhuxin, who had handled it quite nicely – within the lazy and
        raucous voice contained doubt and struggle.
      </p>

      <p>
        After finishing Jiang Cheng’s photos, he glanced at the time – almost
        eleven o’clock. Time was always like this. When you needed it, there was
        none and when you didn’t need it, nothing could make it pass.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stretched his back and looked at the screen display full of Jiang
        Cheng’s face. The light was just right, the ambiance and style were just
        right, a teen wearing the expression of disdain was also just right, not
        making eye contact with the camera was also good.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was much better than those paid models Ding Zhuxin hired for her
        trash of an online store that Gu Fei used for practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        He downsized the photos by a slight fraction, checked to see if the
        photos as a whole had any problems before saving them and then opened
        Meitu Xiu Xiu.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
      </p>

      <p>Color change, light dimming, adding filter, fantasy, starlight…</p>

      <p>
        And finally, he even added a row of text on top of the photo——sorrowful
        music, unbridled rotation, the night seemed all the more silent.
      </p>

      <p>After arranging the frame, he sent it to Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        Last of the Wilds<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>, Jiang Cheng’s ID seemed to
        imply that he was indeed a <em>xueba</em>. Even though the English
        letters appeared no different than Chinese Pinyin in front of Gu Fei, he
        had actually heard of this piece, and quite liked it in fact – heavy
        metal style piper.
      </p>

      <p>
        And then taking a look at Jiang Cheng’s profile picture, it was a view
        of his back and his profile, very blurry, but he could tell it was Jiang
        Cheng by looking at the nose… this photo was taken quite nicely.
      </p>

      <p>A few minutes later, Jiang Cheng replied to his message.</p>

      <p>– Do you have a problem…</p>

      <p>He started to smile.</p>

      <p>– What’s wrong?</p>

      <p>
        – You must actually be an emoji artist right! Why didn’t you make me a
        middle-aged, elderly man emoji? Tonight, we raise our cups and toast to
        our friendship and what not.
      </p>

      <p>– Do you want it? I’ll help you make one.</p>

      <p>– Fuck off.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei leaned against the chair and laughed for some time before
        replying.
      </p>

      <p>– Why, you don’t like it?</p>

      <p>– What happened to humanity?</p>

      <p>Gu Fei sent him the original version while laughing.</p>

      <p>
        On the other side, Jiang Cheng became silent and after a couple minutes,
        he finally replied.
      </p>

      <p>– Just one? Is there any more?　</p>

      <p>– None, the other ones weren’t as good, I deleted them.</p>

      <p>
        – … well aren’t you strict with yourself, couldn’t you have sent them to
        me first and have me delete them myself?
      </p>

      <p>– Didn’t you say you wanted to delete them this afternoon?</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng didn’t reply.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei put down his cell phone and exercised his slightly stiff limbs
        before walking out of his room.
      </p>

      <p>
        The light in Gu Miao’s room was already turned off. He walked over and
        pushed open the door to peek inside. The little girl had already
        finished her homework and also washed up, now she was wrapped up in her
        blanket sleeping soundly.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he was busy doing his own thing he didn’t like to be disturbed, not
        only did Gu Miao remember this fact, even his unreliable mom knew this…
        he was unsure of when his mom left the house, but she left without a
        single sound – not disturbing him at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei knitted his eyebrows, took off his jacket that was hanging on the
        hook beside the door and fished out his wallet only to see that the
        hundred dollar bills inside were all gone.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck,” he swore under his breath.</p>

      <p>He returned to his room and dialed Liu Fan’s number.</p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei? You coming out? We’re having a drink right now,” Liu Fan’s
        joyful voice sounded from the other end. “Li Yan and us, we’re all
        here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m not going, I’m tired, going to bed,” Gu Fei said. “Go somewhere
        with me tomorrow.”
      </p>

      <p>“Going where?” Liu Fan asked immediately.</p>

      <p>“The CD store I mentioned from last time,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        “That shop with the boss and employees who all fake out that they’re
        some musical geniuses?” Liu Fan asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The boss is the real shit,” Gu Fei replied. “I’m looking for the
        thin-legged grasshopper.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I got it, you don’t need to come,” Liu Fan clicked his tongue. “It
        isn’t right if you went. I’ll bring the others with me, what kind of
        result do you want?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The result of turning and running the other way whenever he sees my
        mom,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>“Alright,” Liu Fan answered.</p>

      <p>
        Once he hung up the call, his phone sounded again – Jiang Cheng sent
        over a message.
      </p>

      <p>– Thank you.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei glanced at his profile picture and realized he had already
        changed it to the one he just sent him.
      </p>

      <p>– Changed your profile picture already?</p>

      <p>– En, it’s pretty cool.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei smiled. He put down his phone and got ready to wash up. When he
        got to the doorway, his phone sounded again.
      </p>

      <p>He walked back, picked it up and took a look.</p>

      <p>
        – I might have to wear your jacket for another day tomorrow since I’ll
        only have time to go buy one after school.
      </p>

      <p>– Aren’t you going to wash it before returning it to me?</p>

      <p>– … do you have mysophobia?</p>

      <p>
        – No, between the quilt cover and the jacket – how about you choose one
        to wash.
      </p>

      <p>– I’ll wash the jacket and return it to you.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei yawned, not sure if it was because he ate too much meat that
        night, but he was extremely drowsy.
      </p>

      <p>
        After washing up, Gu Fei fell onto the bed and instantly fell asleep,
        and only when he felt cold throughout the night did he pulled on the
        blanket.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he woke up in the morning, everyone was gone. His mom didn’t come
        back for the whole night and Gu Miao had already left for school by
        herself. He glanced at the time, not to mention morning reading, the
        first class had already passed by half.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ay——” He dragged out his voice and stretch his back with all his might
        before he lazily organized his things and went out the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he arrived downstairs, Lao Xu’s call came in: “If you continue
        to be like this for this semester, are you waiting to be expelled?!”
      </p>

      <p>“I overslept,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t care what excuse you have today,” Lao Xu replied. “I need to
        have a talk with you at noon! I need to take responsibility for you!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… what did you do to me that you need to take responsibility?” Gu Fei
        asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You stop mouthing off!” Lao Xu replied. “I didn’t know about your
        problems before, that’s my dereliction of duty! Now that I know, it is
        my duty to take care of you!”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei’s steps faltered: “What of my problems?”</p>

      <p>
        “The problem with your father,” Lao Xu very earnestly replied. “As your
        homeroom teacher, I sincerely hope you can open up your heart to me…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You don’t have to worry about my problem,” Gu Fei answered. “Why do I
        care who you are? Do you believe that I can open up and kick your ass?”
      </p>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng woke up a bit late in the morning. When he opened his eyes,
        it was almost time for the first period to begin.
      </p>

      <p>
        His record time for skipping class was two days, and for not returning
        home three days, yet he was barely late for class. He himself was not
        sure why, but if he decided to attend class, then he would much rather
        not be late.
      </p>

      <p>
        School had only just begun, he did not plan on skipping at the moment.
        He looked at the time and jumped out of bed, ran into the bathroom and
        grabbed a single-use toothbrush.
      </p>

      <p>
        He normally wouldn’t use these things even when he stayed in hotels
        because these toothbrushes had deadly stiff bristles and its size was
        unnecessarily super large, plus they usually didn’t have any favorable
        flavours… and when he was gurgling, he wasn’t sure if it was because he
        had put too much power into his left hand or the toothbrush was just too
        crappy, but he had noticed that his gums would bleed.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he lifted his head, he saw his own pale, sleep-deprived self in the
        mirror – there were even hints of black circles around his eyes, paired
        with the white foam around his mouth…
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah…” Facing the mirror, he used the hand wrapped in bandage to clasp
        his chest and pointed ahead dramatically as he painfully took a few
        breaths of air into his lungs. “Shit… there’s poison… in this shit! Ah!”
      </p>

      <p>
        He laughed to himself for a while after his performance ended, then
        remembering that he was almost late, he quickly started to splash water
        on his face for a quick wash.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he ran out of the motel after checking out, he could almost feel
        the Ru Jia from across the street laughing at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        That’s right, he followed Gu Fei’s clear instructions yesterday and
        found the Ru Jia. However, as he searched his whole body, he found that
        besides the five hundred yuan and the cell phone, not a single article
        of clothing belonged to himself. He simply couldn’t stay at the Ru Jia
        in the end.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because he didn’t have his ID on him, the receptionist threatened to
        call the police while he tried to have her help think of a way to get in
        – it could not have gotten any worse.
      </p>

      <p>
        A large old area in a small rotten city, why was it so difficult to get
        a room in a motel?!
      </p>

      <p>
        He already had on Gu Fei’s wool sweater, wearing Gu Fei’s down-jacket,
        took Gu Fei’s charger, also ate his meal and smoked his cigarette, he
        really had no face to go back and ask Gu Fei to let him borrow his ID.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he succumbed to his fate and decided to hole up in an internet
        cafe for the night, he spotted a small motel from across the street, and
        hence was finally saved.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned back to give the small motel a final look, “Zhou’s Family
        Motel”, and mentally took note. The next time he wrote his memory logs
        he could come back and relish.
      </p>

      <p>
        After buying breakfast from a small shop below the motel, he didn’t have
        the time to eat it before he stuffed it in his bag and furiously ran
        toward the direction of the school.
      </p>

      <p>
        The distance between Si Zhong and this side of the town weren’t too far
        – two stops away, and they were small stops too. If one was to use the
        time to wait for the bus and then squeeze on, you could have walked to
        your destination already. But to say that it was close, it still just
        about killed him running the full way and also, it was difficult to spot
        a taxi so early in the morning.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he ran toward the school gate, Jiang Cheng heard the warning bell
        rang. The people around him approached the gate as if they were filtered
        in a slow-motion shot, without a single sign of reaction, they continued
        to eat and chat away while slowly moving forward. In accordance with the
        rhythm of the warning bell, they stepped onto the school campus looking
        like they were strolling into their own backyard.
      </p>

      <p>
        He slowed his own steps, not wanting to seem like a fast-paced nerd in
        front of this large audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Considering his current conditions, if he was in his previous school,
        the teachers on duty would have already started a swearing campaign. Yet
        the teacher standing at the gate of Si Zhong – whether they were
        good-tempered or already accustomed to such nonsense – was gently
        screaming: “Hurry! Speed up your pace! Whoever climbs the gate after it
        closes will receive penalty marks!”
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Climb the gate?</em> Jiang Cheng turned around to look at the school
        gate.
      </p>

      <p>
        The gate to Si Zhong was actually quite imposing: double layered, one
        layer was a half-person tall mechanized door, and on the inside was a
        two-framed metal door with spikes on the tip.
      </p>

      <p>
        He suddenly remembered that Gu Fei was late yesterday –
        <em>he climbed inside?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Tsk.</em> Just thinking about that row of pointy spikes, he could
        feel a swish of cold wind blowing past his crotch.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he climbed up the stairs someone called his name from behind: “Jiang
        Cheng!”
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned around to see Wang Xu holding an extra-large-sized pancake,
        gnawing and running toward him at the same time.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Geez, it’s really you.” Wang Xu looked at him from top to bottom, “I
        thought it was Da Fei just now, but then realized the hat isn’t
        right…why are you wearing his clothes? These are his clothes, right?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng continued up the stairs.</p>

      <p>
        “Did something happen?” Wang Xu looked at his hand. “The fuck, what
        happened to your hand? Was it Hou Zi? You went to hide at Da Fei’s?”
      </p>

      <p>“No, it wasn’t. No,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>
        “You don’t have to hide it from me.” Wang Xu gave his shoulder a pat in
        a very loyal manner, “This happened because of me. If anything else
        occurs, I’ll take responsibility, just tell me the truth…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t,” Jiang Cheng turned around to look at him. “Pat my shoulder.”
      </p>

      <p>Wang Xu lifted his hand.</p>

      <p>“Also, don’t pat my back,” Jiang Cheng added.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Wang Xu quite uncomfortably contracted his hand back into his
        pocket, taking a few large strides as he passed Jiang Cheng and walked
        upstairs. “So many problems.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t show up to the morning self-study period, no one knew if
        he was late or just skipped altogether.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng slouched over his desk, and using Zhou Jing’s body to hide
        himself, he slowly ate his breakfast. Four weeks hadn’t passed yet these
        five people were already eating together.
      </p>

      <p>
        He thought to himself as he ate, it had only been two days and he had
        already assimilated?
      </p>

      <p>
        His breakfast was actually very simple: fried dumplings and soymilk. He
        had even very carefully asked for cabbage fillings in his dumplings,
        being afraid that the smell would be too strong when he ate in class.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet taking a look around him, Chinese chives filled dumplings, chives
        filled meat pies… forget the smell, there was even someone slurping on a
        bowl of beef flavoured instant noodles.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first period was English, and Lao Lu walked in screaming as usual
        and unsurprisingly, he had even stolen half a dumpling from a kid who
        ate so slow that he was still eating after a period of self-study and
        break.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ay</em>.” Zhou Jing shifted his head, “Jiang Cheng, Jiang Cheng.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng glanced at him, not uttering a sound.</p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng?” Zhou Jing called him again, “Jiang Cheng.”</p>

      <p>
        “Just say it,” Jiang Cheng finally knew why Gu Fei never bothered to
        acknowledge him, this person talked incessantly until you answered to
        your name.
      </p>

      <p>“You’re wearing Da Fei’s clothes today, right?” Zhou Jing asked.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng scrunched his eyebrows and looked at the down-jacket draped
        over his chair. He was starting to feel that he wore a jacket that Gu
        Fei wore very often.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu recognized it with a single glance, even Zhou Jing recognized it
        – half of the class had probably realized that he was wearing Gu Fei’s
        jacket to class.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he lowered his head to look at the sweater on his body, he could only
        pray that this wasn’t a regular as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The sweater is Da Fei’s as well, right?” Zhou Jing asked again. “You
        were at Da Fei’s house yesterday?”
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck!</em></p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng ignored him and stretched over the desk wanting to nap.</p>

      <p>
        “Ay, Jiang Cheng.” Zhou Jing did stop his habit of hitting against the
        desk, “Why didn’t Da Fei come to class today?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll smack you if you don’t shut the hell up,” Jiang Cheng muttered
        with his eyes closed.
      </p>

      <p>Zhou Jing sighed and no sound came from his direction afterward. 　</p>

      <p>
        The classroom was very cozy, roasting warm honestly, yet to take off the
        sweater just didn’t seem right either, not to mention that he wasn’t
        wearing anything under the sweater, and he couldn’t sit in class
        half-naked.
      </p>

      <p>
        This Gu Fei seemed low-key, not saying more than two sentences at school
        nor did he seem to be especially close to anyone. He even went to the
        washroom alone, and yet, every single one of these people remembered
        what he wore.
      </p>

      <p><em>How fucking amazing.</em></p>

      <p>
        The second period was language class. After class ended, Lao Xu walked
        over and eyed him: “Jiang Cheng, come over for a sec.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stood up, hesitatingly pulling on Gu Fei’s jacket as he
        followed Lao Xu out of the classroom to stand out in the hallway
        together: “What’s the matter, Xu Zong?”
      </p>

      <p>“Why didn’t Gu Fei come to class today?” Lao Xu asked.</p>

      <p>“How would I know?” Jiang Cheng was somewhat speechless.</p>

      <p>
        “You don’t know?” Lao Xu looked at him, his face written with four
        gigantic characters, ‘I don’t believe you’, followed by ‘do you really
        not know or are you just unwilling to tell me?’
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t even know him that well, why would I cover for him?” Jiang
        Cheng answered in annoyance.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh, so it’s like that,” Lao Xu sighed. “I saw you wearing his clothes,
        so I assumed you guys were together yesterday and knew why he wasn’t
        here today.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh,” Jiang Cheng uttered, and he could only utter such. One more word
        and it felt like he would have a mouthful of old blood spurt out.　
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng ah,” Lao Xu looked at him. “These two days that you have
        been in contact with Gu Fei, how do you feel about him as a person?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at Lao Xu. If he didn’t know for a fact that he was
        in school right now, that the person standing in front of him was his
        homeroom teacher and that Gu Fei was only his desk partner, he would
        have thought he was facing a blind date introducer.
      </p>

      <p>
        “One day,” Jiang Cheng corrected Lao Xu’s speech. “Half a day to be
        precise.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yes, he wasn’t here yesterday afternoon,” Lao Xu knitted his eyebrows.
        “Then, how do you feel…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I have no feels,” Jiang Cheng interrupted him. “Xu Zong, I have no
        opinion towards this person.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei is quite smart. He’s different from the rest of those
        underachievers,” Lao Xu was adamant about expressing his own opinions.
        “If his ideologies could be worked out, his grades would improve.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “By me?” Jiang Cheng pointed at himself, he almost wanted to ask, ‘you
        sure you’re awake?’
      </p>

      <p>
        “No, no, me,” Lao Xu smiled, pointing a finger at himself. “Ideologies
        should, of course, be worked out by the homeroom teacher.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng remained silent. He could see that Lao Xu was a good person,
        but just based on his current position in the heart of his students, the
        difficulty of this job was quite big. Even a person like Zhou Jing
        wouldn’t buy his words, let alone Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I was thinking, your grades are very good,” Lao Xu stated. “Could you
        be his learning partner?”
      </p>

      <p>“What?” Jiang Cheng stared at Lao Xu in surprise.</p>

      <p><em>Learning – partner?</em></p>

      <p>
        This sort of pairing only took place during middle school, the end
        result was either that it resolved to nothing or early love
        relationships. To appear again in high school, Lao Xu’s current
        expression really resembled that of a middle-aged sticker.<a
          href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        “Not really learning-partners,” Lao Xu tried to explain. “Just, help him
        out more often, have him listen to lectures more during class, teach him
        the questions he doesn’t understand…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at him, unable to understand what power resided
        within Lao Xu that could make him believe the illusion of Gu Fei being
        able to accept the supervision of someone else.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Before, I had Yi Jing tutor him during her free time. Yi Jing is the
        class president, she’s very diligent, but she is a girl after all, it
        gets inconvenient,” Lao Xu blabbered on. “So now I hope that you… under
        the conditions that it does not influence your own grades, take care of
        a classmate.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu’s expression was very earnest. His tone tinted with a style of
        intervention made Jiang Cheng unsure of how to answer back.
      </p>

      <p>
        From a small age till now, he had always eaten soft rather than hard and
        ate earnestly rather than guises, however, with Lao Xu’s overtly naive
        request, he really could not digest.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Xu Zong,” he replied with equal sincerity. “I think you should get to
        know me better before concluding that this job should be handed to me,
        grades aren’t exactly industry standards to measuring a person’s
        character. Don’t you see that I didn’t even bring my textbooks to class
        today?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The conversation did not continue once the bell for class started to
        ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei did not come to school for the whole morning, and no teacher
        bothered to ask during class, almost as if it didn’t matter to them who
        came to class and who didn’t.
      </p>

      <p>
        When class ended, Jiang Cheng was the first to leave the classroom. He
        had no items to collect, all he had to do was put on his jacket and
        leave. He left faster than those running to the cafeteria to grab food
        as he dashed out of the school like a streak of lightning.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today’s luck was okay. Jiang Cheng spotted a taxi right as he exited the
        school gate, and without even waiting for the previous customer to get
        out he climbed in the shotgun position.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Besides the shopping centre downtown,” Jiang Cheng asked the driver.
        “Where else can I purchase clothes?”
      </p>

      <p>The driver answered after some thought: “The shopping centre.”</p>

      <p>“Where?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“Downtown,” the driver answered.</p>

      <p>
        “… oh,” Jiang Cheng leaned back and closed his eyes. “Then just go
        there.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The shopping centre was quite unsightly. That day when Jiang Cheng and
        Pan Zhi ate roasted meat around there, they had walked around the shops
        but didn’t find anything eye-catching. But now wasn’t the time for that,
        it was fine as long as it was clothing.
      </p>

      <p>
        He randomly picked and entered a store that was said to be having a sale
        so large the owner was about to cut their own throat and commit suicide.
        He grabbed a wool sweater and a down-jacket and tried them on. Then,
        feeling okay, he purchased them with the cash and asked the staff to cut
        off the tag.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he left with Gu Fei’s jacket in hand, he felt as though he could
        finally relax.
      </p>

      <p>
        The style of his new clothes was so-so, but at least they were warm, and
        the quality was pretty good, the cost was okay too – the price
        definitely wasn’t at the neck-slicing stage, it was enough to jump out
        from the first-floor window at most.
      </p>

      <p>
        After finding a spot to eat near the shopping centre, he didn’t know
        where else to go.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>How ‘bout going back to school</em>, and he could also find a
        dry-cleaning shop nearby to wash Gu Fei’s clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wasn’t going to call a taxi anymore. The card that his mother gave
        him had quite the amount of money, but looking at the situation with Li
        Baoguo’s family, he probably had to make this money last from high
        school till university… he looked around and spotted a bus stop ahead.
      </p>

      <p>Just as he was walking, his phone rang.</p>

      <p>It was from Li Baoguo.</p>

      <p>He answered the phone unwillingly: “Hello?”</p>

      <p>
        “Cheng Cheng ah!” Li Baoguo’s loud voice rang across from the other end.
        “Your class must have ended!”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng continued toward the bus stop.</p>

      <p>
        “Where did you spend the night last night?” Li Baoguo asked. “Such large
        temperaments, if the neighbors didn’t know better, they would’ve thought
        I did something to you!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t speak. He stood under the bus stop to see if there
        were any buses that stopped near the school.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did your anger simmer?” Li Baoguo continued to ask. “Come home and eat,
        I made dumplings, just waiting for you to come back and eat!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I…” Jiang Cheng didn’t want to go back, yet he couldn’t bring himself
        to say no. After being frozen for a moment, he was only able to say:
        “I’m at the shopping centre.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s not too far ah, just take line 19 to get back,” Li Baoguo
        immediately answered. “The stop is just on the east entrance of the
        centre.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As Jiang Cheng turned onto the street of Li Baoguo’s home with the
        clothes in his hands, he noticed that there was a dry-cleaning shop not
        too far away. It didn’t seem that reliable from the looks of it, but
        there sure was a lot of clothes hanging in the closet. Jiang Cheng
        hesitated for a moment before he decided to take Gu Fei’s clothes in for
        a wash; he even paid an express fee and was scheduled to return again
        that night for pickup.
      </p>

      <p>
        His steps came to a halt once he arrived at the bottom of the stairs.
        Parked at the hallway entrance was a pedicab loaded with glass and Li
        Baoguo was standing to its side. He unloaded a few pieces of glass from
        the cart and moved inside with some difficulty.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was probably to fill in the window that he smashed the day before.
        Jiang Cheng sighed and ran up: “Let me do it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yo, you’re back!” Li Baoguo yelled out. “Don’t move, I’ll carry it.
        Don’t end up smashing it, it was quite expensive!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked and saw that it was indeed difficult to switch hands,
        hence he took the keys from Li Baoguo and walked upfront to open the
        house door.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How understanding!” Li Baoguo raised his head and screamed up to who
        knows what. “Look at this, this is my son! He understands me so well!”
        　
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why don’t you ask the workers to install it for you?” Jiang Cheng
        looked around the room, the pieces of broken glass were still scattered
        around the floor. He brought over the broom from the kitchen, “This…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Find workers?” Li Baoguo glared at him. “How much money would that
        cost! Let me tell you, I was only able to bring back these rotten pieces
        of glass by putting it on a loan.”
      </p>

      <p>“Loan?” Jiang Cheng froze with the broomstick in hand.</p>

      <p>
        “The glass shop on the street in the back, the owner there plays cards
        with me regularly, I asked him for it,” Li Baoguo answered. “A few days
        later when I get lucky at the table, I’ll bring him the money.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng opened his mouth, yet he didn’t know what to say. Li Baoguo
        didn’t even have money for a few pieces of glass? To pay for a few
        pieces of glass, he had to rely on gambling cards?
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is it the street in the back?” He bent his back to sweep up the
        miscellaneous pieces of glass. “I’ll just go pay for it later.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Good boy!” Li Baoguo rested the glass on the table nearby and dusted
        his hands, “You know how to worry about your old geezer! Your family on
        the other side gave you quite a lot of money, right?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng turned around to look at him but didn’t utter a word.</p>

      <p>
        When Li Baoguo left to get the dumplings from the kitchen, Jiang Cheng
        grabbed the jacket that he had thrown onto the bed and fished out his
        wallet to examine – feeling utterly speechless at the moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cash was probably left untouched, but the position of the card had
        changed. He then looked at the card number, only when he was positive
        that the card remained the same did he returned his wallet back into his
        pocket. Sitting on the edge of his bed, Jiang Cheng felt feeble.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took out the cigarette box wanting to take out a cigarette but
        only found that the package was already finished.
      </p>

      <p>
        He crumbled the box into a ball with scrunched eyebrows and threw it
        onto the ground near his feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from this cigarette box, the floor was also covered with an area
        of cigarette butts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today was very quiet. Lao Xu gave him a few calls this morning, his mom
        also and Li Yan too, he ignored them all and turned off his phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        The world became quiet – he could sit alone and carefully taste the
        terror resting at the bottom of his heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sky was starting to dim, and the northern wind was blowing out of
        control. The wind would seep past hats, blow through earmuffs, swirl
        through mouth masks and sweep across their faces again and again.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned around to walk through the small path between the two rows of
        tombstones. With a broomstick in hand, he swept away the cigarette
        butts, then came to stand in front of a tombstone and stared at the
        picture on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the first time he set eyes on this photo after spending the
        whole day here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under the dimly lit sky, the person in the photo appeared especially
        unfamiliar, yet he seemed to still contain a breath of air that caused
        him to become fearful.
      </p>

      <p>“I’m leaving,” he said.</p>

      <p>
        As he turned to leave, he couldn’t shake away the feeling that there was
        someone following him from behind.Turning back to look, there was only a
        sea of silently hushed tombstones.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moving forward, his footsteps became heavy. Gu Fei took a deep breath
        and sped up.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment he dropped the broom, the sound of water rang loudly in his
        ears.
      </p>

      <p>
        His breathing seemed to have stopped, and his surroundings seemed to
        have dimmed all of a sudden.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was not the sound of flowing water, nor was it the sound of water
        being rowed, this was… the amplified sound of someone furiously
        struggling to stay alive in a pool of ruthless water – it contained
        hopelessness and pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Water splashed everywhere as the waves rose one after another,
        overlapping and collapsing without end and within the water, a pair of
        eyes were staring straight at him.
      </p>

      <p>“Why didn’t you save me?! Does your skin itch for a beating?!”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei harshly kicked the garbage can beside him while soaked in
        momentary fear. Only at the sound of the garbage can crashing to the
        floor was he finally pulled back to reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        He pulled on his jacket collar, and with his head lowered, he quickly
        walked down the vacant pathway toward the only entrance-exit gate of the
        graveyard.
      </p>

      <p>This wasn’t the last sentence he heard.</p>

      <p>
        On the day his father died, he had spent the whole night drowning in
        nightmares with this sentence repeating over and over again in his
        conscious, unable to wake up.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment before his father died, he hadn’t the time to speak nor could
        he speak – all that was left was the furious struggling for his life.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know why he would dream up such a sentence, nor did he think
        that this sentence would follow him for the rest of his years afterward
        to become his indelible fear.
      </p>

      <p>
        The feeling of standing on the lakeshore with his body soaking wet still
        felt so real, so real that he couldn’t help from grasping the edge of
        his clothes every time to ensure that they were dry.
      </p>

      <p>
        This side of the town near the cemetery was actually very prosperous,
        coming out from the front gate was the main street. Gu Fei almost
        basically ran toward the nearest convenience store.
      </p>

      <p>
        With light cascading upon him from all around, he finally felt his body
        starting to warm and the stiffness slowly beginning to dissipate.
      </p>

      <p>
        He bought two packages of cigarettes and a bottle of water then bought a
        portion of oden.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        After he lit the cigarette in a sheltered place away from the wind, he
        took a draw and extinguished it immediately – he felt like throwing up.
      </p>

      <p>He felt as though his throat was completely caked with sand.</p>

      <p>
        Once he sat down on the bus, he downed a whole bottle of water and after
        finally feeling a bit recovered, he switched on his phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        A bunch of missed calls, mostly from Lao Xu, others were all about
        unimportant things – knowing he powered off his phone, they had stopped
        calling. Only Lao Xu, like a loyal and persistent pursuer, called on
        endlessly.
      </p>

      <p>
        After browsing the missed calls, he opened the messages only to find one
        from Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>– I’ll return your clothes to you at eight.</p>

      <p>
        Seeing Jiang Cheng’s profile photo, he again thought back to yesterday
        when he was photoshopping Jiang Cheng’s photos for him. He leaned
        against the window, and without rhyme or reason, he started to laugh.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p></p>

      <p>
        The bus ride from the cemetery back home was a long one that circled
        over half the city. Gu Fei leaned against the window, allowing the bus
        to swing him around, and not two stops had passed, he was already swung
        to sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was only within a few stops before his house that he opened his eyes,
        but it was already past eight o’clock. He fished out his phone for a
        glance at the screen, Jiang Cheng hadn’t sent any messages – probably
        hadn’t arrived yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was one message from Gu Miao though, containing only three words.
      </p>

      <p>– I already ate.</p>

      <p>
        When he came home late and didn’t have time to cook dinner, the neighbor
        downstairs would set up a small table andGu Miao would go downstairs by
        herself to eat with them. At the end of the month, Gu Fei would pay them
        the bill.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, when their mother was carried away by a whim, she would also
        cook them a few meals. Their mother’s dishes were all very delicious, he
        and Gu Miao both enjoyed them, except the opportunities were rare.
      </p>

      <p>– Did you eat downstairs?</p>

      <p>– En.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei dropped his phone back into his pocket, then walked to the side
        of the door where he waited to get off the bus. This little girl was
        becoming more and more cool, even her text messages were reticent and
        words so few were cherished as gold.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eight o’clock in this old part of the town was already considered late
        for its winter season, and for these streets that were described as the
        old within the old, it was basically considered midnight. The shops
        along the streets all closed at this time, and there was rarely anyone
        outside except for those out playing cards.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Gu Fei was heading toward their family shop, he spotted someone
        standing at the entrance from quite a distance away. From the dimly
        cascading streetlight, he could tell that the person was jumping up and
        down on the pedestrian sidewalk, almost like they were dancing.
      </p>

      <p><em>Jiang Cheng?</em></p>

      <p>
        He increased his pace and walked over to see that it was indeed Jiang
        Cheng, jumping up and down the stairs of the store entrance with his
        neck shrunk into his jacket and hands dug deep in his pockets.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck!” Before he could make a sound, Jiang Cheng had already seen
        him approach. He wasn’t sure if it was due to the cold or his menacing
        tone, but his voice had lowered greatly. “Why don’t you just show up
        tomorrow!”
      </p>

      <p>
        When this last sentence escaped his mouth, Gu Fei was able to confirm
        that it was due to the coldness. Jiang Cheng’s voice quivered and there
        was also the sound of teeth clashing together.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sorry,” Gu Fei said, taking out the keys. “I was on a bus that was
        going extremely slow.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No, like,” Jiang Cheng pointed toward the shop door. “Your family
        business is looked after quite carefreely ah.”
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Gu Fei gave him a glance.</p>

      <p>
        “When the doctor from next door left, he said that you guys didn’t even
        open this afternoon,” Jiang Cheng replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is that right,” Gu Fei opened the door, the warmth from inside cascaded
        them. “It’s my mom’s turn to be here today, this afternoon… something
        probably came up and she left.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Move, move…” Jiang Cheng was right behind him as he pushed Gu Fei aside
        and stepped into the store. After jumping on the spot numerous times, he
        finally settled his butt on the chair. “Fuck, I’m freezing to death.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “When did you get here?” Gu Fei brought over an electrical heater and
        turned it on.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Seven-fifty,” Jiang Cheng casually threw the bag containing the jacket
        on the counter.
      </p>

      <p>“That early,” Gu Fei froze.</p>

      <p>
        “I,” Jiang Cheng pointed at himself. “Received an education that taught
        me to be on time from a young age.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stared at him, and only after a while did he finally say: “Why
        didn’t you tell me when you arrived?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Would you be able to suddenly appear if I told you?” Jiang Cheng
        replied. “Also, my phone got too cold – it powered off.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then why didn’t you just go back for today,” Gu Fei brought over a cup
        and dropped a slice of lemon inside, then poured a cup of hot water and
        handed it to him. “I could’ve also gone to pick it up.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why do you have so much nonsense to say,” Jiang Cheng received the cup
        and took a sip, glaring at the heater.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t continue the conversation: “I’ll return you your clothes
        tomorrow morning, I brought them home to wash.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah?” Jiang Cheng looked up at him. “It’s difficult to wash, there’s
        blood on them.”
      </p>

      <p>“It’s okay, it washed off fine,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“Thank you,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “You’re welcome,” Gu Fei sat down behind the cashier counter and propped
        his legs up on top of the counter. “It’s just that it’s too disgusting
        to leave them unwashed, and it’s not like you took them with you.”
      </p>

      <p>“… Fuck,” Jiang Cheng said. “I forgot, okay?”</p>

      <p>Neither of the two had much to say afterward.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei very comfortably nestled himself on the checkout counter and
        started to play on his phone. Jiang Cheng had no phone to play with,
        hence, he just sat there and stared blankly into space.
      </p>

      <p>
        He knew that at this time, most stores in the area – except the card
        gaming room – had already closed for the day. Gu Fei was probably
        waiting for him to leave so he could close.
      </p>

      <p>But he didn’t want to leave.</p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo’s house had been very lively today. He wasn’t sure what
        madness Li Baoguo was possessed by, but he had called over a bunch of
        people to play cards.
      </p>

      <p>
        At noon, Li Baoguo very proficiently fixed the two panels of the window
        that he had smashed open. Jiang Cheng quite marvelled at that trait – if
        one was to talk about hands-on abilities, it was their parents’
        generation that was highly skilled.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Jiang Cheng’s wandering thoughts could return back to earth, he
        didn’t have the chance to eat even ten of the dumplings that Li Baoguo
        had ‘apparently’ boiled for him when the room was suddenly crowded with
        five-six men and women.
      </p>

      <p>
        They crowded around him on four sides and stared – all sorts of prying
        and gossiping happened right in front of his face.
      </p>

      <p>How profitable, someone else raised your son to this size.</p>

      <p>Look, a child raised up in the big city sure is different ha!</p>

      <p>Your adoptive parents must be quite rich, right?</p>

      <p>
        Of course they’re rich, look at his attire and his temperament. Tsk,
        tsk, tsk…
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, a woman in the style of a middle-aged internet meme said
        this: one look and you can tell their biological relationship. Look,
        look, look at this, his features look so similar to Bao Guo ah! Exactly
        the same ah!
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was already gritting his teeth and suffocating himself to
        the shape of a bell pepper – once this sentence travelled to his ears,
        he instantly couldn’t take it anymore.
      </p>

      <p><em>Similar?</em></p>

      <p><em>Similar… to hell with you! Exactly the same my ass!</em></p>

      <p>
        He pushed aside this group of people, and only when he returned to his
        own room and slammed the door shut did they finally give up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then they finished all the dumplings in the pot, even the three
        leftovers Jiang Cheng didn’t get the chance to eat and left in his bowl
        were not spared.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt as if he was caught in moments of disbelief on a daily
        basis. To the left: fathomless, and to the right: inconceivable – he
        lived in an atmosphere where it was utterly difficult to breathe.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he walked through the hallway of the apartment complex after class
        ended in the afternoon, he could tell that those people were still there
        just from the sound alone, and based on their behaviour, it appeared
        that they didn’t have any plan to leave tonight either. Jiang Cheng
        didn’t bother to enter the doorway and made a U-turn without hesitation.
      </p>

      <p>
        He headed toward the dumpling restaurant he didn’t get the chance to go
        the other day, sent Gu Fei a message and finished his homework inside.
        In the end, with only him left, Jiang Cheng finally stood up and left.
      </p>

      <p>There was an inexplicable loneliness.</p>

      <p>
        He couldn’t return to his previous life, nor was he able to fuse into
        his current life. Drifting amongst a sea of strangers, no relatives, and
        no friends – there was not one place trustworthy enough for him to rest.
      </p>

      <p>He felt as if his entire body was pending in mid-air.</p>

      <p>
        Staring blankly for almost half an hour in Gu Fei’s shop, Jiang Cheng
        turned his head to look at Gu Fei. Like before, he had his head lowered,
        looking at his phone screen.
      </p>

      <p>“Are you waiting to close?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei stared at the screen, ignoring him.</p>

      <p>
        “If you’re in a hurry to close then I’ll leave,” Jiang Cheng continued.
        “If not, then I’ll stay for a bit longer.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei still didn’t utter a sound, nor did he move.</p>

      <p>
        <em>What is so encaptivating?</em> Jiang Cheng hesitated before he stood
        up and leaned over the counter to peek at his phone.
      </p>

      <p><em>Retarded game, Craz3 Match!</em></p>

      <p>
        “Damn,” he was not able to refrain himself from uttering.
        <em
          >How can there be such a person who plays a game like this to the
          point that they can’t hear others talk!</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        He examined this level, it was quite difficult, with only three moves
        left. If he didn’t waste any of these steps, the level could still be
        passed – Gu Fei was probably calculating his moves.
      </p>

      <p>
        He hung over the counter and calculated with him. Quickly enough, he
        determined which piece should be moved first. But based on the moral
        that a person watching chess is a true gentleman when he refrained from
        speaking, Jiang Cheng waited in silence.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei remained still the entire time.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng continued to hang over the cash counter for almost five
        minutes and Gu Fei still hadn’t moved. If the time from earlier was
        added, he had been frozen there calculating these three moves for more
        than half an hour…
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng thought back to what Lao Xu had said this morning, ‘Gu Fei,
        is actually quite smart…’ <em>This is called smart?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Unable to contain himself any longer, he stuck out a finger wanting to
        draw out a path for Gu Fei. “Can you not see this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        His fingertip had only passed the corner of Gu Fei’s eyes – not having
        even touched the screen – yet Gu Fei suddenly raised his head and
        grabbed his finger, flipping it backward in a continuous movement.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah!” Jiang Cheng yelled out loud; his movement was not too harsh,
        however, it surprised him greatly. Jiang Cheng’s anger suddenly hit the
        roof and he threw a fist right at Gu Fei’s chest. “Do you have a fucking
        problem!”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei released his hand.</p>

      <p>
        “You have problems right!” Jiang Cheng swung his hand around – thank
        goodness it was the finger on his left hand, had it been his right hand,
        the wound would have torn right open.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stood up. Jiang Cheng paid special attention to his movements,
        unable to determine if this guy had some devil flame burning within him
        and was looking for someone to fight with.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I…” Gu Fei tossed his phone to the side, brought over a cup and poured
        himself some water, “I fell asleep just now.”
      </p>

      <p>“What?” Jiang Cheng froze.</p>

      <p>“Sorry,” Gu Fei looked at his hand. “I didn’t injure you, did I?”</p>

      <p>“You sleep with your eyes open?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Then my mind must have drifted, I didn’t hear you speak.” Gu Fei sat
        back down and took a look at his phone, “Where did you say to go next?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>“Where?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“Feel it out yourself,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked down, then swiped across the screen which was soon
        followed by an “ah” sound and scrunched eyebrows.
      </p>

      <p>“Dead?” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>“Mm,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>“Are you…” Jiang Cheng swallowed the other half of the sentence.</p>

      <p>
        “Retarded?” Gu Fei finished for him. “You said I was playing a retarded
        game anyways, didn’t you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No, like, did you not see that line of horizontal red jellybeans on the
        top right corner,” Jiang Cheng said. “With that gone, there’s also
        similar colors on top, with one more move then you can get the bottom
        one…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Jiang Cheng could finish his sentence, Gu Fei nodded his head.
        “Oh.”
      </p>

      <p>Then he swiped his finger across the screen twice.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng stared at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Passed,” Gu Fei let out a breath of air, turning around to look at him.
        “Thank you.”
      </p>

      <p>“Asshole,” Jiang Cheng was speechless.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei threw his phone onto the counter and stretched his back. “Is
        there any homework for today?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Bullshit,” Jiang Cheng said. “Is there a time when you guys don’t have
        homework?”
      </p>

      <p>“Did you write it?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looked at him in silence.</p>

      <p>“Let me copy it,” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng continued to look at him. This person was asking his
        unacquainted desk-mate of two days, including one and a half in which
        they didn’t see each other, to copy his homework. And his tone wasn’t
        even the least bit entreating.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Please, give me your homework.” Gu Fei sighed, “So that I can borrow it
        to copy, thanks.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng also sighed, and after sighing, he suddenly felt the urge to
        laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s quite a lot of homework today, it’ll take you a while to copy.”
        He pulled out a few notebooks and a question sheet from his bag and
        threw them onto the counter. “Just bring it back to me tomorrow
        morning.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t need the question sheet, I don’t have it.” Gu Fei picked up the
        notebook and flipped through it, “Your calligraphy really has nothing in
        relation to being a straight-A student.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you’re gonna copy, just copy,” Jiang Cheng shot back. This sentence
        meant nothing harsh though – his calligraphy was indeed ugly to look at,
        one line of words was enough to perform a drunken fist dance. “A beggar
        disliking that the rice is coarse.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stood up and circled around the shop a few times before finally
        picking up his school bag from a small corner. Just as he laid down his
        books on the table, his phone rang.
      </p>

      <p>
        He pressed on the screen, it was a voice message, and on speaker mode
        too. Jiang Cheng, sitting to the side, heard the content loud and clear.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Ge!<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Bro… ah fuck! My mistake! Da Ge, it was
        my mistake… I’ll be as far away as… possible from now on…ah! Stop
        hitting, stop hitting! Holy fuck, stop hitting, I’m about to… die!”
      </p>

      <p>
        The person in the voice message screamed in agony and begged for
        forgiveness. Jiang Cheng froze as soon as the sound traveled to his
        ears.
      </p>

      <p>“Good enough,” Gu Fei picked up the phone and returned a message.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at him for a long moment: “That was the person you
        stuck onto the tree yesterday, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei flipped through his bag for more than ten rounds before
        eventually taking out a pen and scribbling a few times only to discover
        that there wasn’t even ink inside. He turned to look at Jiang Cheng,
        “You have a pen?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng pulled out a pen for him.</p>

      <p>
        In terms of underachievers, they also came in different levels. Pan Zhi
        was also an underachiever, but compared to Gu Fei, he was certainly a
        tender, cute little slacker; at least Pan Zhi had his own pens, and even
        more than one as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei lowered his head and started to copy his homework. He was quite
        engrossed in copying – if one didn’t know the full story, they’d think
        he was actually hardworking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sat for a while longer, and until he felt that he was no
        longer able to sit still – he couldn’t just sit there doing nothing but
        watch Gu Fei copy homework – he stood up. “I’m leaving.”
      </p>

      <p>“I thought you had nowhere else to go,” Gu Fei said while writing.</p>

      <p><em>Congratulations! You are correct!</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t reply – there was a certain helpless and shameful
        bitterness to the truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just stay here if you have nowhere to go. Li Yan, Liu Fan and the
        others all come here to lay around when they have nothing to do,” Gu Fei
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m leaving.” Realizing that he was beginning to be considered
        alongside the same standards as those ‘Bu Shi Hao Niao’ in the eyes of
        others, Jiang Cheng suddenly felt his heart congest – he almost wanted
        to spaz.
      </p>

      <p>
        He aggressively pushed aside the door curtains and smashed right into
        someone who was equally trying to get in.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Bastard!” The person he collided into was a woman, they hadn’t even
        separated from one another before she started swearing. “Bastard!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s anger was completely knocked out by the shock, his eyes
        opened wide to stare at the woman.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t block the door!” The woman pushed him aside vigorously, “Gu Fei,
        you asshole!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Her push caused Jiang Cheng to stumble and back up a couple of steps.
        Once he looked up to clearly see the woman’s features, he froze once
        again.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was no need for introductions nor a need for guessing – just from
        looking one could be certain that she was Gu Fei’s mother. Even their
        eyes and nose were exactly the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What are you spazzing about,” Gu Fei dropped his pen and stood up with
        eyebrows scrunched.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What did you do?!” The woman dove toward Gu Fei with her palm aimed at
        his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei caught her hand midair and glanced toward Jiang Cheng’s
        direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Um…” Jiang Cheng felt so awkward he didn’t even know where to land his
        eyes. “A-Yi<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>,I’ll be leaving.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What are you leaving for?!” The woman wiped her head toward Jiang Cheng
        before she charged toward him and grabbed him by the elbow. “You and
        this bastard teamed up on this, right? Don’t you leave!”
      </p>

      <p>“Wha… what?” Jiang Cheng froze on the spot.</p>

      <p>“What did you two do?!” The woman slapped him on the elbow.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t daregrab her hand as Gu Fei did. This was, after all,
        Gu Fei’s mother. All he could do was straightforwardly take in the slap.
      </p>

      <p>
        To be honest, this woman was quite beautiful, but Jiang Cheng really
        didn’t understand her current, seemingly batshit crazy state. 　　
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t you feel ashamed of yourself?” Gu Fei grabbed her arm and threw
        her onto the chair nearby, his finger pointing at her face. “I dare you
        to try and spaz again!”
      </p>

      <p>
        The woman finally stopped trying to dive toward them, yet she suddenly
        broke into tears. “Am I your mother or not, what’s wrong with me trying
        to date? You just had to beat them up until they’re too scared to even
        see me… are you that eager to see me widowed for the rest of my life!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s complexion was very unsightly, even his hands were shaking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt that if he wasn’t there right now, Gu Fei would have
        very likely slapped his mom across the face.
      </p>

      <p>
        But under such circumstances, even if he was to leave and Gu Fei’s mom
        was to be slapped, he still had to leave. He could sympathize with Gu
        Fei’s current feelings – it was the same nature as not wanting others to
        detect his relationship with Li Baoguo.
      </p>

      <p>
        He backed up a few steps towards the door, and when Gu Fei looked in his
        direction, Jiang Cheng pointed at the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei nodded his head in an exasperated manner, Jiang Cheng quickly
        lifted up the curtains and dashed outside. 　
      </p>

      <p>
        That awkward, uncomfortable atmosphere hit too close to home – only
        after the cold winter air bashed him around a few times did it gradually
        start to fade.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck, the frick’ kind of mother is that!</em></p>

      <p>
        He scrunched his eyebrows,
        <em>does this hell of a place have not one normal person?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The sound of wheels rubbing against the concrete floor came from behind
        him. This sound was very familiar, he quickly turned his head. Sure
        enough, it was Gu Miao heading toward him on her skateboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        As she passed by the shop entrance, she probably heard the voices
        inside, hesitated but did not stop. Instead, with a push against the
        ground, she flew toward him like the wind.
      </p>

      <p>
        She even waved at Jiang Cheng as she flew over. Jiang Cheng was just
        about to warn her to be careful, however, she had already leaped into
        the air with a step onto the board, flying past and solidly landing in
        front of him. With a beautiful turn of the body, she stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why didn’t you go home?” Jiang Cheng looked at her even though he knew
        she wouldn’t answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao didn’t speak. She got down from the skateboard, her foot lightly
        kicked the skateboard and the skateboard rolled beside Jiang Cheng’s
        foot.
      </p>

      <p>“Want me to skate?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>Gu Miao nodded her head and pulled lightly on her hat.</p>

      <p>
        “I do know how,” Jiang Cheng rubbed his hands together. “It’s just been
        a long time since I last did it.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao still made no sound and just continued to look at him.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng unexpectedly detected the tiniest hint of provocation
        through her gaze and couldn’t hold a smile back. “Are you challenging me
        for a match?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao leaned against the lamp post and looked at him with her arms
        crossed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yo,” Jiang Cheng threw his bag toward a pile of snow nearby and rested
        a foot on the board. “Little chick’s got quite the swag.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao lifted her chin, signaling him to hurry up.</p>

      <p>
        During elementary and middle school, Jiang Cheng actually loved playing
        with these sort of things – rollerblades and skateboards related thing.
        But due to preparations for the high school entrance exams during grade
        nine<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>, his mother erased all the topics “that had
        no relationships to studying” from his life.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took a deep breath as his foot pushed against the ground and he
        rolled out.
      </p>

      <p>
        His speed was not high, he was unfamiliar with the land formation here,
        thank goodness Gu Miao’s board was a classic skateboard – the kind he
        was most familiar with, hence it was comparatively easier to adjust to.
      </p>

      <p>
        Skating out a few meters, he heard footsteps sounding behind him. He
        turned his head to see Gu Miao running behind, and upon seeing him turn,
        Gu Miao clapped her hands simultaneously; though he was not sure if she
        was applauding for him or telling him to hurry up.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, skating on a skateboard and still having a little girl capable
        of catching up to him… was quite amusing.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao ran and skipped at the same time, performing an Ollie.</p>

      <p>
        Not wanting to lose face in front of a little girl, he shifted his
        center of balance and with one foot on the board, he jumped right over
        the snow pile in front of him – he even made the time to point a finger
        in Gu Miao’s direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao’s eyes instantly brightened. She jumped with excitement, raised
        a hand and snapped her fingers.This finger snapper of hers put Jiang
        Cheng to shame – it was really sharp.
      </p>

      <p>
        After landing, Jiang Cheng continued on until he reached the street
        intersection. This time he increased his speed, Gu Miao did not follow
        behind him, instead, she continued to stand at her previous spot to look
        at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he turned around to skate back, he risked the shame of falling on
        his face again and jumped on the stairs before coming back down – his
        luck wasn’t too bad since he didn’t fall, only his movement faltered a
        bit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Skateboards were quite the diversion strategy. With his feet on the
        board, whipping past strangers on the street like the wind, the disgust,
        boredom, and annoyance were all left behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though doing this sort of thing in the dead of winter was quite
        cold with the wind blown into his face, it still felt pretty awesome.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a slight slope to the road heading back, his speed started to
        accelerate dramatically, and the familiar excitement slowly came back.
      </p>

      <p>
        He glanced at Gu Miao, who wore an expression full of anticipation as
        she stared back at him. He returned his gaze back to the ground,
        contemplating on jumping over that large snow pile as he passed Gu Miao.
      </p>

      <p>
        The current speed was just right. Jiang Cheng rushed forward with the
        wind in his arms as he approached the snow pile rapidly.The moment he
        was preparing to jump up, he spotted a small piece of brick lying on the
        ground in front of him.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck!</em></p>

      <p>
        This brick laid on the spot that was his only path to the snowbank, with
        his current rusty skill level, it was impossible to dodge. He could only
        make an early jump, but that would mean that he would land right on the
        snow pile when he descended.
      </p>

      <p>…. it all depended on how high he could jump.</p>

      <p>With a step on the board, he firmly jumped up into the air.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, he was not so lucky this time.</p>

      <p>
        Possibly due to the cold weather, also possibly because he was too
        anxious and did not contract his legs enough either… he was already able
        to calculate his landing spot.
      </p>

      <p>
        The nose of the board would probably stick right into the peak of the
        snow pile.
      </p>

      <p>
        And as for him, he would probably smash right onto the pedestrian
        sidewalk in front of that snow pile.
      </p>

      <p><em>Come on! Fly! Youth!</em></p>

      <p>
        After being momentarily airborne, the nose directed right toward the
        snow pile as he had predicted. But the moment before he was thrown out,
        a person suddenly appeared before him.
      </p>

      <p><em>Oh shit.</em></p>

        What rule was it – saying that once you run into a red light, you will
        run into all the red lights regardless of whether you accelerate or slow
        down, you will always run into it.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Roughly applying the same concept, once you have lost face in front of
        someone, you will always lose face upon seeing them regardless of how
        careful or impossible you think it is – your “face” never belonged to
        you.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Just like now, five minutes ago Gu Fei was still pointing a finger at
        his mother like he was going to hit her, and five minutes later, he
        appeared on the sidewalk – with the help of a God – like he had rushed
        out just to see him lose face.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The time that Jiang Cheng soared in the air was relatively short, but he
        was well aware of the profound thoughts that the human brain can conjure
        in just a split second.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        For example, he knew that Gu Fei was not in the best of moods and the
        twenty pounds of thoughts that swarmed his mind could be seen in his
        expression, ready to explode at any time.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        For example, he knew that flying over in this angle would certainly make
        him collide into the extremely moody Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        For example, he knew that because of the unchanging power of this
        collision, the impact would be undeniably immense – Gu Fei would be
        knocked down.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        For example, he also knew that he should put his hand to the side right
        away, or else, when the two of them knocked against each other, the scab
        that had somewhat started to form on the hollow of his palm – with much
        difficulty – would immediately split open from the pressure.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">…</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        In short, when he spread his arms wide open as if he was rushing toward
        the sun and flew toward Gu Fei, the expression on Gu Fei’s face was
        unpredictable.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng knocked straight into Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true"><em>Bam.</em></p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        After the first time when he knew the weight of a human body could make
        such a loud sound from colliding against wood, he once more knew for the
        first time that a human colliding against another human could also
        create such a stereoscopic sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        His forehead smashed into Gu Fei’s collarbone first; his mouth knocked
        against something, in any case, his teeth seemed to have bitten into a
        zipper or something, and then he could not distinguish what happened
        after – in short, various parts of his body, whether in fast or slow
        motion, all smashed against Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t even get to stagger back when he was struck by him; his
        vision simply met the sky – he had fallen directly to the ground.
      </p>

      <p>He followed him and fell.</p>

      <p>
        When they collided, he couldn’t sense whether it hurt or not, and now
        that he had fallen to the ground it certainly did not hurt. Although Gu
        Fei was not fat, in the end, he was still the cushion beneath.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng fell to the ground, he even had the illusion that his
        surroundings were soaring with a storm of snow.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a few seconds, he determined that that was indeed an illusion;
        there was no snow underneath Gu Fei – only the tiled pavement of the
        sidewalk.
      </p>

      <p>That hard fall made the two somewhat puzzled.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng returned to his senses when he heard Gu Fei whisper, “what
        the fuck” and he used his uninjured hand to try and quickly push himself
        up: “Sor…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, his hand did not locate a proper spot and instead pressed
        into Gu Fei’s rib.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck!” Gu Fei shouted in pain, “You fucking idiot!”</p>

      <p>
        To be honest, Jiang Cheng was in quite a foul mood – the brief joy
        brought by twirling on Gu Miao’s skateboard merely cured the symptoms
        but not the root cause. Furthermore, being reduced to playing on a
        skateboard with a primary schoolkid in the middle of the night was very
        depressing, no matter how you put it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The words that Gu Fei had said just now were enough to make him a bit
        angry… but he was the one that collided against Gu Fei after all, and it
        wasn’t a soft collision either. He could even see that the zipper on Gu
        Fei’s jacket had gone missing.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck off!” Gu Fei lifted his arm and shoved him to the side.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck your uncle. I didn’t fucking do it on purpose!” Having said that,
        Jiang Cheng felt an aching sensation on his teeth; there was something
        in his mouth. He turned his head to the side and spat; out came half of
        the zipper-head.
      </p>

      <p><em>Ding.</em></p>

      <p>The sound was quite sharp and clear.</p>

      <p>
        As soon as he heard that, he suddenly felt a burst of pain and soreness
        in his mouth. He didn’t dare to think how he had actually managed to
        bite the zipper-head off; he didn’t dare to lick his front teeth to see
        if they were still there.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It must not be easy to be a pretentious prick! Stop being fake all the
        time!” Gu Fei must have not fallen lightly, evident by the
        characteristically splenetic feature on his face as he raised his hand,
        “Xueba!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck off, motherfucker,” Jiang Cheng was shoved by him until his ass
        heavily struck the ground; he immediately retorted, “Try to hit me again
        and see what happens!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t even bother to look at him as he kicked him in the
        stomach.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt that everything in the world had disappeared instantly,
        and only the bastard Gu Fei remained before him. He jumped up from the
        ground and returned a hard kick toward him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei quickly moved to the side to avoid it, and thus, Jiang Cheng’s
        kick was met with the empty air, however, he didn’t hesitate to chase
        after, and the kick swiftly landed on Gu Fei’s back.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck!” Gu Fei’s hand circled back to grab his calf.</p>

      <p>
        As Jiang Cheng fell back to the ground, his other feet did not forget to
        swing toward Gu Fei’s face for a mighty good connection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei used his arm to block and then pounced over and straddled him,
        punching him in the face.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Motherfucker! He’s fucking strong!</em>
        <em>Fucking piece of shit!</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        A string of golden clovers similar to the lights of a small train
        flashed before Jiang Cheng’s left eye, but he ignored everything and
        lifted his hand, swinging it ruthlessly toward Gu Fei’s chin – Gu Fei’s
        face flew upward.
      </p>

      <p>
        He used the opportunity to jab Gu Fei in the ribs… but was unsuccessful
        as Gu Fei quickly grabbed his wrist.
      </p>

      <p>
        This next move was something that he really didn’t expect; his index
        finger pressed firmly into the wound on his palm.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah——” Jiang Cheng roared, that firm press was similar to turning on a
        power switch; he suddenly bent his leg and smashed his knee on Gu Fei’s
        back.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei leaned forward and rested his hand on the side of his head.</p>

      <p>
        <em>Playing dirty, playing retarded huh, fine!</em> He tilted his head
        and bit Gu Fei’s wrist.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ahhh!” Gu Fei also yelled out in pain, and since he had bitten him
        without letting go, Gu Fei could only quickly pinch his cheek.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>This dog</em> | <em>his fucking hand is pretty strong</em>, Jiang
        Cheng felt his pinched cheeks being thoroughly pierced and a wave of
        intense soreness and pain was quick to follow suit.
      </p>

      <p>
        But at this moment, he was certain that his front teeth still existed,
        not only were they there, they were fairly prepared and strong – to say
        the least.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as the fight developed toward a stalemate to that of an idiotic
        nature, and the two fought on the ground ratherinseparably, a voice
        sounded from the side: “Gu Fei?”
      </p>

      <p>
        With the two in the midst of such a lively fight, they did not relax the
        slightest even though they both heard the voice; instead, they continued
        on very seriously with ‘<em>you hit me, I’ll swing back</em>’.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei!” The person bellowed in rage and then paused and shouted from
        the depth of his throat once more, “Jiang Cheng? What… get up! Both of
        you, get up now!”
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, Jiang Cheng had already figured out that it was Lao Xu’s voice
        the first time, but he didn’t have the time to wonder for what reasons
        Lao Xu would suddenly appear here, right now.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Both of you stop it!” Lao Xu came over and gave the two of them a kick
        each, “What are you two doing, what is this?! Haven’t you had enough!”
      </p>

      <p>The two finally stopped at the same time.</p>

      <p>
        But they only stopped; it was as if a pause button had been pressed and
        their actions were maintained.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was grasping Jiang Cheng’s collar with one hand while his other
        hand was being grasped by him; both were semi-kneeling, semi-propped up
        in a deadlock, neither daring to give up easily. After the firm press in
        the palm and the bite on the wrist,
        <em>would the opponent employ any other childish-elementary tricks</em>
        – the two could not determine this with certainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let go!” Lao Xu yanked at their arms for some time until they were
        finally separated.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s this all about!” Lao Xi stared at Gu Fei, “How can you fight
        with even your deskmate?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did you <em>only see</em> <em>me</em> hitting him?” Gu Fei wiped the
        corner of his mouth, “Are you blind?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu did not care about Gu Fei’s angry words at all as he turned to
        look at Jiang Cheng, “And what’s the matter with you? You’re a good kid,
        why are you fighting with others?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I said,” Jiang Cheng shook his hand, there wasn’t any acute pain –
        <em>it’s numb</em>. “Don’t judge a person by their grades, none of my
        teachers had ever said that I was a good kid.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey!” Lao Xu sighed, pointed to the opposite side of the road and said
        to Gu Fei, “That’s your sister! Look, you’ve scared the little girl
        until she ran off over there!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng, at this moment, remembered that Gu Miao was still nearby;
        he suddenly felt a bit uneasy, however, when he turned around, he froze.
        Gu Miao sat alone on a stone seat across the street, holding her cheeks
        in both her hands while calmly looking over.
      </p>

      <p>
        Or rather, it wasn’t ‘calmly’, it was indifferent – not a care in the
        world.
      </p>

      <p>“She’s not afraid of fights,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng no longer said anything,
        <em>Gu Miao is indeed a bit strange… </em>Gu Fei had previously blocked
        Gu Miao’s line of sight from his injured hand with much care before,
        <em>Gu Miao must be scared of blood.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        But now that he and Gu Fei had fought until this piece of land was
        practically swept clean, she was unexpectedly indifferent. Jiang Cheng
        recalled the time Gu Fei had that person plastered against the tree –
        she was eating without even raising her head.
      </p>

      <p><em>What’s wrong with this little girl?</em>　</p>

      <p>
        “Both of you, tidy up,” Lao Xu said, unable to ask anything out of the
        two of them as he pointed at their schoolbags on the ground. “I just so
        happen to come by for a home visit. We’ll discuss the fight between you
        two first.”
      </p>

      <p><em>Home visit?</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was somewhat startled, a homeroom teacher still out on home
        visits after nine o’clock while braving the old northern wind… he
        honestly didn’t know what else to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Going to whose house for a home visit?” Gu Fei adjusted his clothes,
        but when he lowered his head to pull up the zipper, he discovered that
        the zipper-head was missing. He turned to look at Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng glared back at him.</p>

      <p><em>The fuck you looking at, I ate it!</em></p>

      <p>
        “I’ve already walked here, whose house do you think I’ll go to,” Lao Xu
        sighed, “Of course, it’s yours.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei went silent for a while then turned to walk back: “Then, let’s
        go.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wait a minute,” Lao Xu probably didn’t expect him to be so
        straightforward, “I also want to know why the two of you were fighting.”
      </p>

      <p>“Boredom,” Gu Fei looked back at him, “Are you going or not?”</p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu wasn’t sure whether he should go for the home visit first or
        resolve the fight between them. Thus, he would take a step forward only
        to then stop and take a step back, think about it and move forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m heading back,” Jiang Cheng wanted to beat him to it, “Thank you, Xu
        Zong.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Without waiting for Lao Xu to speak, Jiang Cheng turned and walked off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei whistled from behind him. Jiang Cheng didn’t turn back, reckoning
        that he was calling for Gu Miao, and sure enough, he immediately heard
        the wheels on Gu Miao’s skateboard rolling on the ground.
      </p>

      <p>He sighed softly, <em>tonight was quite… good.</em></p>

      <p>
        The gambling get-together at Li Baoguo’s place was still going on; for
        these people who were immersed in front of the table for a long-extended
        period of time, it appeared as if their entire life remained only before
        that square foot, and the griping curiosities and gossips could not
        rival at all those dozen or so cards that shuffled back and forth.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the short observation and comments that took place around him in
        the afternoon, Jiang Cheng disappeared from their field of vision. Now
        that he had returned, there wasn’t so much a glance in his direction
        from anyone and only Li Baoguo said: “You’re back? We’ve already had a
        lunchbox, what do you want to eat?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You don’t need to worry about me,” Jiang Cheng said and went inside his
        room.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took off his jacket only to see that it was covered in dirt and two
        damaged areas.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck,</em> he frowned, <em>I just bought this today!</em></p>

      <p>
        Reckoning that his face wasn’t in the best condition either, he circled
        the room twice and discovered there wasn’t even a mirror anywhere; with
        that, he took out his cellphone and tried to turn it on.
      </p>

      <p>
        After receiving some warmth, it successfully booted. He turned the
        camera toward his own face and looked at himself. There was a swollen
        spot on his forehead though not serious and a small cut on his lower lip
        – probably from when it had smashed against Gu Fei’s zipper.
      </p>

      <p>Everywhere else was fine with only minor scrapes.</p>

      <p>He sighed, unsure of how he felt now. 　</p>

      <p>
        In fact, the fight was a little… reckless. It was reasonable to say that
        he also did not usually fight like that – frolicking in the mud with a
        pig, that is; it felt even more like he, himself, was venting.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wasn’t certain to what extent he wanted to fight with Gu Fei; he
        <em>just</em> wanted to fight, to tear apart, and struggle free of the
        shackles wrapping securely around his body – the kind that could not be
        seen, could not be touched or even what it was binding.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for Gu Fei, he did not know whether he was led by him… for someone
        that could single-handedly swing his fist to also unexpectedly roll on
        the ground completely without style, and bit into a palm –
        <em>fuck</em>! Why weren’t those lackeys of his there to witness it!
      </p>

      <p><em>Hey, your boss is an earthworm rolling on the ground!</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked down at his own hand only to see that the blood had
        already seeped through the gauze.
      </p>

      <p>
        He rummaged through his schoolbag – earlier in the day, he had taken
        some alcohol pads, cotton balls and whatnots from the neighborhood
        hospital – fortunately, they were not crushed.
      </p>

      <p>
        He unwrapped the gauze and used his left hand to rinse his right hand
        clean and disinfect it – albeit rather slowly and with some efforts.
        However, because he was unskilled with his left hand, he poked at the
        wound a few times, and the immense pain that conjured nearly provoked
        tears to slide down his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        He truly wanted to cry. Though he had unfailingly felt that crying was
        pointless, it <em>had</em> been quite a long time since he arrived
        <em>here</em> after vacation; from time to time, he would feel so
        overwhelmingly depressed that he wanted to cry.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had always felt that one day he should find a place completely void
        of human presence and let his tears run loose – wildly, fiercely.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he woke up in the morning, the gambling get-together had finally
        ended though there were two men sleeping on the sofa in the living room
        and Li Baoguo was snoring on the bed; earth-shattering indeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without stopping for even a second after he finished washing up, he
        picked up his schoolbag and left.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before arriving at school, a call from the distribution center came
        again: “It’s been three days, and tomorrow will be the last day. If you
        don’t come to get it, there will be a fee, you know!”
      </p>

      <p>“Can you delivery it?” Jiang Cheng sighed.</p>

      <p>
        “We can. For 200 yuan we can drop it off downstairs,” the other person
        said. “There’s an additional fee if you need it brought upstairs.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not speak. He unexpectedly started to feel sorry about
        the money and beyond gratified.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I think it’s best for you to come and get it yourself,” the other
        person sounded pretty considerate, “We have many three-wheelers here and
        to get one to deliver is a separate 100 yuan.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay, I got it,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p><em>It’s Saturday tomorrow, that’s good.</em></p>

      <p>
        Thinking about it again, he felt a little worried; his current bedroom
        had a bed and a wardrobe that occupied nearly the entire space, and the
        desk was crammed in with much effort. He wasn’t sure where all those
        other things of his were going to be placed.
      </p>

      <p>
        … perhaps his mother didn’t pack everything –
        <em>maybe not that much</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was still wearing a mask as he walked into the classroom, and the
        swelling on his forehead that had disappeared quite a bit was partly
        covered by his hair which made it impossible to see; the clothes he wore
        today weren’t Gu Fei’s either, so he walked straight to his seat and sat
        down without anyone noticing anything unusual about him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Who knew what Lao Xu had said to Gu Fei during yesterday’s home visit,
        but Gu Fei magically entered the classroom right before the morning bell
        sounded.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looked up at him only to be immediately stunned.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t have any injury on his face whatsoever; there was only a
        tiny scrape at the side of his chin… what stunned him also was that this
        fucker was actually wearing glasses!
      </p>

      <p><em>Shit! What are you pretending to be a xueba for, huh!!</em></p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng glared at him.</p>

      <p>
        Even stranger was that everyone who saw Gu Fei wasn’t surprised in the
        least, this meant that perhaps he… frequently wore glasses?
      </p>

      <p>
        This reminded him of Pan Zhi, who was slightly shortsighted but was
        persistent in not wearing glasses.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is it even right for me to wear glasses with such grades!” Pan Zhi had
        said, “I’d rather not see clearly!”
      </p>

      <p>Just look at how ambitious Pan Zhi was, he even had several pens…</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei walked over and threw a bag in front of him before he then sat
        down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng opened the bag for a look, inside was his sweater and school
        assignments.
      </p>

      <p><em>Shit! The assignments!</em></p>

      <p>
        He had actually forgotten to get back his assignments after the fight
        yesterday!
      </p>

      <p>
        … fought the person and also let him copy the assignments,
        <em>that’s so fucked up</em>.
      </p>

      <p>“The swelling hasn’t subsided huh?” Gu Fei said from the side.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng turned to look at him, trying to discern whether he was
        apologetic or rejoicing with that tone, but he was unsuccessful. Gu Fei
        said that sentence just like how that day was Friday – with not a hint
        of emotions whatsoever. Thus he did not reply.
      </p>

      <p>“Da Fei,” Zhou Jing leaned on their desks, “Da Fei!”</p>

      <p>Gu Fei pushed up his glasses to look at him.</p>

      <p>“Da Fei?” Zhou Jing turned to the side, “Hey Da Fei…”</p>

      <p>Gu Fei slapped the back of his head.</p>

      <p>
        “Why didn’t you come yesterday? Did you go out to play?” Zhou Jing
        asked, touching the back of his head.
      </p>

      <p>“No,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “I thought you were being like how you were last semester, cutting
        classes to go on trips,” Zhou Jing said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei sighed and looked at him: “You would cut a day of class for a
        trip?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… that’s true, a day wouldn’t be enough time,” Zhou Jing said, “Hey
        you…”
      </p>

      <p>“Piss off,” Gu Fei used this simple conclusion.</p>

      <p>
        The classes that days was no different from the previous two days; the
        teacher was solely engrossed in lecturing to himself and the students,
        absorbed in their own games – an auspicious and peaceful batch indeed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was also the same as usual; first, he played that same game and
        then after he ran out of lives, he put on his earphones and started to
        watch some videos.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not hold back as his eyes swept toward him several
        times.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was the kind of person who, if you did not look at his eyes,
        would give others a feeling that he was actually quite gentle, and the
        manner in which he dressed was both comfortable and tonal; with those
        glasses on, he simply seemed like what he was not: a real xueba.
      </p>

      <p>
        In truth, Jiang Cheng was a bit shocked by this inscrutable trait of
        his.
      </p>

      <p>
        After looking at him a few times, he returned his attention back to the
        teacher because no matter how horrible the teacher’s lecture was, he had
        to listen, and regardless of whether he was lying on his desk
        half-asleep and half-awake, he had to listen to the key point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had never admitted that he was the kind of person who could
        do well in exams without studying since he was quite clear about how
        much time he spent studying. But in the current classroom environment,
        wrapped in this type of learning atmosphere, it actually made him a
        little nervous.He didn’t cherish his grades much in his previous school,
        but he absolutely did not want them to be dragged down after
        transferring to Si Zhong.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the last class of the day that was English, Lao Lu’s passion radiated
        all around – perhaps, because tomorrow was the weekend, and everyone was
        somewhat absent-minded that he wanted to wake them up.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, Jiang Cheng was very seriously taking note, even if he was
        half-lying on the desk.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s talk about today’s assignment!” Lao Lu’s said just before class
        ended while slapping the desk, “All your assignments can go and open an
        exhibition! Such a simple assignment yet there are a hundred types of
        answers!”
      </p>

      <p>“Our class doesn’t have a hundred people,” Wang Xu answered.</p>

      <p>The whole class laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “You! Wang Xuri!” Lao Lu pointed his pointer at him, “The
        good-for-nothing is you! If all your organs were atrophied, your mouth
        would certainly remain!”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
      </p>

      <p>Wang Xu pushed the desk, somewhat in a bad mood.</p>

      <p>
        “Unhappy huh, come to my office after class!” Lao Lu roared and then
        without waiting for Wang Xu to any sort of reaction, his pointer went
        toward Jiang Cheng’s direction – even pointing this way and jabbing that
        way. “Gu Fei!”
      </p>

      <p>“Here,” Gu Fei looked up.</p>

      <p>
        “Tell me, do you have a problem! You copied the assignment, didn’t you?
        It must be copied!” Lao Lu said successively, “Did you copy it?! You can
        say it, you copied it! Did you?!”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei waited for a long while without finding a gap to answer him.</p>

      <p>
        “You copied the assignment! If you’re going to copy it, be a bit more
        proficient, alright? Alright?!” Lao Lu slapped the desk, “You’ve copied
        all the answers correctly, not even one wrong! Not even one! Tell me!
        Who did you copy!”
      </p>

      <p>This time, he actually gave Gu Fei time to reply.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was silent for a moment and then raised his finger and pointed at
        Zhou Jing: “Him.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Zhou Jing!” Lao Lu bellowed in rage immediately, pointing at Zhou Jing,
        “You’re quite amazing ah! How about adding a comment about you taking
        pleasure in helping people in your evaluation for this semester?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Zhou Jing was startled as he turned to look at Gu Fei, who was pointing
        at him – he opened his mouth, but no words came out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Lu grabbed the assignments while cursing and he continued to curse
        until class ended; he swung the pointer under his arm and walked out of
        the classroom.
      </p>

      <p>“Shit,” Zhou Jing turned around, “Who did you copy, huh?”</p>

      <p>Gu Fei glanced at him without saying anything.</p>

      <p>
        Zhou Jing was determined for a minute then stood up: “Forget it, who
        cares.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After Zhou Jing left, Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Fei, not knowing what he
        should say.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Er Miao will be waiting at the schoolgate in a bit,” Gu Fei said as he
        fixed his schoolbag, “You should go with her.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En?” Jiang Cheng froze, “I just fought with her brother, I don’t want
        to go with her.”
      </p>

      <p>“Just try,”Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“Okay, fuck,” Jiang Cheng was a little angry. “Then, I’ll try.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei did not speak; after a moment, he took a deep breath: “Do me a
        favor, thanks.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh, you must be suffering hard huh.” Jiang Cheng suddenly felt relief.
      </p>

      <p>“Yeah,” Gu Fei said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p></p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng and Gu Fei exited the school gates one after another,
        he really wanted to tell Gu Fei,
        <em>I’m doing it for Gu Miao, not you</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Gu Fei didn’t turn back to look at him at all, so he didn’t get the
        chance to say anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they finally stood next to each other, there was also no chance to
        say much either. Gu Miao was sitting on the pedestrian fence with her
        skateboard in her arms and legs that were busy swinging side to side.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she spotted them approaching, she instantly jumped down and threw
        her board on the ground in front of her. Then with a few light jogs, she
        leaped onto the moving board and appeared before them, reaching her
        hands into Gu Fei’s pocket, grabbing out a handful of candy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared and watched Gu Miao picked out only the fruit candies
        from the pile of candies.
      </p>

      <p>
        These candies were actually prepared for our little friend Gu Miao on a
        daily basis?
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao peeled open a candy wrapper and popped it into her mouth. She
        then dashed out in the other direction on her skateboard, moving on the
        very edge of the pedestrian sidewalk – plausibly considering to not bump
        into other people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng could only watch from behind. Even though Gu Miao was quite
        agile with top-notch skills, in the end, she was still an elementary
        school student…yet her brother actually turned around to fetch his own
        bike, not even giving a single glance in her direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao skated ahead for a good moment before stopping and turning
        around to look back at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What is it?” Jiang Cheng hurried a few steps to catch up beside her.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao jumped off the skateboard and moved to the side.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng really wanted to say to her that ‘the fight with your
        brother yesterday has left me sore all over’, and that he had no will to
        skate, but seeing Gu Miao stare back at him with her large round eyes,
        he couldn’t bring himself to disappoint her.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sure,” he sighed, took a step onto the board and slowly started to
        slide out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank goodness that after a turn away from the main street onto the next
        street, there were fewer people.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao ran along behind him, suddenly clapping her hand.</p>

      <p>
        When he turned his head, Gu Miao ran even faster towards him, making a
        hand gesture as she ran, telling him to get off.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You sure know how to play…” He understood Gu Miao’s intention and
        jumped off the skateboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao arrived beside him just in time and with a leap, she landed
        right on the board – borrowing energy from this moment of inertia, she
        zoomed out onto the street. With a few more kicks of her feet, she then
        turned around to look back at Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah…” Jiang Cheng was really quite tired, but he still ran forward. “Why
        don’t you ask your brother to do this sort of thing with you…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao jumped off the board. He immediately followed suit and jumped on
        the still moving board and continued down the road.
      </p>

      <p>Just like this, they continued down the street one after another.</p>

      <p>
        It was actually quite fun, Gu Miao didn’t speak, neither did she need
        him to speak, he only needed to cooperate with her. The point was that
        her skills were superb, Jiang Cheng didn’t even have to worry about the
        chances of her falling.　　
      </p>

      <p>
        During the entire time, Gu Fei rode his bike a few dozens of meters
        behind them with one leg sweeping along the ground as he maneuvered
        forward, rhythmically staggering in a fast and slow pace while playing
        on his phone and not looking at the road – not looking at his little
        sister.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was waiting, hoping he would fall into some sewer that was
        missing a cover – then he could clap.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately for him, even though this defeated little old city was
        rotten, its management was quite good; there wasn’t even a single brick
        missing on the pedestrian sidewalk. Gu Fei arrived on the street they
        lived at, safe and sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay,” Jiang Cheng jumped off the skateboard with a body full of sweat
        from running. “I’m going to head back the other way.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao stepped onto her skateboard and waved goodbye.</p>

      <p>He also waved back.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao put her hand in between her mouth and whistled. Gu Fei looked up
        and his eyes swept her way and then with a sudden kick on the pedal, his
        bicycle flew out. As it was passing by her side, she reached out a hand
        toward the backseat – looking as though she was gliding on ice, she was
        pulled away by Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>“… lift off.” Jiang Cheng looked after them speechless.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei probably didn’t have a father, his mother’s conditions made it
        hard to judge, so Gu Miao was most likely raised like a dog by Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the same situation was placed in his family, and his mother caught
        sight of someone’s brother raising up his little sister like this, she
        could probably talk about it for half a year.
      </p>

      <p>
        …some things were like an obsessive-compulsive disorder, you would
        uncontrollably think back to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng raised his head and vigorously sucked in a lung-full of cold
        air, only then did he feel himself relax a bit.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once he arrived at Li Baoguo’s house, the card players were no longer
        here yet the living room was a wild mess; the uncollected cards and
        scattered ashtrays left on the table made him sick with just one glance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng entered the kitchen. He couldn’t order take-out for every
        meal, and since he no longer had an allowance to spend, there was only
        money going out and none coming in: he had to be conservative.
      </p>

      <p>
        He immediately wanted to smash things when he stepped into the kitchen.
        After Li Baoguo made those dumplings yesterday, he left everything
        laying out in the open, nothing was washed and nothing was put away, and
        there was still half a pot of leftover soup sitting there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wanted to wash the pot but just as he picked it up, he
        immediately froze on the spot.
      </p>

      <p>A cockroach had drowned in the soup.</p>

      <p>
        This scene stunned him to the point that he couldn’t even throw up from
        disgust. Just like this, he stood still in the kitchen with the pot in
        his hand as if his whole body was covered with crawling insects. He felt
        a disgusting itch spread throughout him from the mere thought of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        He must have stood there for two minutes until finally, with gritted
        teeth, he dumped the noodle soup into the toilet. He then put the pot on
        the floor and pointed the water hose at it for a long time to rinse it
        clean, and then with the detergent, he aggressively rubbed at it before
        he finally filled it with water and placed it onto the stove to boil.
      </p>

      <p>
        He left the gas blazing even after the water started to boil as he
        stared at the rolling water until the last bits of the cockroach remains
        vanished along with the steam. Dumping the water down the sink, he then
        boiled another pot of water, preparing to make himself a bowl of
        noodles.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a fridge in the kitchen, a stench flew out as the door opened.
        There were only a few red peppers inside, and based on its appearance,
        they must have been in there for at least a month.
      </p>

      <p>No meat, no eggs – there was nothing.</p>

      <p>
        <em>Fuck!</em>
        <em
          >Was the meat that Li Baoguo used to make the dumplings measured
          accordingly with a weight? Not a cent overpaid!</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Facing the pot of water, Jiang Cheng fell into a momentary daze before
        he eventually turned off the gas.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Jiang Cheng carried out a furious mind-battle between the choices
        of eating out, ordering takeout or going out and buying some vegetables
        so he could come back and make his noodles – he chose the latter.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had no ability to change the current environment he lived in, the
        only thing he could do was to adapt. Though it sounded easy, to actually
        perform it was as hard as reaching the sky.
      </p>

      <p>
        He picked up his wallet and cell phone, then left the house to buy
        groceries.
      </p>

      <p>
        He should have gone to the market, yet… he had only been here for a
        while and had passed through the majority of the streets, but he really
        had yet to spot a grocery market anywhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wanted to ask a pedestrian for directions, but even after he arrived
        at the end of the road, there wasn’t a single person in sight. It was
        lunchtime right now; everyone was probably idling at home.
      </p>

      <p>He glanced at the street next to him with scrunched eyebrows.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei family’s slightly fake-looking market definitely had what he
        needed. Even if there were no leafy vegetables, there should at least be
        something along the lines of sausages, canned fish…was it because he had
        been living too miserably lately that thinking about these things, he
        actually had to swallow back his saliva – he was hungry.
      </p>

      <p><em>Jiang Cheng just look at how promising your future is!</em></p>

      <p>
        After completing his self-reflection, Jiang Cheng made a turn onto the
        street beside him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was developing a psychological trauma from constantly
        lifting up the curtains to Gu Fei’s family shop – it felt very awkward
        every sing time. After that one fight, they had only spoken three
        sentences to each other, yet here he was, running here to buy groceries
        – that was even more… awkward.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the curtains lifted up, he instantly felt a cluster of eyes fall upon
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was actually no awkwardness from this, except he was almost scared
        off his feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seven people, fourteen eyes, the Gu’s siblings plus Bu Shi Hao Niao, and
        Li Yan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei seemed a bit surprised. With chopsticks in his hand, he turned
        around to look at him without a word, and since he didn’t make a sound,
        neither did Bu Shi Hao Niao or Li Yan.
      </p>

      <p>Only Gu Miao stood up and waved her hand at him.</p>

      <p>He gave Gu Miao a smile and walked inside: “I’m buying some stuff.”</p>

      <p>“Go ahead and get what you need,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Just… sausages and whatnots, where are they?” Jiang Cheng looked on
        inside, Gu Fei’s family shop was fairly large with numerous rows of
        shelves placed side by side.
      </p>

      <p>“The row next to the window, at the very end,” Li Yan answered him.</p>

      <p>“Thanks,” Jiang Cheng glanced at him and walked inside.</p>

      <p>
        There was quite the variety to choose from: hot dogs, sausages, sliced
        red sausages; he took one of each and then also grabbed a can of marbled
        pork and a can of fish.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took a few steps over to the register, but after giving it some
        thought, he rounded back to the shelves and grabbed all sorts of spices
        and seasonings. Li Baoguo’s kitchen was just too horrifying to imagine.
        Indeed, he had developed a psychological fear toward everything in it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Getting everything all at once,” Li Yan stood behind the cash register,
        talking as he rang up the bill. “Gonna cook?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng hesitated momentarily, “Are there…pots and pans?”</p>

      <p>
        “Pots?” Li Yan blinked, then looked toward Gu Fei’s direction. “You have
        pots?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei also blinked, then stood up: “What pot?”</p>

      <p>“‘Just…pans for stir fry, pots for soup.” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>
        “Yeah,” Gu Fei said. “But the ones sold in the shopping center have
        better quality.”
      </p>

      <p>“‘It’s fine, as long as you have them,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at him then turned to walk to the far back corner and from
        a pile of buckets and tubs, he pulled out two pots, one frying pan, and
        one soup pot. Gu Fei waved them in front of him: “This size?”
      </p>

      <p>“Sure,” Jiang Cheng nodded and took them from Gu Fei.　</p>

      <p>
        “Why not just eat with us,” Li Yan leaned against the cash register.
        “It’s only a matter of adding another chopstick.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took out his wallet and thought that Li Yan’s words were
        quite kind, but as he lifted his gaze, he realized Li Yan’s eyes held
        some not-so-friendly aggression.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was most annoyed by the type of person who would randomly
        work up a fit of anger toward him. He pulled out some cash and threw
        them on the counter, and then with hands pushing against the counter, he
        stared back at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “‘Your eyeball is about to fall out,” Gu Fei walked over and sat back
        down on his stool, “Take the money.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Yan gave him another look before he moved his gaze away and picked up
        the money before staring at him some more as he handed him the change.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng could see that Li Yan had no intention of getting him a bag,
        hence, he eyed the side of the cash register and pulled out two plastic
        grocery bags from the nail that hang at a bundle, put the things inside
        and turned around to walk out the door.
      </p>

      <p>“Do you have a problem,” Liu Fan looked at Li Yan.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t have a problem,” Li Yan sat down, picked up a bottle and
        swallowed a gulp of beer. “I don’t know why either, the kid just doesn’t
        fit right with me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh, because he doesn’t fit right ah?” Liu Fan said. “For someone who
        didn’t know better, they might’ve thought you fell in love at first
        sight, with the way you were staring so intently I thought you were
        gonna lick him.”
      </p>

      <p>“Do you know how to have a conversation?” Li Yan glared at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Yan Ge isn’t in a good mood today ah,” Luo Yu laughingly said as he
        gnawed on a rib.
      </p>

      <p>
        “And how’s that your business,” Li Yan eyed him. “Remember that I made
        this meal. If you don’t want to eat your food nicely then you can go to
        the backyard and boil yourself some noodles.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey, I’ll say, the large bones you bought today are seriously good Li
        Yan,” Liu Fan said. “Fresh.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I got my mom to buy them,” Li Yan said. “I kept on wanting to eat meat
        because of the cold weather that my eyes were shooting out green
        light…Er Miao wipe the oil from your mouth, you’re a pretty little
        beauty at the very least, watch your image a bit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao grabbed a napkin and swiped it over her mouth, lowered her head
        and continued to eat.
      </p>

      <p>“Oh right, that person didn’t come back right?” Liu Fan asked.</p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei dropped some vegetables into Gu Miao’s bowl.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao picked up the vegetables, wanting to drop them into Li Yan’s
        bowl, but Gu Fei’s chopstick immediately gripped onto her chopsticks:
        “Your face is so dry that the skin is peeling off.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao could only drawback her hands and stuff the leafy greens into
        her mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your skin must be peeling because you probably don’t use facial care,”
        Li Yan maneuvered over and looked at Gu Miao’s face. “Er Miao, have you
        been using the facial cream Yan Ge brought you last time?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao didn’t respond.</p>

      <p>“She thinks it’s too much of a hassle,” Gu Fei answered for her.</p>

      <p>
        Li Yan <em>tsk-</em>ed: “Where did this rough personality come from,
        your mom, your brother or…”
      </p>

      <p>
        He stopped mid-sentence and was stuck on the spot for quite a bit, then
        picked up a single strand of vermicelli and put it into his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>“It’s fine,” Gu a Fei took a sip of soup. 　</p>

      <p>　</p>

      <p>
        Li Yan bought groceries and prepared their meal today. Having a couple
        of loafers as friends had its benefits – when their mother was
        unreliable, they would be there to help.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei didn’t skip class, his mother would usually be in the store.
        But within a week, there would be at least two days where she wouldn’t
        stay for more than half the day, and during those times, Li Yan would
        come in to fill the spot, to look after the shop as well as cook them a
        meal.
      </p>

      <p>
        The dishes weren’t exactly that great: it was just a matter of throwing
        a bunch of different vegetables together and randomly boiling them in a
        pot; they all tasted exactly the same, yet he was still willing to buy
        the groceries. Every time the pot was stuffed to the point the food
        could no longer be contained, they had to call over the other guys to
        eat along with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        After dinner Liu Fan and the others left, leaving only Li Yan leaning
        against a chair with his head raised and his hand rubbing his belly: “Er
        Miao, leave the dishes for me to wash, Yan Ge needs to digest, I ate too
        much.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao picked up the skateboard and looked at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>“… go ahead.” Gu Fei was somewhat helpless.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao’s passion for the skateboard was like an obsession, she was only
        a step away from hugging the piece of board to sleep. 　　
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei.” After Gu Miao left, Li Yan opened his eyes and looked at Gu
        Fei, “When the weather warms up, let’s go hang out<a href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
        somewhere.”
      </p>

      <p>“Go where,” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t know, how ‘bout asking Xin-<em>jie</em>,” Li Yan said. “Go out
        somewhere with her band.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Forget it,” Gu Fei lit a cigarette and dangled it in his mouth. “I
        don’t plan on going out any time soon, I still have a record of bad
        behavior that hasn’t been removed.”
      </p>

      <p>“And you care about that?” Li Yan laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “I have to get the graduation certificate, at the least.” Gu Fei
        replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If your relationship with this xueba gets even closer, you might even
        be accepted into a good university,” Li Yan looked at him.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei eyed him: “There’s shit in your brain, right?”</p>

      <p>
        “Actually,” Li Yan thought carefully while looking up at the ceiling,
        “If that guy wasn’t so arrogant and self-contained…he’d actually be
        quite charismatic.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t speak.</p>

      <p>“I quite like this type,” Li Yan added.</p>

      <p>
        “With this type, you would be beaten up until not a speck of you was
        left,” Gu Fei said. “Idiot.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The pattern has grown unclear,” Li Yan looked at his hair. “Wanna fix
        it a bit?”
      </p>

      <p>“Are you uncomfortably bored,” Gu Fei blew out a mouthful of smoke.</p>

      <p>“Yes,” Li Yan nodded his head.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei repositioned the chair and turned with his back to him.</p>

      <p>
        Li Yan took out a toolbox from under the cash counter: “How long do you
        plan on keeping this pattern for, do you want to change to a new one?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No,” Gu Fei turned his head to the side and leaned against the
        backrest.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ding Zhuxin really is your goddess,” Li Yan took out the tools and very
        carefully started to trim the rest symbol on the left side of his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        “My goddess is Gu Miao,” Gu Fei said. “Quit putting me and Xin-<em
          >jie</em
        >
        together, especially in front of her.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah, I know,” Li Yan nodded. “You’re not her little follower anymore,
        you also no longer look up to her, you just quit liking women
        altogether.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei wanted to laugh: “Is she paying you salary?”</p>

      <p>
        “No, I just think she’s quite silly when she clearly knows that you…yet
        she still likes a thing like you,” Li Yan sighed. “Even changing her
        name, who knows what she’s thinking.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t speak.</p>

      <p>
        Ding Zhuxin’s name used to be Zhuyin, later she changed it herself to
        Zhu ‘Xin’.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>
      </p>

      <p>‘Bamboos’ had no center.</p>

      <p><em>Yeah, what was she thinking.</em></p>

      <p>
        When he was young, he quite worshipped Ding Zhuxin, thinking that she
        was really cool and unrestrained by life. During the few years that he
        was helpless and disoriented, the support that Ding Zhuxin gave him
        greatly outweighed what his own mother was able to offer. Even now, he
        still held great appreciation toward her character, yet he could never
        have foreseen for so many things to change – these changes would occur
        bit by bit and when he had finally awakened to his surroundings,
        everything around him had taken on an indistinguishable new appearance.
      </p>

      <p>
        With his phone in hand, Jiang Cheng fussed with the GPS for an hour
        before finally arriving in front of the storage company that had
        previously called.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the staff pulled his things out on a flat cart, he was greatly
        startled – numerous huge boxes piled up to form a small mountain.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Have a look and verify them, they’re all numbered,” the worker handed
        him a list.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng quickly went out to find a moving truck after he signed the
        papers, but the driver was unwilling to help him lift the boxes onto the
        vehicle, not even when money was offered. Jiang Cheng had no choice but
        to use his one and a half hand to haul and lift the boxes onto the truck
        himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Right now his whole body felt unbearable, achingly sore – one fight made
        it seem like he had run ten thousand meters.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the boxes were all loaded, the driver told him to ride shotgun,
        but he refused as giving it some thought and climbed into the back.
      </p>

      <p>He could no longer wait to see what his mother had mailed him.</p>

      <p>
        After he left that family, what his mother would mail to him…he felt
        that after having seen what was inside, he could more clearly understand
        what his mother was thinking. 　　
      </p>

      <p>
        The boxes were sealed tightly. He used a knife to cut open the heaviest
        box.
      </p>

      <p>It was a whole box full of books.</p>

      <p>
        The novels and comics he had bought and the magazines he had subscribed
        to were all neatly and tightly packed together. Jiang Cheng scrunched
        his eyebrows as he pulled out a few books from the top layer and looked
        down into the lower layer.
      </p>

      <p>There he saw his high school entrance examination study materials.</p>

      <p>
        He closed the lid over the cardboard box, his mother most likely mailed
        him all the books on his bookshelf without a single one left behind –
        the box below was also packed with books.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t especially love reading books, neither was there a lot of them
        on his bookshelf, but with the addition of his studying materials, it
        was enough to make these two boxes weigh dead-heavy – exactly like his
        current mood.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a moment of hesitation, he also opened the slightly smaller box
        situated beside him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside it was his little gadgets and toys, the things that were
        previously scattered on his desk and inside his drawers, ornaments and
        decorations, interesting small toys, handicrafts, alarm clock, pen
        holders, small framed mirrors, there was even an old, empty lighter.
      </p>

      <p>
        He closed his eyes as his hands harshly scrubbed his face a few times
        before he finally rested it against his forehead to support the weight,
        not wanting to budge again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at his surroundings, his mother most likely didn’t leave behind
        much of his things, probably aside from that piano, the rest were all
        mailed to him peremptorily.
      </p>

      <p>
        For a while now, he was constantly feeling depressed, constrained,
        difficult to understand, and incapable of accepting everything. There
        was hatred and anger, but the moment he saw these things, he felt
        irrevocable sadness.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cold war he was having with his family, getting cursed at by his
        mother and father, being sent back to his birthplace, all had left him
        heartbroken. But seeing these things, mailed back to him without a trace
        of distinguishment or thought toward whether he wanted them by his
        mother as if she was finishing off a mission – this hurt him the most.
      </p>

      <p>
        This sadness hit him stronger than any other feelings he had,
        inescapable and intense.
      </p>

      <p>When the driver stopped the car he almost couldn’t stand up.</p>

      <p>
        Numerous boxes of big and small sizes were emptied off the trucks. As
        the vehicle drove off, Jiang Cheng lightly kicked at the box near his
        feet and sighed.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he leaned against the boxes, Jiang Cheng stared at the snow that had
        been stomped to black muddy mushes by thepassing pedestrians until a
        middle-aged man on a three-wheeled bike passed by collecting waste
        products.
      </p>

      <p>“These two boxes of books,” Jiang Cheng pointed at the box.</p>

      <p>
        The man looked: “The prices we give now for the books are the same as
        paper waste.”
      </p>

      <p>“Sure, take them,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        After the man weighed the books, Jiang Cheng opened the box full of his
        little toys again and took out the only thing he wished to keep: his
        large black slingshot. Then asked: “How ‘bout these?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let me see,” the man roughly rummaged through the box, taking out the
        things inside for a better look. “These are pretty useless things, they
        can’t be traded for much…thirty yuan.”
      </p>

      <p>“Take them,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “The thing in your hand could be worth a bit too,” the man said,
        “Twenty?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “This isn’t for sale,” Jiang Cheng put the slingshot in his pocket,
        thinking how black-hearted the man was, an item worth two hundred when
        purchased, yet only twenty yuan was able to escape his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were two boxes containing his clothes, the man still had an
        interest to collect them: “How ‘bout the clothes?”
      </p>

      <p>“What do you think?” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        The man laughed lightly, took out some cash from his pocket, and handed
        it to him along with a name card. “If you have anything else you want to
        sell, just give me a call ah, I live close, I can get here quick.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sure,” Jiang Cheng stuffed the name card and money together into his
        pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two boxes of clothes felt like two boxes of metal after he moved
        them into the house, they were very heavy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though he wasn’t sure if they were actually heavy, or just that he no
        longer had energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        With two boxes of clothes that could miraculously be kept inside the
        room, he sat down on the edge of his bed and looked at the boxes in
        front of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        These many things were mailed to him using a large amount of money and
        energy, yet in the end they were sold as waste products. Jiang Cheng
        could no longer contain his laughter,
        <em>how smart of a brain, xueba</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took out the handful of dirty, crumpled cash from his pocket and
        though they were all loose change, there seemed to be a lot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Such heavy, such large boxes became only a few tiny pieces of paper.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        Gu Fei sat behind the cash register, playing on his cellphone while
        watching as Li Baoguo took his third turn around the shelves of goods.
        Li Baoguo did not seem to have any goal in mind; he simply turned back
        and forth and would glance over at Gu Fei from time to time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since Li Baoguo had on more than one occasion stolen things in the shop,
        every time he came in, Gu Fei would stare at him directly, but now came
        a Jiang Cheng all of a sudden, though he stared a bit, it wasn’t a
        stare, yet it was.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo was not a thief, sometimes when he gambled all his money away
        and needed to shop, he would first get them on credit; with the majority
        of the people that lived here being those at the lowest rung of society,
        buying and selling things on credit happened quite often than not.
        However, even when Li Baoguo purchased on credit, he would always think
        of a way to steal something else…
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei ah,” Li Baoguo put his hand in a large cotton-padded jacket and
        then took it out, walked to the freezer to grab a bag of fish balls and
        finally made his way to the register. “This, I’ll give you the money in
        two days? Calculate it with the things from last time?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, okay.” Gu Fei took out a notebook from the drawer, looked for the
        page with Li Baoguo’s name and wrote: “A bag of fish balls, a bottle of
        Niu Er liquor<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>, a large…”
      </p>

      <p>“What? I don’t want any liquor,” Li Baoguo said awkwardly.</p>

      <p>
        “The bottle in your pocket,” Gu Fei looked at him. “Li-<em
          >shu<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a></em
        >, you should drink less; you can’t even remember things clearly
        anymore.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh, oh,” Li Baoguo cracked a smile and laughed while slapping his
        pocket. “Yes, I got a bottle… add a pack of changbaishan cigarettes in
        the bag for me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei turned to grab a pack of the ten yuan changbaishan cigarette for
        him then wrote it down.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your handwriting is pretty good,” Li Baoguo moved in closer for a look.
        “Hey, do you know my son?”
      </p>

      <p>“Li Hui, of course, I know him ah,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Not Li Hui, my younger son, Cheng-Cheng.” Li Baoguo propped his elbow
        on the counter, “He just returned. I couldn’t raise him when he was
        younger and gave him away… he’s also at Si Zhong, you must know him.”
      </p>

      <p>“En, I seem to know him,” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo laughed mischievously, “He’s very good in his studies,
        certainly different from Xiao Hui, an excellent student. An excellent
        student, you know that, right? A group of scoundrels like you must all
        be horrible students, huh? My youngest son is indeed a good student.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei smiled, “That’s right.”</p>

      <p>
        “You remember now? I’ll have Cheng-Cheng bring you the money in a couple
        of days.” Li Baoguo looked at the notebook again and then pointed at it
        with his finger, “My son’s handwriting is definitely better than yours.”
      </p>

      <p>“…right,” Gu Fei continued to nod his head.</p>

      <p>
        After Li Baoguo walked out in a good mood, he looked down at his own
        handwriting in the notebook.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t dare to say for certain about other things, but Jiang Cheng’s
        handwriting… it can only be, <em>hehehehehhe</em>, it absolutely
        belonged to the type that had been correctly written, but still had the
        possibility of having marks deducted as the characters were too
        hideously written, which would have undoubtedly irritated the teachers.
      </p>

      <p>
        As noon approached, his mother walked in with a warm lunchbox in hand:
        “I made some red braised pork.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Not going out today?” Gu Fei stood up and turned over the small stool
        to the side: “Did you eat?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Where would I go to ah! Where can I go?!” Her face was packed with
        discontent, “Whoever I got out with will only be left scared or lose
        half their life ah! I don’t want to eat!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wouldn’t it be fine if you looked for someone that doesn’t need a
        beating?” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is there anyone in your eyes that doesn’t need a beating? When are you
        going to be able to see the goodness in people!?” She said resentfully,
        “This is not pleasing for you, that is not pleasing for you, your mom
        living as a widow must be pleasing to you!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “To be able to see the goodness in people, that person must have
        goodness in them.” Gu Fei opened the lid of the lunchbox, took out the
        small box, and pushed half of the braised pork inside.
      </p>

      <p>“Where’s Er Miao?” His mother asked.</p>

      <p>
        “She went out to play. Just save her a bit,” Gu Fei said. “She’ll come
        back to eat when she’s hungry.”
      </p>

      <p>
        His mother sighed: “Being out all day to the point of becoming like
        this, and having that kind of temperament… just looking at her stress me
        out, what’s going to happen later on?”
      </p>

      <p>“Then don’t look,” Gu Fei sat down and began to eat.</p>

      <p>
        “You should go out today,” his mother looked at him and suddenly said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go where?” Gu Fei ate a piece of meat; actually, he knew what she was
        talking about.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Today is what day that you don’t even remember it ah!” She smacked the
        table, “How long has it been since your father died that you don’t
        remember!”
      </p>

      <p>“He died quite a long time ago,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        His mother glared at him without speaking and then after a moment, she
        took out a piece of tissue and started to wipe her tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei had never wanted to understand exactly what kind of feelings his
        mother had for her husband. When he was alive, they had argued every
        day, after the arguments ended, they would fight and once that was done
        with, she would plead to God to have this man die quickly<a
          href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >
        yet now that he was dead, tears would stream at the mention of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes the crying was quite sincere and genuine that it was
        heartbreaking.
      </p>

      <p>“I went to the cemetery two days ago,” Gu Fei said as he ate.</p>

      <p>
        “That’s pointless, I said, going to the cemetery is pointless!” His
        mother looked at him, “Wherever he died, go there! How many times have I
        said that! Otherwise, no one will be at peace! If you don’t want to go,
        I’ll go myself!”
      </p>

      <p>“I’ll go in the afternoon,” Gu Fei sighed.</p>

      <p>
        “Burn some paper offerings,”<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> she continued to
        wipe her tears. “That idiot really knows how to use money, I reckon he’s
        begging for food on the other side.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Stay in the shop this afternoon,” Gu Fei said. “And don’t touch the
        money. If you dare to touch any of it, I’ll tell the King of Hell that
        what I burn is all fake money.”
      </p>

      <p>“…nutcase!” She glared at him.　</p>

      <p>
        The lake that his father died in was quite far away; it was said that a
        small park was to be constructed there yet the land had never been
        touched all this time, mainly because there were no residential areas in
        the vicinity, and the people that went there were only in the handful.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the past two years, even the water was nearly all gone and with no
        one going there, not even the shadow of a person could be seen once
        winter approached.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the lake was as waterless as it was now back then, and if the water
        in the lake was frozen even the slightest more… father would have not
        died.
      </p>

      <p>But.</p>

      <p>
        When he had given Jiang Cheng a summary of Li Baoguo, he was somewhat
        absent-minded… for just a split second, he thought that he was
        introducing his own father to others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes he didn’t dare to think about it – didn’t dare to face his own
        heart that had once so wished he would die, didn’t dare to face his own
        heart that even now thought that if it was to take place again, he would
        still wish for that man to die.
      </p>

      <p>
        His heart and this lake… both were places that he did not want to get
        close to.
      </p>

      <p>
        If his mother didn’t make him go there to burn paper offerings every
        year, he would never be near it.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the house, it was a left turn; after bypassing a small factory, it
        was a continuously straight line with no curves or forks, and when there
        was nowhere else to go, you would arrive.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he bypassed the small factory, there was no one in sight and only
        the ruins and sense of desolation filled his vision – the cold and
        cheerlessness seemed to portray another space.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei lowered his hat, wore his face mask, and then put on earmuffs;
        perhaps, because there were no buildings here, or perhaps because he was
        afraid, he felt cold and that whichever direction the wind appeared
        from, it could easily drill into his body – the chilliness penetrated
        from the outside a layer at a time.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was not much snow this year, but because no one had cleaned it,
        the thick layer that remained on the ground created a sound with each
        step that provoked nervousness in those that trod on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        After walking for a while, he looked down at his feet only to suddenly
        discover a series of footprints on the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        He froze and glanced back and forth at the road, indeed there were two
        lines of footprints – a set coming in and none heading out.
      </p>

      <p>Someone actually escaped to the lakeside in this season.</p>

      <p>He frowned.</p>

      <p>
        Coming to the lake to burn paper offerings was the kind of thing that he
        did not want others to see, he did not want to make others think that he
        harbored any guilt.
      </p>

      <p>He had no guilt, he only had fear – nothing more.</p>

      <p>
        Although the surface of the water was not large, after walking toward
        the lakeside, the wind was still blowing rapidly, raging by until his
        eyes hurt badly.
      </p>

      <p>
        He walked through the sparse woods and stepped on the pile of wild
        grassland to the lakeside, his footprints alldisappeared into the broken
        stubble of ice.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked to the right and left only to see no one, he hesitated for a
        moment and then stared at the lake with many of its areas exposing the
        very bottom of it, there was still no one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, even if someone had previously stepped on the broken ice and
        fell in… the lake as it was now, could notdrown anyone to death, only
        freeze them to death.
      </p>

      <p>
        He found a tree, crouched down against the trunk, threw the bag in his
        hand to the ground and took out a cigarette.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wanted to wait a bit longer, especially since he didn’t want to walk
        along the lakeside anymore, and also, this was a prime location as the
        entrance and exit were unavoidable. His plan was to wait until that
        person left before he started to burn the paper offerings.
      </p>

      <p>
        But after waiting for nearly twenty minutes, without moving, he should
        be frozen yet still no one emerged.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” he hesitantly nipped out his cigarette and picked up the bag.
      </p>

      <p>
        He could only walk a bit further in: one, to see who had passed through
        here, and two, to look for a more hidden spot.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a few hundred metres, Gu Fei heard a crisp sound coming from the
        middle of the lake.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sound was undoubtedly not the type where the ice had cracked
        naturally, it was more like someone had stepped on it or something had
        struck it.
      </p>

      <p>
        He quickly turned and looked toward the middle of the lake, but he did
        not see anyone or anything else – everything was still as can be.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly, he felt his back went cold and turned sharply to look behind
        him.
      </p>

      <p>No one, nothing… something seemed suspicious.</p>

      <p>
        Before he could turn back, a crisp sound came from the lake once more;
        he turned his head sharply again, feeling as though it was going to
        break off.
      </p>

      <p>
        He still didn’t see anything, but the sound this time was much stuffier
        than the previous.
      </p>

      <p>
        Slowly, he drew back a few steps and leaned against a tree; although it
        was a bit naive, he had to actually back into something real for him to
        have a peace of mind.
      </p>

      <p>This time, he stared attentively at the lake.</p>

      <p>
        Just a few seconds later, he caught sight of a stone-like thing flying
        out of the dried-up underbrush, near the lake about a hundred metre from
        where he was, hit the surface of the ice.
      </p>

      <p>
        That echoing sound was not crisped, but rather a dull,
        <em>plop</em>.　　
      </p>

      <p><em>Someone’s throwing stones?</em></p>

      <p><em>That bored?</em></p>

      <p>
        But looking at the speed of the thing flying out, it didn’t seem to be
        thrown by a hand.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei pulled up his clothes, and slowly approached that direction.</p>

      <p>
        Less than twenty metres away, he saw a shadow swaying on a sunken spot
        in front of the lake, and although there was tall withered grass almost
        the height of a person blocking his line of sight, he could still make
        out that it was a person.
      </p>

      <p>Not a ghost.</p>

      <p>
        He was unexpectedly scared until his heart was raced by a person who was
        probably bored enough to throw stones by the lakeside for fun.
      </p>

      <p>Though he felt ridiculous, he was nonetheless, relieved.</p>

      <p>
        He didn’t go any further, but instead, retreated to the woods with the
        intention of waiting for the person to leave and also to see what the
        person was doing.
      </p>

      <p>
        That person hadn’t yet noticed another presence as he bent down
        seemingly to pick up something and then one of his arms stretched
        forward while the other pulled back.
      </p>

      <p>
        A piece of something black flew by, ‘swooshed’, hitting the surface of
        the lake once again.
      </p>

      <p><em>Plop.</em></p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei could immediately see that the person was playing with a
        slingshot, furthermore, he thought that the person’s clothes… were
        familiar-looking.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stared at the person through the space between the withered grass for
        a few more moments and then froze.
      </p>

      <p><em>Jiang Cheng?</em></p>

      <p>
        The clothes on the person were the ones that Jiang Cheng had worn when
        they fought, and on the chest area were two wide grayish-white stripes –
        so freaking hideous.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked around, there was no one else,
        <em>Jiang Cheng actually found this place by himself?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>And then came to play with the slingshot at the iced surface?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >What a sentimental xueba ah… such a great time, yet he’s not home
          studying, and instead, he ran here to play with a slingshot.</em
        ><em>　</em>　
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei lit another cigarette and held it in his mouth as he watched
        Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng must have used small stones, however, now that the riverbank
        had frozen over, finding stones was not easy and every time he stooped
        down, he had to dig around for quite a while; sometimes he even used his
        feet to kick it a few times.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei watched for a moment and felt that Jiang Cheng appeared to not be
        in a good mood again. Several times, when he used his feet to kick, his
        action was just as if he wanted to fight – the hidden anger could
        obviously be seen.
      </p>

      <p>
        But after seeing him slingshot four or five stones, Gu Fei was once
        again surprised.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took out his glasses from the inner pocket of his jacket and put it
        on, and just stared and looked on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was aiming at the same spot that was roughly 30 metres away
        from the shore; surprisingly, he had actually struck the target every
        single time, causing an ice hole to form there.
      </p>

      <p><em>Pretty awesome.</em></p>

      <p>
        There were plenty of people who played with slingshots, and among the
        people that Gu Fei knew, there were also many who bragged about how
        awesomely accurate they were – many having claimed they could hit a
        target 70 metres away.
      </p>

      <p>
        But for the first time, he saw for himself that someone could indeed
        sling a stone continuously into the same hole more than a dozen times in
        a row.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng played for a while and then stopped before he stooped to dig
        and kick again, yet after some time, he still didn’t straighten back up,
        possibly unable to find any more stones.
      </p>

      <p>
        After making a few laps in the same location, he walked in Gu Fei’s
        direction causing Gu Fei to quickly move back and squatted behind a
        tree.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Jiang Cheng could not find any stones for what seemed like half
        the day, and shouted unhappily; his voice was pretty loud, and as it
        flowed along the wind, Gu Fei could hear it quite clearly.
      </p>

      <p><em>There are no more stones, you should just leave.</em></p>

      <p>
        But Jiang Cheng didn’t leave, he looked down at the ground, kicked a few
        times, and found a small stone after kicking a piece of frozen snow.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei sighed. 　</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng placed a few pieces into the pocket of his jacket, looked
        toward the lake and then turned around.
      </p>

      <p>
        After steadying his hold for a few seconds, he turned around and raised
        his hand, slinging out a stone.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Bam, </em>the sound of the stone hitting somewhere in the distance
        exposed a thin steel bar on the ground.
      </p>

      <p><em>Shit.</em></p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was shocked; had he not worn his glasses, he would not have been
        able to see where the steel bar was.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng turned around and took a few steps to the side before he
        once again swung his body around. The stone that flew out struck the
        steel bar again, tearing through it to pieces.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh yeah! That one too!” Jiang Cheng clapped, then raised his slingshot,
        waved in all directions and bowed a few times: “Thank you, thank you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei held back his laughter, and slowly retreated for a good distance
        – if Jiang Cheng was to discover that he was here, it was expected that
        the two of them would flatten the field of trees.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The contestant, Jiang Cheng, has decided to raise the difficulty level
        once more! He has decided to raise the difficulty level once more!
        Wow—”Jiang Cheng said enthusiastically while drawing two stones from his
        pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time, instead of turning his back to the steel bar, he aimed ahead
        and pulled his hand.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei practically heard two sounds simultaneously.</p>

      <p><em>Ding.</em></p>

      <p><em>Plop.</em></p>

      <p>
        Of the two stones that he had slingshotted together, one hit the
        intended target, the other missed and hit the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Aiya, what a pity.” Jiang Cheng fished out another stone out of his
        pocket while saying, “Coach X, do you think he made a mistake this time
        or his skills are not up to par?”
      </p>

      <p><em>Coach X?</em></p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei finally reacted after some time,
        <em>what the hell is Coach X?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        “I think there’s still room for improvement in his skill,” Jiang Cheng
        slingshotted again. “It seems he wants to change the pattern of the
        challenge…will he decrease the difficulty or continue…”
      </p>

      <p>
        His hand loosened, a stone flew out, and without waiting for Gu Fei to
        see clearly, he followed with another pull; the second stone also flew
        out, immediately followed by the third.
      </p>

      <p><em>Ding, ding, ding.</em></p>

      <p>All three struck.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at his back, if it wasn’t for this current scenario, he
        would have truthfully given Jiang Cheng an applause – not only for his
        aim, but his movements were pretty much ridden with ease and confidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Li Yan was here, after watching the silent version of this scene, he
        would certainly no longer say,<em>
          ‘he doesn’t fit in right with me’. </em
        ><em>　</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        However, after such an excellent performance, Jiang Cheng unexpectedly
        did not applaud himself or wave his hand and bowed – he simply stood
        still without uttering a word.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a while, he lowered his head and slowly crouched down, holding his
        head in both of his hands.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei froze.</p>

      <p><em>That engrossed in his performance…?</em></p>

      <p>
        But soon he saw Jiang Cheng’s shoulder lightly twitched a few times.
      </p>

      <p>This was crying.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei smoked the last two puffs from the cigarette before he snubbed it
        out beneath his feet, got up and continued to walk ahead.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had no interest in watching this kind of scene. It was okay to watch
        an entertaining matter, but peeping at the injuries of others, and
        watching someone that always seemed to explode, cry – was meaningless.
      </p>

      <p>
        This lake had an end though you couldn’t go around it and ahead was a
        mountain that resembled a rotten sweet potato, making it impossible to
        cross over.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei found a small piece of land with no grass and spent about ten
        minutes until he was able to start a fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then he took out the bundle of paper money out of the bag and threw it
        into the fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were gold and yellow ones, and also flowers; the face value ranged
        from nothing to several hundred billion – everything that should be
        there was there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at the rising flames and stretched his hands over them.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this kind of moment, he should probably say something; others would
        generally say as ‘take the money ah, we’re all doing pretty well so
        don’t be concerned ah, if you don’t have enough money just say it, don’t
        worry ah’… if he wanted to speak, he truly did not know what he could
        say.
      </p>

      <p>
        He watched as the flames silently changed color, rising in the thick
        smoke, rippling like a wave in the wind, then getting a little smaller,
        and finally, only a bluish-black smoke remained.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei grabbed a twig and lightly flicked it to the side rousing the
        black fragments of paper, still embraced with sparks to float
        delicately, then everything resumed its tranquil state.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stood up, kicked the loose snow from the side over to cover the black
        ash before he turned to leave.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every year, after this day, Gu Fei felt less suffocated – relaxed
        really. The days returned back to that of senselessness, consisting of
        watching the shop, watching Gu Miao like a rabbit scuttling the entire
        streets, going to school to attend boring classes, playing the retarded
        Craz3 Match game, and watching Lao Xu’s futile attempts to rescue him
        from his so-called darkness.
      </p>

      <p>
        That day, Jiang Cheng did not cry that long by the lake; by the time he
        had finished burning the paper, and turned his head, Jiang Cheng was no
        longer there.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, when Gu Fei bumped into him at school, he couldn’t make out
        anything abnormal – he was still dragging a thorny demeanor with a sting
        to his words; in class he still rested his body on the desk as usual or
        closed his eyes while still listening, and occasionally squinted to take
        down notes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two did not interfere with each other in class and had nothing to
        say.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though, every time Gu Fei recalled his performance at the lake, he was
        always worried he would laugh out loud.
      </p>

      <p>“Da Fei,” Zhou Jing leaned on his desk, “Da Fei? Da…”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng impatiently picked up the book in his hand and smacked him
        in the head and controlled his voice: “If you have something to say,
        just fucking say it directly! Have you really never been beaten badly by
        anyone because of this before!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Zhou Jing clutched his own head and glared at him, then looked
        at Gu Fei. “Da Fei, when I went to Xu Zong’s office earlier today, I
        heard him say something like the school wants to hold a spring
        basketball competition next month.”
      </p>

      <p>“I don’t know,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “You’re joining, right? Our class is counting on you, if you don’t join,
        we’ll definitely lose,” Zhou Jing said.
      </p>

      <p>“Don’t bother me,” Gu Fei pointed at him.</p>

      <p>Zhou Jing turned around and rested on his own desk. 　　</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s mind suddenly began to wander,
        <em>next month? Spring basketball competition?</em>
      </p>

      <p><em>March is considered spring?</em></p>

      <p>
        Thinking ofthe basketball competition, he suddenly felt a bit contrite.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recalling his past memories of playing basketball in school would evoke
        some other unpleasantness, and yet it was unstoppable – memories of
        those delightful moments running freely on the court.
      </p>

      <p>Compared to the present, those memories were all bright.</p>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p data-adtags-visited="true"></p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng crouched in his room trying to assemble a small bookshelf,
        but even after he fussed with it until his whole body was covered with
        sweat, the shelf was still not complete.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Out of all the times that he had given his money to Daddy – Jack Ma<a
          href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >, this was probably the time where it was most well-spent.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        For such a small bookshelf that was over five hundred yuan and dead
        heavy, the high-end texture signified that it was indeed on a whole
        other level with each piece that passed through his hand. The problem
        was that there were quite a few pieces, plus the fact that it had an
        irregularly shaped frame, and none of the pieces were identical.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng stared at the instruction manual for a long time before
        finally piecing together the legs and the board underneath; screws also
        had to be added and the holes were tiny, making it difficult to screw
        in, hence, he had to hammer it in with… a hammer.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “You bought this thing online?” Li Baoguo pushed open the door, his
        voice ringing all too loudly as usual.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        From a young age to now, once the door to his room was closed, no one
        would enter from simply a push on the door. Once Li Baoguo’s yell rang
        out, Jiang Cheng felt as if his heart was going to jump out from his
        mouth and stick against the wall.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The hammer in his hand immediately clattered – <em>clang</em> – and
        landed against the thumb of his left hand.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        He gritted his teeth and endured the radiating pain that eventuated from
        his fingertips a second later.　
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “It’s a bookshelf, right?” Li Baoguo asked again.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Yes,” Jiang Cheng managed to let the word escape from his gritted
        teeth.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “How much was it?” Li Baoguo walked in and bent his back to look at the
        scattered pieces of boards lying on the ground. “And you even have to
        set it together yourself?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Yes,” Jiang Cheng sucked in some air, finally feeling he had overcome a
        bit of the pain. He watched Li Baoguo, “Can you knock the door first the
        next time you come in?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Knock the door?” Li Baoguo was awestruck, then started to laugh as if
        Jiang Cheng had said something absurdly hilarious. After laughing for
        quite a while, he finally laid a hand on his shoulder, “Knock what door!
        My son’s room, I need to knock on my own son’s door before I enter his
        room? I ejaculated your whole being!”
      </p>

      <p>“Wh… at?” Jiang Cheng was severely startled.</p>

      <p>
        “Just kidding!” Li Baoguo continued to laugh loudly, pointing at him,
        “You silly boy, even this scares you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No,” Jiang Cheng stared at the boards lying on the floor. Not to
        mention continuing with the assemblage, he didn’t even feel like lifting
        his eyelids at the moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let me tell you, this household doesn’t have that many rules, a room
        full of rough folks can’t fake the demeanours the rich people put up,”
        Li Baoguo said. “Look at you, can’t even put up a bookshelf… not that it
        matters, your studies are good. Kids who are good at studying just
        aren’t good at things like this, you only have time to nurture your
        brain.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng listened to the speech that had no particular logic; all he
        could do was to remain silent – an attempt on using silence to repel Li
        Baoguo in hopes that he would leave once he had said enough.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Li Baoguo was not beaten back – he squatted down by Jiang Chang’s
        side and said: “Let me have a look.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng didn’t budge, he simply took over the board for a
        closer look and then examined the finished product on the instruction
        manual. “Okay, just move to the side and I’ll handle it.”
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Jiang Cheng twisted his head to look at him.</p>

      <p>
        “This is easy,” Li Baoguo picked through the pile of boards, took out
        two pieces, then grabbed a twisted wooden beam and started to assemble.
        “Let me tell you, this is just a waste of money. I could have just
        picked up a few boards at a construction site and made this sort of
        thing for you in two hours.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng watched his dexterous hands work soundlessly – at this
        moment, Li Baoguo looked a lot more pleasing to the eye then he normally
        did at the gambling table when his eyes were fixed on the cards. 　　
      </p>

      <p>
        In less than half an hour, Li Baoguo had already finished assembling the
        bookshelf, and he hadn’t even taken a single glance at the instruction
        manual.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay,” he clapped his hands, looking at the shelf. “This thing sure is
        ugly, you buying this… how much did you spend?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… three hundred,” Jiang Cheng originally wanted to say four hundred,
        but subtracted a bit after some hesitation.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Three hundred?” Li Baoguo bellowed in surprise. “This sort of wooden
        structure cost three hundred? You good-for-nothing boy, spending so
        recklessly ah!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not reply, he honestly was not sure if saying two
        hundred or saying one hundred would make Li Baoguo scream like this
        also.
      </p>

      <p>
        This shelf was certainly not cheap, but one, the quality was pretty
        good, and two, it was a style that he liked. In a room that he did not
        belong to before nor would he find a sense of belonging in the future,
        he needed “something of his own”, only then would he feel at ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this was something Li Baoguo would not understand nor was he able to
        make Li Baoguo understand.
      </p>

      <p>
        “My son sure has the tycoon swag,” Li Baoguo sighed, “This father of
        yours still has to live on credit from buying the smallest things.”
      </p>

      <p>“What’d you put on credit this time?” Jiang Cheng stared blankly.</p>

      <p>
        “Remember the fish cakes I bought the other day, the ones that you said
        tasted quite good,” Li Baoguo said. “And that bottle of… ai, that kid’s
        eyes are simply too sharp, otherwise, I wouldn’t have to pay for that
        alcohol… but there are other things on credit from before, this bit of
        money is nothing.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at him, feeling as if his own eyeballs were about to
        roll out, he kept on wanting to cup his hands and catch them.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How ‘bout…” Li Baoguo looked at him with an expression full of
        awkwardness and embarrassment, “Son, do you have some money… on hand?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng really wanted to answer no, but it was undeniable that
        during the half an hour in which Li Baoguo helped him put up the
        bookshelf, he fell in a trance, even feeling somewhat touched.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although he felt now that the true motives behind Li Baoguo’s voluntary
        actions to help him assemble the shelf may just be an exchange for Jiang
        Cheng to pay his debt… he still nodded his head: “I do.”
      </p>

      <p>“My son sure is reliable!” Li Baoguo slapped him on the elbow.</p>

      <p>
        “Which store did you put them on credit?” Jiang Cheng asked. “How much
        in total? I’ll go pay it back now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just that small shop on the street next to us… you should know it, Gu
        Fei,” Li Baoguo replied. “The store that Da Fei’s family owns…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What did you say? Gu Fei?” Jiang Cheng did not wait for him to finish
        before interrupting him – his voice almost cracking when he spoke.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah, he seems to know you too,” Li Baoguo said. “Just say that I told
        you to go… hey, he also goes to Si Zhong, you must know that, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not reply; amidst a moment of disbelief and chaos as
        well as an underlying and inexplicable embarrassment, he grabbed his
        jacket and walked out the door.
      </p>

      <p><em>That’s just too fucking much… of an embarrassment!</em></p>

      <p>
        His own father! Had debts in the shop of a deskmate that he had just
        fought with not too long ago!
      </p>

      <p>
        Being in debt was actually no big deal since Li Baoguo’s way of life was
        after all perceivable, but from the sound of it, he owed debt while
        stealing things!
      </p>

      <p>And he was caught by Gu Fei!</p>

      <p><em>Fuck!</em></p>

      <p><em>Fuck, fuck!</em></p>

      <p><em>A chain of fucks…</em></p>

      <p>Why was he returning the money himself?</p>

      <p>
        Wasn’t it the same if he handed the money to Li Baoguo for him to
        return?
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Yes, why go there only to receive the embarrassment
          first-handedly</em
        >, Jiang Cheng turned around and headed back.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he arrived at the head of the hallway, he heard Li Baoguo’s
        voice echoing, seemingly chatting with the upstairs neighbor: “My
        youngest son is a promising kid! Once he heard that I had unsettled
        accounts at the store, he immediately went to pay up!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ya,” the neighbourhood aunt said, “Then you’re quite blessed,
        effortlessly picking up a son like this.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How is it called ‘effortlessly’! It’s also my seed ah!” Li Baoguo very
        joyfully replied in a loud voice, “This kid is better than Li Hui, he
        couldn’t even bear to have me run down to the shop!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Look at your face full of smiles,” the aunt said. “You should live
        properly then, drinking like that every day, wait ‘til this son of yours
        also starts to ignore you!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Pei</em>!<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> In this whole building you’re the
        only one who doesn’t know how to talk properly, asking you to talk
        nicely is like asking you to drop dead on the ground!” Li Baoguo shot
        back.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then what are you showing off to me for – for you to not show off is
        also like asking you to drop dead!” The aunt started to scream.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t stay to hear the ending of that conversation. He
        finally knew how these daily fights between neighbors started – just
        based on the structure of that conversation alone, a fight was bound to
        erupt in minutes.
      </p>

      <p>
        He glumly leaned against the outer wall to the stairwell, pulled off his
        hat in annoyance, and scratched his hair.
      </p>

      <p>
        After five minutes of fighting an inner battle, he gritted his teeth and
        once again headed toward the street on which the Gu family shop resided
        – mainly because it was so cold that his face was already numb after his
        battle.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was really no big deal actually, he was just going to pay back some
        money, not to create more debt, also not to steal things…
      </p>

      <p>If he was happy later on, he might even add interest!</p>

      <p>
        Walking through the fork road, the door to Gu Fei’s family shop was
        practically facing the intersection directly, hence, standing at the
        intersection, he could immediately see Gu Fei standing at the doorway
        while chewing on a cigarette and playing on his phone with his head
        lowered.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was likely that because he had never done something so embarrassing,
        Jiang Cheng’s zealous thought of “adding interest if he was in the mood”
        instantly disappeared as if it was running for its life the moment he
        saw Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        And by the time Gu Fei raised his head and noticed him, Jiang Cheng felt
        as though his arms and legs were out of coherence as he walked.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >So fucking embarrassing, how could Li Baoguo live in such a shameful
          manner…</em
        >　　
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei watched him walk over without much expression on his face, and
        only when Jiang Cheng crossed the street and walked toward him did he
        take the cigarette out from his mouth and asked: “Coming to buy pots
        again?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… talk inside,” Jiang Cheng saw a staff walk out from the pharmacy next
        door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei turned into the store with Jiang Cheng following him from behind.
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Gu Fei turned around to look at him.</p>

      <p>“Li Baoguo left debts here <em>ba</em>?” he asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei nodded, leaning against the cash register. “Though, not
        much really, I don’t have anything too expensive here anyway.”
      </p>

      <p>“How much,” Jiang Cheng took out his wallet. “I’ll give it to you.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei glanced at him as he reached his hand back toward the ashtray to
        extinguish the cigarette. He pulled open a drawer, took out a notebook
        and flipped through the pages, all the while asking: “Your own money?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What else would it be,” Jiang Cheng said. “He probably wouldn’t use
        credit if he had money.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “If he didn’t gamble, he wouldn’t need to buy on credit,” Gu Fei handed
        him the notebook. “Two hundred sixty-eight, have a look.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No need,” Jiang Cheng didn’t reach for the notebook, he
        straightforwardly handed three hundred yuan to Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t want to witness it at all, this type of life that Li Baoguo
        lived… no, and his gambling friends, they were actually people who could
        live this sort of life with no foreseeable end.
      </p>

      <p>
        “He leaves debts every month,” Gu Fei flipped through the drawer for
        change, and with a hand on the table surface, he looked at Jiang Cheng.
        “Are you gonna pay for him next month too?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked back at him and stuffed the cash back into his wallet
        in annoyance: “How the fuck is it your business.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What I mean is that you should let him pay it himself,” Gu Fei
        continued. “He basically has enough to pay them all.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at him, <em>can pay them all?</em> But based on Li
        Baoguo’s speech earlier, he meant that he couldn’t pay them.
      </p>

      <p>
        “But if there is someone willing to pay for him, of course, he doesn’t
        have to waste energy on this,” Gu Fei sat down on the chair. “You can’t
        even see through this game of his?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… no, my eyesight isn’t good,” Jiang Cheng sighed. “It’s not like I
        wear glasses to show off.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Those are my nearsighted-glasses,” Gu Fei swept his gaze across his
        face.　
      </p>

      <p>
        “Became nearsighted from playing that retarded Craz3 Match, right?”
        Jiang Cheng answered with a question.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the,” Gu Fei laughed. “Where were you living before, the attitude
        of the people there is quite <em>peachy</em>, huh?”　
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looked back at him without a word.</p>

      <p>
        “Just this sour attitude of yours, if you weren’t my deskmate, no, if Er
        Miao didn’t intake the wrong medications and see you pleasing to the
        eye,” Gu Fei pointed at him. “I would have smacked you so hard a long
        time ago to the point that Xiao Ming’s grandfather wouldn’t have been
        able to recognize you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You?” Jiang Cheng laughed coldly. “How would you smack me, pinch my
        palm?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s true, I’m not as capable as you,” Gu Fei pushed his sleeves up,
        and showed Jiang Cheng his wrist.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng glanced over and saw a shallow red mark.</p>

      <p>
        “Oh fuck,” he was quite surprised. “It’s still not gone after having
        been bitten so long ago?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your teeth are quite remarkable, if I knew you had the ability to bite
        off a zipper, I would’ve stayed clear,” Gu Fei said. “Your bite left a
        chain of bloody holes, and the scab only just fell off.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t respond – he honestly never thought that such a
        careless bite from the other day could leave such a mark on Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>But if Gu Fei didn’t pinch his wound…</p>

      <p>
        He suddenly really wanted to laugh – he had actually fought such a
        stupid fight with Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        He tried to contain his laughter while glancing at Gu Fei, however, even
        Gu Fei’s expressions were obviously also contained; the corner of his
        mouth wasn’t even stretched tight enough as it was already arching
        upwards.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” he said.And simultaneously, he and Gu Fei, broke out in
        hysterical laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Foolish laughter was a contagious illness, the less you wanted to laugh,
        the more severe your laughter became, and it was unstoppable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before, when Pan Zhi was scolded by their homeroom teacher, he would say
        that his heart was convulsed with fear, yet for some reason, he just
        couldn’t stop laughing. In the end, when he was kicked out into the
        hallway, he always laughing deeply with his head thrown in the air –
        very carefree.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t want to laugh at this exact moment either seeing as
        he wasn’t in too good of a mood and his sentiments were low… neither did
        he want to be laughing with Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>But he just couldn’t stop.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei leaned against the chair, Jiang Cheng leaned against the storage
        rack, and their laughter lasted for almost a solid minute. In the end,
        his anger roused from his feet due to the uncontrollable laughter; he
        lifted up the curtains and walked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” As the cold winter wind blew into his face, he finally stopped
        his crazy laughter and swore out loud.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t turn to go back into the store after swearing, and instead,
        simply walked down the road toward the intersection with his hand in his
        pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was quite depressing – this sort of hysterical laughter could only
        last so long, once the sound of laughter stopped, he immediately
        returned back to reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        He suddenly became a bit flustered. If he continued to suppress himself
        like this, would he end up catching onto some illness….
      </p>

      <p>　</p>

      <p>
        When Zhou Jing mentioned the spring basketball competition, the
        information was quite accurate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu called Jiang Cheng into his office, and the second he saw the
        basketball on Lao Xu’s desk, he immediately knew what Lao Xu had called
        him over for.
      </p>

      <p>“I don’t know how to play basketball,” he said.</p>

      <p>
        “Ah, this kid,” Lao Xu brought over a stool. “Sit down, let’s chat.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sat down. To tell the truth, he wanted to play ball, but
        only to find a few people and have a go at someleisure game. He didn’t
        want to be formally called down by Lao Xu only to be informed in such a
        formal way that he had to carry such responsibilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You used to be on the school’s basketball team, right?” Lao Xu asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How about we stop with these fake useless questions, Lao Xu,” Jiang
        Cheng sighed. “I feel like you’d already looked into eight generations
        of my ancestry.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “An all-rounded xueba finally comes to our school, of course I’d have to
        study you,” Lao Xu started to laugh. “Actually, before I called you
        over, I kind of knew you’d reject it, but I still wanted to give it a
        try.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng responded.</p>

      <p>
        “Our school hosts basketball competitions every year, not just once and
        also, the principal likes to play basketball,” Lao Xu continued.
        “Regardless, I’ve always led our class, but no matter what sort of
        tournament or contest, we’ve never won even once…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was quite surprised, he had seen Gu Fei play ball, so even
        if no one in the class was able to cooperate with him, it was still
        unlikely that they hadn’t won even once.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Isn’t Gu Fei quite good at playing?” he couldn’t stop himself from
        letting out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That kid,” Lao Xu sighed. “Is really unreliable, he never attends any
        class-related activities, it’s already good enough that he doesn’t help
        the other classes play against us.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then, what did you call me over for? It’s unlikely that I can win a
        game by myself,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How ‘bout you be the team captain,” Lao Xu said. “I feel like you have
        the abilities to…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Where’d you feel that from ah?” Jiang Cheng was starting to feel pretty
        helpless.
      </p>

      <p>“From your soul,” Lao Xu replied.</p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai-yo</em>,” Jiang Cheng couldn’t refrain from rubbing the area
        over his heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you agree,” Lao Xu smiled. “I’ll go and talk to Gu Fei, you two,
        plus Wang Xu, Guo Xu, Lu Xiaobin… at least gather together five people,
        and then find some time to practice every day, I feel like we have a
        chance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t answer – he didn’t even know who Guo Xu and Lu
        Xiaobin were.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet Lao Xu continued to persuade him in a very honest manner, and Jiang
        Cheng could find no reason to reject him at the moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Xu Zong, I only have one request,” he said. “I’m definitely not going
        to be captain, my soul probably caused you to misunderstand that. Change
        it to another person, and it’ll all be the same if I just play along.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Once Jiang Cheng agreed, it was as if Lao Xu got high on chicken blood<a
          href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >
        – he immediately called over Gu Fei during the self-study period.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei, come to my office for a second,” Lao Xu knocked on his desk.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I haven’t been late or skipped class for a while now,” Gu Fei said, his
        forehead resting on the edge of the table as he played his retarded
        Craz3 Match game.
      </p>

      <p>“It’s not about that,” Lao Xu knocked on the desk again.</p>

      <p>“I don’t play basketball,” Gu Fei continued.</p>

      <p>“Not about this either,” Lao Xu said. “Come on.”</p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu turned around and walked out of the classroom, Gu Fei persisted
        and finished this round before he finally stood up unwillingly and
        slowly swayed out of the classroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey Jiang Cheng, Jiang…” Zhou Jing seemed to have remembered something
        after calling out twice and didn’t continue to call. “Lao Xu called you
        two to talk about the competition, right?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng made no sound.</p>

      <p>
        “Ai, one look and I knew you definitely knew how to play ball, right,
        you know how to play basketball right?” Zhou Jing continued to ask.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your class never won a single game during the competition?” Jiang Cheng
        asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah, never won,” Zhou Jing replied. “We’re a humanities class right,
        it’s normal for us to not win.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng eyed him: “Fucking nonsense.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei returned to the classroom ten minutes later, and once he sat
        down, he pulled out his phone and continued to play his game.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng thought he would say something, yet in the end he didn’t
        utter a word – looked like Lao Xu failed.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked toward where Wang Xu sat, if Gu Fei wasn’t there, and he had
        to play with a dumbass like Wang Xu… it was quite boring when you
        thought about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who would’ve thought such a tender old uncle like Lao Xu would learn to
        lie one day,” Gu Fei uttered in a small voice.
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Jiang Cheng turned his head around. “Lie to you about what?”</p>

      <p>
        “He even said it wasn’t about playing basketball,” Gu Fei said as he
        continued to play. “He said that you’re going to play, is that true?”
      </p>

      <p>“… en,” Jiang Cheng responded. “He sounded really pitiful.”</p>

      <p>“Everyone looks pitiful to you,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“En, you look pretty pitiful to me too,” Jiang Cheng glared at him.</p>

      <p>“Pity me that I play Craz3 Match?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Pity you play Craz3 Match and haven’t been able to get through a single
        level in four days,” Jiang Cheng caught on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei put down his phone and turned around to look at him: “I find that
        you’re really looking for a beating<sup>109</sup> <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng piled on a face full of fake smiles and turned to face him:
        “You can shut your mouth if you can’t outspeak me, it’s not like
        bickering back and forth is any fun.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What position did you play before?” Gu Fei lowered his head and
        nonchalantly continued on with his game.
      </p>

      <p>“Defense,” Jiang Cheng replied in reflex.</p>

      <p>
        “Then let’s give it a try,” Gu Fei said. “I didn’t answer Lao Xu
        definitely.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No, like,” Jiang Cheng thought that this was somewhat out of the blue.
        “Isn’t it just to play a game, it’s not like you were asked to be
        executed for sacrificial purposes, is it that difficult?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s annoying,” Gu Fei stated. “Just think about it, a guy like Jiuri<a
          href="#_ftn4"
          >[4]</a
        >
        is gonna be on the court too.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s wrong with him going on court,” Jiang Cheng looked over at his
        classmate, Wang Jiuri, he was currently leaning back with his arms
        folded, acting like a boss with his eyes closed – resting his spirit.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Every class has this sort of person… fuck!” Gu Fei threw his phone into
        the opening on his desk, probably from failing this level again. “Fine
        on the court, yet who knows what goes on off the court, I’m annoyed with
        that.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you playing or not?” Jiang Cheng asked. “I’m annoyed too, give it a
        fucking<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> try, fuck <em>ah</em> – either play, or
        don’t fucking play at all.”
      </p>

      <p>“Sure,” Gu Fei said. “I’ll play if you play.”</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The second Gu Fei agreed to play in this basketball competition, Jiang
        Cheng could perceive that the degree of Lao Xu’s excitement was no less
        than as if Gu Fei had passed the entrance examination into Beijing
        University.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
      </p>

      <span id="more-5778"></span>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        After the class was dismissed in the afternoon, he called the five team
        members that he had hand-picked to his office.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng gave them a glance, finally, he could fit the names to their
        faces for Guo Xu and Lu Xiaobin.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “No subs?<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>” Wang Xu asked, “Only the five of us
        playing the entire time?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Just see for yourselves if there are any suitable substitute players
        among your classmates,” Lao Xu said. “The team’s captain is…”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        When Lao Xu uttered those words, his eyes subconsciously flitted over to
        Gu Fei, however, Gu Fei put his thumbs down nonchalantly and then
        pointed at Wang Xu: “Him.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Wang Xu promptly looked up, a face flaring with reluctance: “Yah, I’m no
        good… I don’t want to be the captain, so annoying, ugh.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng wanted to laugh from just looking at his appearance,
        <em>your acting is really shitty.</em>
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Then Wang Xu it is, you guys can start practicing tomorrow.” Lao Xu
        took the basketball off the table and passed it over to Wang Xu, “This
        is a good ball. I went to look in the equipment room of our gymnasium
        earlier, and all the balls there were pretty bad so I bought this one
        for you – a new and good ball will definitely be used in the game as
        well; we have to also use a suitable one for practice.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Thank you, Xu Zong.” Guo Xu took the ball from Wang Xu’s hand and
        bounced it on the ground twice.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng observed his movements, <em>not bad</em>, although he felt
        that it was not that impressive, he could play, at the very least.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Wang Xu looked quite smug, he should also be able to play and perhaps
        thought he could play pretty well. The other person, Lu Xiaobin, hadn’t
        spoken a word the entire time. He was the tallest, about 190cm with a
        visual assessment and he was quite robust, just like a wooden plank door
        – <em>pretty good.</em>
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Substitute players were easy to find. Though this was a humanities
        class, there were many male students, and Captain Wang Jiuri needed only
        to call the few 180cm’s in the back row – complete.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many people wanted to participate, after all, they did not need to
        attend the self-study class, and could go and play ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu had helped them reserve a court already; just by seeing his
        energetic air, Jiang Cheng was honestly tired for him: a chaotic class
        in a rotten school, grades that wouldn’t increase and a physical
        education system with this moral integrity, however, the point was that
        even with all those, Lao Xu was still brimming with enthusiasm.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll take a look at all your levels first.” Wang Xu held the ball with
        the swag of a captain as he stood in the middle of the basketball court.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How many times over have we played together,” someone said. “What
        levels are there still left to see huh?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “We must know each other well!” Wang Xu pulled a long face, repeatedly
        looking at Jiang Cheng who was crouching to the side of the court.
        “Jiang Cheng, how about you give it a try first since you just
        transferred here, I’m not too clear about your actual level.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng stood up and took off his jacket. “What do you want
        done?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Get the ball past me,” Wang Xu threw the ball over and then arranged
        himself in an interception stance.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay,” Jiang Cheng caught the ball, bounced it twice to get a feel of
        the ball’s elasticity before he dribbled the ball head- on toward Wang
        Xu.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu stood at the same spot without moving; by the time he reached
        out to block him, Jiang Cheng had already flown by his left side and
        made a three-step layup<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> – scoring beautifully.
      </p>

      <p>“Not bad!” Guo Xu shouted.</p>

      <p>
        “Hold on!” Wang Xu looked a bit displeased, “I didn’t say ‘start’ yet,
        you sneak attacked.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng took the ball and returned to standing in front of
        him.
      </p>

      <p>Wang Xu once again put on his posture and lifted his chin: “Come!”</p>

      <p>
        As soon as Jiang Cheng moved, he rushed over and waved his arms to not
        only block him but also attempt to snatch the ball. Jiang Cheng
        hesitated though then he directly took a jump shot<a href="#_ftn5"
          >[5]</a
        >
        for the basket – scored again.
      </p>

      <p>“Three points,” Gu Fei said while sitting on a stool to the side.</p>

      <p>
        “Awesome! There is hope for our class this time!” Someone shouted
        excitedly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The expression on Wang Xu’s face was a bit unsightly, and just as he was
        about to speak, Gu Fei interrupted him: “Just hurry up<a href="#_ftn6"
          >[6]</a
        >, it’s cold.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The central heating system in the gymnasium was no good; now with
        everyone having had taken off their jackets, leaving just their shirts
        on, Wang Xu could only nod: “How about this, let’s split into two teams
        and try for a half-time<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> to get a sense of
        things?”
      </p>

      <p>Everyone expressed their agreement.</p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu, who had been watching from the sideline, came over at this exact
        moment: “Have Gu Fei and Jiang Cheng on either side.”
      </p>

      <p>“Why?” Wang Xu asked, “The two are great, let them cooperate.”</p>

      <p>
        “It’s not difficult for them to cooperate but the point is that if
        they’re together, there is literally no need for us to play ah,” Lu
        Xiaobin said. “With both of them split into either team, everyone can
        practice.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright, geez.” Wang Xu did not put on a captain’s attitude this time
        as he split the members evenly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lu Xiaobin, Guo Xu, and two others that Jiang Cheng did not know; on
        Jiang Cheng’s side were himself, Wang Xu and three others that he also
        did not know.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was then that Jiang Cheng finally understood how bad his recent
        emotional state was – such a long time had passed, yet he did not
        recognize any of those people, at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        With ten people on the court and five of which he did not recognize, he
        relied solely on their clothes, and it didn’t help much that he had just
        distinguished two of them today….<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu grabbed a whistle and walked to stand at the sideline: “I’ll be
        the referee then.”
      </p>

      <p>“What’s there to referee in a half-time game,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “A half-time game also needs to abide by the rules,” Lao Xu had one hand
        on his hip and the other holding the whistle. “From the start of the
        ‘jump ball’<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>, it’s a very brief moment,
        everything else will work accordingly.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay,” Wang Xu called the people on his side together. “Man-to-man
        defense<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>, and also keep an eye especially on Da
        Fei. If you have the ball, give it to Jiang Cheng, don’t hold onto it
        yourself. Once Da Fei approaches, pass the ball immediately, he’s
        fucking great at steals<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay,” several people nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “Scoring points will depend on you.” Wang Xu raised his hand, intending
        to pat Jiang Cheng on the shoulder, but just as it was about to land, he
        pulled back. “I forgot that you have a problem with not being patted.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng sighed.</p>

      <p>
        The jump ball was not unexpected at all – Jiang Cheng and Gu Fei were to
        jump for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu stretched his hand out, placing the ball between the two of them:
        “Focus your attention, I’m going to throw the ball now.”
      </p>

      <p>“Which referee would even say this…” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“Pay attention!” Lao Xu gave him a glare.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at Wang Xu who stood behind him, wondering how this
        kid would react.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had always played defense, never having jumped for the ball in a
        formal game – in truth, this ball was estimated to be taken by Gu Fei’s
        side of the team.
      </p>

      <p>Lao Xu tossed the ball up.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at it, calculating where it would land before he
        jumped.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he jumped, he honestly felt that he had a good grasp of the timing
        of his takeoff, but when he reached out to touch the ball, Gu Fei’s hand
        was already on it.
      </p>

      <p>Of course.</p>

      <p>
        By the time Jiang Cheng landed on his feet and turned around, the ball
        had already been received by Guo Xu who was swiftly dashing toward the
        basket.
      </p>

      <p>
        And Wang Xu was following him, Jiang Cheng indeed felt speechless with
        just one glance at the whole scenario. He had said to employ a
        man-to-man defense just before the game started yet once the ball was
        deployed, not only had Wang Xu followed him, there were also two others
        following the ball-handler<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> and only a player
        wearing blue was following beside Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>He, on the other hand, was strictly marked by Lu Xiaobin.</p>

      <p>
        Guo Xu was pretty good. His dribble was very stable, though the speed
        was inadequate. When Jiang Cheng chased after, he had just entered the
        three-point line, preparing to pass the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        He reckoned that their plan was the same as Wang Xu’s: obtain the ball
        and give it to Gu Fei as soon as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at Gu Fei’s position then suddenly shifted to the
        side as he feinted<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a> at his opponents, Lu
        Xiaobin and another person, before forcibly charging smoothly past
        between the two of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        This advancement was pretty good; when Guo Xu caught sight of him, the
        ball had already been shot.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng swiftly reached out and blocked the ball.</p>

      <p>
        “Go back, go back!” Wang Xu reacted quickly and immediately ran back.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wound around to bring it back, but Lu Xiaobin blocked him at
        once.
      </p>

      <p>
        This guy was too big; as he closed in, Jiang Cheng could sense an
        earth-shattering presence. He took two steps, watching for an
        opportunity to pass the ball to Wang Xu from the side.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Wang Xu, this flipping blockhead, was unexpectedly so engrossed in
        advancing that he did not see the ball.
      </p>

      <p>“Wang Xu!” Jiang Cheng could only shout.</p>

      <p>
        Finally, Wang Xu hurriedly turned around and chased after, grabbing the
        ball just before it went out of bound.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took advantage of the moment that Lu Xiaobin twisted his
        head to look at the ball to break free from him and ran toward the
        basketball hoop. And with no one currently blocking Wang Xu, if he could
        bring the ball back, he could find a chance to score.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, Jiang Cheng hadn’t taken two steps yet when Gu Fei flew
        over to block him from the front. At the same moment, Wang Xu passed the
        ball over, even shouting: “Jiang Cheng!”
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >The fuck was that shout for huh! Did you intend to pass this ball to
          Gu Fei!!</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was simply speechless. At the same time that he caught the
        ball, he saw that Gu Fei’s hand had already reached over – the speed was
        astonishing.
      </p>

      <p>
        He hurriedly lowered the ball and dribbled between-the-legs, maneuvering
        left and right, back and forth. After adjusting himself a bit, he
        reduced his center of gravity with the intention of passing by.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Gu Fei did not give him such an opportunity. He practically moved at
        the same time with him, and his feinted jump didn’t fool Gu Fei in the
        slightest, even a fucking shift didn’t work.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck!</em></p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, not only he had incompetent teammates -Gu Fei also had
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was no one following the player in blue at the moment, that
        inadvertently allowed him to actually come up behind Gu Fei effortlessly
        – Jiang Cheng passed the ball to him from between Gu Fei’s legs.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Gu Fei turned, only to see that the player in blue had already
        reached the basketball hoop. He was probably quite speechless as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having received the ball, the player in blue was however hesitant; with
        just a glance at his appearance as he stood at the hoop, Jiang Cheng
        could see that he wanted to pass the ball.
      </p>

      <p>“Shoot it directly!” Jiang Cheng shouted.</p>

      <p>It was then that the player in blue jumped and shot the ball.</p>

      <p>Missed.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng knew that it wasn’t going to enter – it was considerably
        lucky enough to have the ball shot out of the baseline with that
        posture.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ball smashed the backboard and bounced off – it was still eight
        hundred miles away from the hoop.
      </p>

      <p>
        A group of people all jumped to grab the rebound, some fast and some
        slow, several hands confronted the ball as if it was an irreconcilable
        adversary that cannot coexist – members were actually snatching the ball
        from their own teammates. Jiang Cheng took the ball that eventually fell
        between them and went to the sideline.
      </p>

      <p>
        But at that moment, three opponents surrounded him in a semicircle. He
        needed a teammate to come.
      </p>

      <p>“Pass the ball,” someone said from the right.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng rapidly passed the ball over from the sideline.</p>

      <p>
        It was only when the ball had flown in the air that he suddenly reacted
        – <em>fucking hell, that was Gu Fei’s voice!</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure enough, when he turned his head to look, Gu Fei was holding the
        ball in his hands.
      </p>

      <p>“The fuck!” Jiang Cheng couldn’t help but curse out loud.</p>

      <p><em>This bitch is so devious!</em></p>

      <p>Gu Fei smirked.</p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng, what are you doing?!” Wang Xu roared.</p>

      <p>
        “Keep an eye on him!” Jiang Cheng was not in a good mood, “He’s running
        the entire court alone, why don’t you freaking follow him ah!!”
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was too late to take him down in a man-to-man defense. Gu Fei was
        quick with the ball, and with Jiang Cheng being pestered by two people,
        that made it difficult for him to make it over. By the time his
        incompetent teammates went to block Gu Fei, he was already at the
        free-throw line.<a href="#_ftn14">[14]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked on unfeelingly as he jumped with his hand gradually
        extending before the ball was lightly tossed and entered the hoop.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this ball having been personally delivered straight into Gu Fei’s
        hand by him, Jiang Cheng wanted to simply go over there and drag Gu Fei
        by the collar – <em>how can you be so cunning!</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng, look clearly at who the person is,” said a teammate
        wearing yellow running shoes. “You haven’t been able to distinguish us
        yet?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng said, “Sorry.”</p>

      <p>
        “Pass the ball to your teammates.” Captain Wang looked at him, “Not pass
        the ball to your deskmate!!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You better stand where I can pass the ball.” Jiang Cheng glanced his
        way, “The openings were all theirs to take, even if I didn’t pass it to
        the deskmate, I can only throw it out of bounds.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu raised his brows with a fairly unpleasant expression, and just
        as he was about to speak, the ball bounced over from the side.
      </p>

      <p>“Hurry up,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng caught the ball and passed it to Wang Xu, “You pass the
        ball, I take it over, you block the others and don’t let Gu Fei come
        near me, annoy the fuck out of him, pull his arm or kick his feet – even
        if you get a foul, don’t let him be open<a href="#_ftn15">[15]</a> at
        all.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Wang Xu glared at him.</p>

      <p>
        Lu Xiaobin was probably the most loyal to his responsibility of all the
        team members. When Wang Xu started with the ball, Lu Xiaobin stayed next
        to Jiang Cheng the entire time, inadvertently making it so that he could
        not throw the ball over for the longest time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng finally had no other choice as he suddenly charged for it
        and ran in front of Wang Xu, allowing him an opportunity to pass the
        ball to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Wang Xu could play ball fairly well. As Jiang Cheng maneuvered the
        ball through the court, Wang Xu remained guarding him at his side while
        Lu Xiaobin pressed toward him so closely that if it lasted any longer,
        the two of them would surely break into a brawl.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time, Gu Fei did not come to block him; the player in a blue shirt
        and the player with yellow shoes kept Gu Fei clamped between them –
        nearly just a hand away from a hug – but after Jiang Cheng passed the
        half-way line, he saw that Gu Fei had found an opportunity to break away
        from those two.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was no time to slowly enact a layup, thus, bearing the fiery hot
        anger directed at none other than Gu Fei –
        <em>that devious and cunning outlaw</em> – Jiang Cheng made a beeline to
        the three-point line<a href="#_ftn16">[16]</a>, and without stopping to
        adjust the ball, he shot it right before Gu Fei jumped to block it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ball was cast remarkably high, drew a huge arc in the air and then
        descended into the basketball hoop.
      </p>

      <p>“Holy shit, nice shot!” Wang Xu roared.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng let out a relaxing breath of air and gave Gu Fei a glance.
      </p>

      <p>“Beautiful,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        There wasn’t much feeling at all in playing a half-time game, especially
        playing in a team that wasn’t coordinating with each other, using a
        tactic of running around the whole field chaotically appeared to be
        hardworking, but obtaining points was rather pitiful.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Lao Xu whistled, he clapped his hands: “Pretty good, pretty good!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng especially wanted to ask,
        <em>which part was pretty good?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        “Right now, we have two strong generals in our ranks,” Lao Xu said. “But
        you’ve played for a long time without even breaking a rule, that’s no
        good! Break the rules, be brave! Be bold! Gu Fei, how do you think the
        game went?”
      </p>

      <p>“A big mess,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu was not very satisfied with his answer, hence, he turned to look
        at his Jiang Cheng: “Jiang Cheng, what do you think?”
      </p>

      <p>“Same,” Jiang Cheng replied freely.</p>

      <p>
        “Today is only the first day of training,” Lao Xu continued to say to
        himself, “There is still a lot of room for improvement! Have confidence
        in yourself! Do you have it or not?!”
      </p>

      <p>No one said anything.</p>

      <p>“Yes or no?!” Lao Xu waved his arm, “Answer me out loud!”</p>

      <p>Still, no one spoke.</p>

      <p>
        In fact, having played this half-time game, Jiang Cheng had more or less
        seen it all – aside from him and Gu Fei, it was obvious that the others
        didn’t normally play basketball at all, and the few that could play were
        just average.
      </p>

      <p>“Yes or…” Lao Xu continued encouragingly.</p>

      <p>
        “Yes,” Jiang Cheng honestly didn’t have the heart to look on as Lao Xu
        worked so hard only to not receive a response, thus he answered.
      </p>

      <p>“Yes,” Wang Xu also uttered.</p>

      <p>A group of people voiced, “yes” all the way through, half-dead.</p>

      <p>
        “Exactly! That’s right!” Lao Xu smiled happily at once, “Our goal this
        time is to reach the semifinals! Are you confident?!!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone continued to voice, “yes”, half-dead. Lao Xu nodded with
        satisfaction: “There’s half a month left until the competition. We still
        have enough time; besides gym class, you can also practice in the
        afternoon during self-study.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The appeal of this incentive was resplendent nevertheless, and the group
        immediately expressed their enthusiasm toward practicing properly from
        there on forth.
      </p>

      <p>
        From that time onward, Captain Wang did not have them continue to play,
        but rather: three-on-three, scoring was considered a win and the losing
        side would switch out a player.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei did not take the court again and instead sat on a stool to the
        side watching them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although there was nothing great about these people’s skill levels,
        Jiang Cheng had indeed not relaxed in such a long time – he unexpectedly
        felt that the game was quite enjoyable.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t block, craaapp!!” Guo Xu held the ball grudgingly, “Jiang Cheng,
        do you want to take a rest?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng, go rest,” Wang Xu said. “If you’re still in, there won’t
        be a need for subs.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright,” Jiang Cheng laughed and switched for Lu Xiaobin to go in; he
        sat to the side next to Lao Xu and watched on.
      </p>

      <p>“How is it?” Lao Xu asked.</p>

      <p>“How is what?” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>“This team,” Lao Xu replied.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng went silent, though he could still sense an intense surge of
        expectation exuding from Lao Xu.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Tomorrow, the two of you can team up and see how it goes?” Lao Xu
        asked.
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng nodded his head.</p>

      <p>
        “It’s difficult to enter the semifinals. Don’t have too much hope,” Gu
        Fei said from the side. “Let’s see which class we’ll go against in the
        knockout competition, if it’s class two, just immediately go home.”
      </p>

      <p>“Be optimistic!” Lao Xu said.</p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei looked at Lao Xu, “Ha, ha.”</p>

      <p>Once the dismal bell rang, many people entered the gymnasium.</p>

      <p>
        “Let’s go,” Wang Xu said. “They’re all here to train, we must maintain
        secrecy.”
      </p>

      <p>“Maintain what secrecy?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “The secrecy of our strength. We must maintain the image of noobs in the
        eyes of the other classes,” Wang Xu said, dead serious. “Also, we can’t
        let anyone know that Gu Fei is in the game, and that Jiang Cheng is a
        great ball player.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s right, we have two trump cards now.” Everyone nodded one after
        another, silently boring faces that endured humiliation as part of this
        important mission.
      </p>

      <p>“Everyone that came in just now saw me here,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“No worries,” Wang Xu said. “We’ll put on a show.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei sighed and stood up to put on his coat, turned and went to the
        doorway.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Wang Xu’s scream broke out from the depth of his throat,
        startling Jiang Cheng to the side. He glared at Gu Fei’s back, “Can’t
        you fucking have a collective sense of honor!”<a href="#_ftn17">[17]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei did not turn around, he only stuck up his middle finger from
        behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wang Xu,” a person that had just come in took off his jacket while
        laughingly saying: “There’s progress this time ah, at the very least, Da
        Fei came, right.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go,” Wang Xu got up and took the lead to walk out of the gymnasium.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng simply wanted to applaud Wang Xu. This show was excessive,
        and the acting advanced by leaps and bounds, and it was a hundredfold
        stronger than when he pretended to evade the captain’s position.　
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Miao isn’t here to wait for you today?” Jiang Cheng did not see Gu
        Miao hugging her skateboard at the entrance of the school.
      </p>

      <p>
        “She doesn’t necessarily come every day, sometimes she goes out to play
        by herself,” Gu Fei said. “Are you going to walk back now?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng answered simply.</p>

      <p>“I’ll take you?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng hesitated for a moment, “Oh.”</p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei went to get his bicycle, Jiang Cheng once more recalled the
        phrase that he had said during the game, “pass the ball”, and suddenly
        he became a bit angry: “Ai, I’ve found that you’ve very devious.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I just said it casually,” Gu Fei got on the bicycle and peddled over,
        “Who would have imagined that you would actually pass it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did you have nothing better to do than to casually say those damn words
        huh!!” Jiang Cheng followed and also got on the bicycle, “You’re
        insane.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s convenient to use during a game, just in case some fool on the
        other side passes it over,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>“Shit!” Jiang Cheng cursed.</p>

      <p>
        “I’ll call a few people to come practice tomorrow,” Gu Fei said. “It’s
        really pointless to keep playing like this.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Call who?” Jiang Cheng remembered the ‘shi-niao’ that Gu Fei brought to
        play ball last time and asked, “Them, Bu Shi Hao Niao?”
      </p>

      <p>“What?” Gu Fei stared blankly.</p>

      <p>
        “…… nothing,” Jiang Cheng quickly answered. “The few that played with
        you last time?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who is Bu Shi Hao Niao?” Gu Fei laughed, “Have you also taken me as a
        boss?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng went silent.</p>

      <p>“Yes, them.” Gu Fei didn’t question further, “Bu Shi Hao Niao.”</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng sighed.</p>

      <p>
        The two did not speak along the way. Jiang Cheng was lost in thought,
        staring at the piles of snow on the roadside;recently he had constantly
        been like this, when it was peaceful, his mind wandered – thinking
        trivialities over this and that – he would not be like this before, his
        mind wandering was just his mind wandering, and wherever it went, he
        never knew.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was unsure of when he could finally break free from this emotional
        Mariana Trench.<a href="#_ftn18">[18]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        With Gu Fei pedaling rather speedily, it did not take long to reach the
        street. He squeezed the brake, and after the bicycle slowed down, Jiang
        Cheng jumped off: “Thanks.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t speak and instead looked toward the street.</p>

      <p>
        At the same time, Jiang Cheng heard shrieks and screams travelling from
        the street of Li Baoguo’s place. He turned around only to catch sight of
        several people on the side of the street, trampling and kicking a fallen
        person on the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shit,” Jiang Cheng knitted his brows, this street was truly chalked
        with endless chaos every single day. “What now…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stopped the bike, locked it up beneath a tree to the side and
        looked at him: “The person on the ground is Li Baoguo.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p></p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei usually hated being bothered and did not like to meddle in
        troublesome matters. But growing up in this area, trouble was enacted on
        a daily basis. Every sort of dramatic script that usually played out in
        dramas could be seen here – and matters were only comparatively worse.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he was bored, he would watch these scenes occur here as if watching
        a drama on TV, and for a very long time, his inspiration for writing
        songs for Ding Zhuxin came from these people who were hopelessly, yet
        desperately, fighting from this bottom level – and to which it goes
        completely unseen by others.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >You watch him fall in despair, yet he seemed to be living full of
          vigor and laughed that you’re too maudlin.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Matters like Li Baoguo getting beaten up by people till he rolled on the
        ground was commonly seen. The main character was sometimes the same
        person, sometimes it changed, though none of it was a curious matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        On normal occasions, he would be here, sitting on the back seat of the
        bike, watching for a while.
      </p>

      <p>But today, he couldn’t just sit and watch.</p>

      <p>
        After Jiang Cheng clearly recognized the person to be Li Baoguo, the
        expression on his face changed so suddenly that Gu Fei didn’t know what
        to make of it – it was unclear to say if he was baffled or confused.
      </p>

      <p>
        If he was more familiar with Jiang Cheng – the same familiarity level as
        he had with Wang Jiuri would do – he would definitely pull back Jiang
        Cheng and refrain him from going up.
      </p>

      <p>
        This type of situation usually wouldn’t cause deaths, neither sides were
        good people anyhow, and no one was unjustly beaten up. To break a few
        bones and shed a few drops of blood was to receive a good lesson,
        sometimes it could also solve a few unsettled matters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng said nothing as he turned in silence and walked toward them
        – Gu Fei felt an ominous feeling rise up. It was not exactly sympathy,
        this world had too many people who needed sympathizing, hence, it didn’t
        at all matter who sympathized with who.
      </p>

      <p>It was probably helplessness.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei did not know that Li Baoguo once had a younger son, nor did he
        know if it was as Li Baoguo had claimed – he was sent away because they
        couldn’t afford to raise him. A person like Li Baoguo, it would be of no
        surprise either if he claimed to have sold off Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        He could not obtain Jiang Cheng’s thoughts on this in any way; his proud
        temperament drastically stood apart from those who grew up in this
        place. A person like this, confronted with a scene like this, and a…
        father like this, only God knew what that would taste like.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anyhow, he approached them in utter silence and maybe because the
        relationship he had with Li Baoguo was so foreign to him, he didn’t
        appear to be caught in a mood of anxious bewilderment, nor anger.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stretched his back lazily, and from a distance of a dozen metres
        away, he too slowly moved his way toward them, pulling his glasses on
        while at it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not try to intervene in the fight, he didn’t even speak
        a word. Throwing his bag against the wall, he walked over, and with one
        elbow, he smashed it right against the back of the person who was busy
        kicking Li Baoguo on the head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was definitely familiar with how to use his elbow; his hits
        were all very powerful too – Gu Fei had experienced it.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this blow, the person yelled out and flipped around. Gu Fei
        recognized him to be someone from the steel mill, nicknamed Da Diao<a
          href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >, yet no one could textually prove whether this name was based on his
        actual body conditions. These people came to play cards regularly, and
        normally only allowed themselves to be slick cheats while refraining
        others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before Da Diao could respond, Jiang Cheng aimed right at his face that
        had just turned around and smashed against it with his own forehead –
        centred right at the nose bridge.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei suddenly felt his own nose begin to tinkle faintly.</p>

      <p>
        Immediately after, Jiang Cheng grabbed Da Diao by the collar and harshly
        pushed him to the side; he stumbled and fell into the arms of the two
        people who stood behind him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The few people who had their heads down and were focused on beating up
        Li Baoguo soon realized that someone had sneak attacked them, swearing,
        they quickly recollected themselves through the momentary chaos and
        turned their attention to Jiang Cheng. 　
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck! The hell do you want?” Someone swore, with one hand raised, he
        swung a fist right toward Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        To Gu Fei’s surprise, Jiang Cheng did not even bother to dodge. He
        charged straight toward the fist and allowed it to graze past the corner
        of his eye before landing his own fist heavily upon the other’s left
        eye.
      </p>

      <p>
        And just like that, these people who were still swimming in confusion
        were completely infuriated. They collectively gave up on Li Baoguo, who
        had shrunk into a ball on the ground, and flew toward Jiang Cheng with
        raised fists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei scrunched his eyebrows, looking around to find that the floor was
        quite clean – if Jiang Cheng couldn’t hold on for too long and he was to
        help, there wasn’t even a brick in sight.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t hit!” Li Baoguo held his head while curling up on the ground,
        screaming his lungs out, “Stop hitting!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Those people who dove toward Jiang Cheng didn’t bother to acknowledge
        him. Though no one had any weapons on them, they had large builds – a
        fist thrown by them was quite something to endure.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>One, two, three, four</em>, Gu Fei slowly counted, there were four
        people circling Jiang Cheng. There was also one who couldn’t squeeze in
        and instead jumped around outside the invisible ring.
      </p>

      <p>
        But before this person could jump a third time, someone already flew out
        from the circle and landed on the ground.
      </p>

      <p>He was kicked out by Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng soon dashed out and aimed one foot right toward the stomach
        of the guy on the floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” The blood flowing from Da Diao’s face was smeared all across his
        face. While screaming and jumping up, he threw a kick onto Jiang Cheng’s
        back; his posture was unseemly, yet it was full of power.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stumbled forward quite a few steps before eventually coming
        to a full stop and raising his hand to wipe the corner of his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned around to see Da Diao running up to build momentum for a
        second kick. Jiang Cheng stood still, and when Da Diao jumped up, he
        suddenly leaned forward, body charging forward with his arm aiming right
        at Da Diao’s… da diao.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Da Diao couldn’t even make a sound and just like that, he fell to the
        ground, gasping with his mouth wide open – a face full of searing pain.
        　　
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei lifted his glasses, if he saw correctly, Jiang Cheng probably
        didn’t hit right on the ‘spot’ with this blow, otherwise, Da Diao would
        have probably fainted from pain by now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Did he miss accidentally, or was it that even in a situation like this,
        Jiang Cheng could still control his temperament and not cross the line?
      </p>

      <p>
        But due to the fact that Da Diao’s posture was overtly tragic, his
        buddies – Two, Three, Four, Five Diao – were caught in momentary
        hesitations.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is how these people are. When beating up someone like Li Baoguo,
        they all acted as if they were courageous warriors, but once they come
        across someone hardcore, they instantly become cowards. Afraid of going
        one on one, yet even if the whole myriad was to be dispatched, they
        would still have to wait for someone to take the lead.
      </p>

      <p>
        But in their moment of hesitation, Jiang Cheng had already rushed toward
        them again, striking ferociously into the one standing in the front.
        Perhaps because a xueba was adept at learning, he actually jumped for
        this strike – a move learned from Da Diao – though his posture was much,
        much more beautiful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only that, what he used was his shoulder, hence when he jumped, his
        shoulder went for the person’s chin as the crow flew.
      </p>

      <p>
        The person was struck till he retreated at once, and his eyes met the
        sky in a jump before collapsing on the ground – though it was not known
        whether that strike caused him to bite into his tongue or nick his lips,
        but he covered his mouth, and once he released his hands, they were
        drenched in blood.
      </p>

      <p>
        After two of them were taken down, the remaining three probably felt
        somewhat threatened but seeing that the number was on their side and
        they still had the upper-hand, they charged at Jiang Cheng
        simultaneously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng estimated that he was injured when he was surrounded just
        now, and since he did not escape at this time, he was encircled in the
        middle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei could clearly see that his stomach and waist had received several
        hard punches; he sighed and walked over.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he walked down the sidewalk, he caught sight of someone being
        thrown down by Jiang Cheng. His face was pressed to the ground, followed
        by several swift and precise swings – two of which landed heavily on the
        neck – that person struggled in between coughs and howls.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two that were unsuccessful in pulling Jiang Cheng away lifted their
        feet and kicked his back as a result. After suffering a few of those
        kicks, Jiang Cheng swung his arm back and grabbed one of the legs then
        with a rough yank and a turn of his body, he pressed down on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        That person was not flexible, and obviously unable to bear such a
        forcible split – evident by the loud sounds of wailing tearing from his
        throat. When he attempted to kick yet had no strength, he could only
        swing at Jiang Cheng but even those held no strength.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment, the other person that was still standing lifted his leg;
        Gu Fei saw him aim at the back of Jiang Cheng’s head.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey,” Gu Fei screamed and agilely pulled out a dictionary from his
        schoolbag.
      </p>

      <p>
        When that person looked up, Gu Fei savagely smashed the dictionary in
        his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        An English-Chinese dictionary – whoever didn’t bring it to English
        class, Lao Lu would be irritated with them. Though the price was not
        expensive, it was nevertheless also quite practical and the hardcover
        kind. Gu Fei had never before opened it, hence, the integrity of its
        sturdiness persisted from when it was first purchased – so, as it flew
        over without opening, it smashed the face with the same effect as a
        brick.
      </p>

      <p>
        After that person was struck with this dictionary, inadvertently, going
        motionless all at once, they looked at Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei did not speak as he walked over to pick up his dictionary, rub
        the dirt off of it with his pants and returned it back into his
        schoolbag.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment, Jiang Cheng also released his hand from that person’s
        leg and stood up.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You fucki…” The one that suffered a hit from the dictionary stared at
        Jiang Cheng, unsure of what to say but before he could finish, Jiang
        Cheng interrupted him.
      </p>

      <p>“Is there anything else?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        The one standing and the one on the ground were both stunned, and no one
        spoke.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If there’s nothing else, I’m leaving.” Jiang Cheng turned around to
        pick up his schoolbag and walked in the direction of the other street.
      </p>

      <p>“You know him?” someone asked Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei glanced at him: “Just get lost.”　　</p>

      <p><em>Hurts.</em></p>

      <p>
        His whole fucking body hurt, and he could not tell clearly which part
        hurt exactly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng gritted his teeth and every step he took forward simply felt
        strenuous.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was refreshing, like after running a marathon – the ache, the
        pain and the weakness, yet each deep gasp was penetrating, and each
        breath could cool down to the intestines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Exactly why did Li Baoguo suffer a beating<em>,</em> he originally
        wanted to ask, but after going through this, he no longer wanted to
        know. He only knew that this was how this person lived, crawling on the
        ground – regardless of whether it was himself or Li Baoguo, nothing
        would change.
      </p>

      <p>Extreme anger and hopelessness.</p>

      <p>Agitation, hatred – all derived from those.</p>

      <p>
        He was not such a great person. He did not want to save anyone or change
        anyone. He had only thought that this person was his biological father.
        He could not erase this no matter what, so he must strive to adapt.
      </p>

      <p>
        But he could try to adapt to Li Baoguo’s vulgarity, his sloppiness, his
        male chauvinism, his gambling addiction, his alcohol addiction, however,
        he discovered that Li Baoguo displayed not only those. There were just
        too many that he was unable to adapt to and also unable to accept,
        little by little emerging before his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Stealing, getting beaten up till he was rolling on the ground. What
          else was there, and how many more?</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>Someone whistled from behind him.</p>

      <p>
        Even without turning his head, he knew that it was Gu Fei, hence, he did
        not turn – turning meant that his neck would hurt.
      </p>

      <p>“Go get it checked at the hospital,” Gu Fei said from behind.</p>

      <p>“No need,” Jiang Cheng answered depressingly.</p>

      <p>
        “Wanna bet on it?” Gu Fei did not catch up to him but followed from
        behind.
      </p>

      <p>“What,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “Your rib is broken,” Gu Fei said, “Go get it checked. If it’s broken,
        you have to help me write my assignments for a week and let me copy off
        of you during exams but if it’s not broken, I’ll treat you to a meal.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng stopped.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei walked up and stood by his side, “Is it broken?”</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know, I’ve never broken a bone before – never experienced it.”
        Jiang Cheng swept a glance his way, “You must be experienced, do you
        break it often?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed: “I should have let that person break your neck just
        now.”
      </p>

      <p>“Thanks for that,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        <em>My rib must be broken… </em>Jiang Cheng felt that normally when he
        fought, any hits would strike the stomach, but it should not still hurt
        this much after a long while.
      </p>

      <p>“Which is the nearest hospital?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “There’s a coal mine hospital,” Gu Fei said. “It’s about five minutes by
        taxi.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng took a few steps forward, gritted his teeth and turned
        around, “Thanks.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re so polite that I want to bow and say, ‘you’re welcome’,” Gu Fei
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not speak anymore. After leaving the street and waiting
        for just two minutes, with some luck, a taxi drove over, and he hailed
        for it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m handing this over to the next shift. You have to get another taxi,”
        the driver said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I need to go to the hospital, any later, I’ll die on the street.” Jiang
        Cheng looked at him, “I probably have acute enteritis.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The driver stared at him: “Get in then, I’ll take you to the hospital
        then hand it over.”
      </p>

      <p>“Thank you,” Jiang Cheng got in the car.</p>

      <p>
        The moment he sat in the back seat, he almost cried out in pain – the
        change of position made the ribs on the right-sideache severely as if
        they had been punched again.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fought with others right,” the driver drove while looking at him from
        the rearview mirror. “Acute enteritis doesn’t injure the face.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is my face injured?” Jiang Cheng asked – the injury on his mouth, he
        knew about since it was reeking of blood.
      </p>

      <p>
        The driver laughed: “There, but it doesn’t look too serious, definitely
        hasn’t damage your look.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng uttered.</p>

      <p>
        “Young man, don’t be so impulsive,” the driver said. “You might be
        indifferent if something happens to you, but your family will be
        worried. Tell me, isn’t that so.”
      </p>

      <p>“… mm,” Jiang Cheng pulled back the corner of his lips, smirking.</p>

      <p>
        The corner of his mouth was probably injured too, just that slight pull
        extended the pain all the way to the root of his ears.　
      </p>

      <p><em>Your family will be worried.</em></p>

      <p><em>Tell me, isn’t that so.</em></p>

      <p><em>Really?</em> <em>Who is family huh?</em></p>

      <p>
        His previous family would never know his current situation at all, and
        when he fought before, he would not let them know either, yet now… his
        father was beside him, holding his head the entire time without saying a
        word.
      </p>

      <p>And when he left, Li Baoguo didn’t even glance at him.</p>

      <p><em>Who will be worried huh? How funny.</em></p>

      <p>
        When he arrived at the hospital, he went to the emergency room, but no
        one was there.
      </p>

      <p>
        After telling the doctor that his rib might be broken, the doctor placed
        his hands around his chest and pressed: “Does it hurt anywhere?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng tried to sense it out seriously, “… no.”</p>

      <p>“Doesn’t hurt?” the doctor said, “Let me check.”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng unzipped his jacket and when he lowered his head to lift up
        his sweater, he suddenly saw bloodstains on it. He froze, “The heck?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor lifted his shirt: “You were cut here, right? From the
        appearance, it doesn’tlook like a fracture… let me listen to detect if
        there are any crepitus<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> again.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh.” Jiang Cheng was baffled about the mysterious phenomenon of how
        his clothes weren’t torn yet he was injured and gushed quite a bit of
        blood.
      </p>

      <p>
        The doctor examined it thoroughly and finally pressed his hand on the
        wound: “Does the bone hurt?”
      </p>

      <p>“The muscle,” Jiang Cheng answered.</p>

      <p>
        “There are no bone fractures,” the doctor said. “If you’re still
        worried, we can get an X-ray.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng let out a sigh of relief: “There’s no need.”</p>

      <p>
        The wound above his rib area was not serious, and the doctor simply
        treated it with a piece of gauze.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sat down on the hospital chair and stared blankly for a long
        time. Eventually the pain that riddled his body slowly subsided
        substantially, and the intensifying soreness in his muscle that had
        first seemed to explode deeply within was alleviated.He pressed his
        finger on his clothes to feel his ribs one by one but couldn’t sense
        anything – anywhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Damn it!</em> <em>Gu Fei, that nut case</em>. He had sounded so
        positive in his conviction, as if he had plenty of experience. Jiang
        Cheng had no intentions of visiting the hospital but was scared into
        doing so.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, his first reaction upon knowing that his rib was not fractured
        was surprisingly – great – since it would not affect the basketball
        competition.
      </p>

      <p>
        He actually had such a strong collective sense of honor, perhaps, Lao
        Xu’s magnanimous love runs a silent.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        The phone rang in his bag, and as he pulled it out and saw the number on
        the screen, he froze.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was mother’s call. Although he had already deleted the family of
        four’s phone numbers, he could not erase mother’s number from his mind
        in such a short time.
      </p>

      <p>“Hello,” he answered the call.</p>

      <p>
        “Xiao Cheng ah?” Mother’s voice transmitted over, “I haven’t been in
        touch with you for a while now, there’s a lot of things happening at
        home, how are you doing?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng went silent and didn’t speak. He didn’t know what to say nor
        what he could say. His mind was chaotic like the fighting scene just
        now, with only a buzzing sound remaining.
      </p>

      <p>“Did you receive everything I sent over?” Mother asked again.</p>

      <p>
        “I got it,” Jiang Cheng closed his eyes and sucked in a breath of air.
      </p>

      <p>“You and your… dad, how are you getting along?” Mother asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Quite well.” Jiang Cheng bit his lips, though the pain in the corner of
        his torn lips caused him to frown, “He is my father after all.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Mother laughed: “That’s good, I was a bit worried at first since I
        thought he was a rather rough person. I was afraid that you…”
      </p>

      <p>“I’m fine,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        Mother went silent on the other side, seemingly trying to find a topic
        to talk about.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m doing quite well,” Jiang Cheng lowered his head and looked at his
        shoes, unaware of when it was stepped on for there to be mud on a
        section of it. “Don’t worry.”
      </p>

      <p>“Xiao Cheng…” Mother called him and then sighed again.</p>

      <p>
        “I’m doing fine now and have adapted pretty well. I still have things to
        do,” Jiang Cheng said. “I have to go.”
      </p>

      <p>Without waiting for Mother to speak, he hung up the call.</p>

      <p>
        He absent-mindedly stared at the black screen before he stood up and
        left the hospital.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I wasn’t gonna come over,” Yi Jing stood in front of the cash register,
        backpack in her arms. “But I was passing by coincidently… Xu Zong said
        you guys are getting ready to compete in a basketball tournament. I was
        thinking you probably don’t have time to review for your midterms,
        right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m not reviewing whether or not I have time,” Gu Fei poured her a cup
        of hot water and dropped a slice of lemon inside. “You’re more anxious
        than Lao Xu.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s not it,” Yi Jing smiled timidly. “I just have a lot of spare
        time on hand.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei smiled too: “Sure, how ‘bout you let me copy today’s homework,
        I’ll…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No copying,” Yi Jing spoke immediately with sternness. “If you don’t
        understand something, I can teach you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei then thought, well I could just copy Jiang Cheng’s, but he still
        took out his textbook from his bag: “Fine, then teach me English, I only
        plan on doing English homework today.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fine,” Yi Jing sighed. “English is the only homework that you’re afraid
        of not doing right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei stood up and erected the small table on the side. “Lao Lu’s
        homework is not something anyone isn’t afraid of lacking.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yi Jing pulled over a stool and sat down. She opened the textbook and
        started to work through the questions with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s interest was adrift – anything that had to do with studying, he
        had always been adrift. Even if it was Lao Lu sitting in front of him
        right now, his mind would still be wondering the universe right now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yi Jing is Lao Xu’s number one helping hand, and like Lao Xu, she held a
        heart full of enthusiastic passion for this class. Despite the fact that
        last semester, when she just assumed her position, Wang Xu had angered
        her to tears – twice – during the self-study period, she still hadn’t
        forgotten her initial passion.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This is…” Yi Jing said as she wrote on the draft paper. “Look here……”
      </p>

      <p>
        The shop curtains were lifted by someone, and Gu Fei turned only to see
        Jiang Cheng standing frozen at the entrance with a hand still holding up
        the curtains.
      </p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng?” Yi Jing turned to stare at him, a bit surprised.</p>

      <p>
        “Ah,” Jiang Cheng responded a bit awkward and pointed outside. “How
        ‘bout I…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No, don’t, you need Gu Fei for something?” Yi Jing responded
        immediately and also stood up somewhat awkwardly, “I just came here to
        teach him the homework… if you have matters to talk about, I’ll leave
        first… actually why don’t you teach him?”
      </p>

      <p>“Ah?” Jiang Cheng froze again.</p>

      <p>
        “Lu Laoshi said your English grades are really good,” Yi Jing smiled
        while gathering all her belongings. “I’ll be leaving then.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey, you…” Jiang Cheng didn’t get a chance to finish his sentence, Yi
        Jing had already slipped past him in an embarrassed manner. 　
      </p>

      <p>“Did you go to the hospital for a look?’ Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng walked in and hesitantly stood beside the shelf.
        “Treat me to a meal.”
      </p>

      <p>“It’s not broken?” Gu Fei was surprised.</p>

      <p>
        “What, are you disappointed that it’s not broken?” Jiang Cheng said.
        “Then why don’t you come over and break it for me.”
      </p>

      <p>“What do you want to eat?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know, anything is fine,” Jiang Cheng scrunched his eyebrows.
        “I’m starving to death, and annoyed.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay,” Gu Fei stood up and gave it some thought. “I’ll take you to eat
        my favourite food.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t know just what Gu Fei’s “favourite thing to eat” that
        he was taking him to was, and he didn’t ask either. He wasn’t even in
        the mood to eat at the moment. Anything he ate would probably taste the
        same anyway.
      </p>

      <p>He only came to find Gu Fei because he didn’t want to be alone.</p>

      <p>
        He didn’t want to go back, didn’t want to see Li Baoguo, didn’t want to
        know what he looked like after getting beaten up, didn’t want to hear Li
        Baoguo’s reason for the whole ordeal, didn’t want this, didn’t want
        that… just a multitude of “didn’t want”. It was enough to fill his
        originally empty mind, and there wasn’t anything he could do to stop it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Plus, in this city, aside from Li Baoguo’s place and the school, the
        only other place he could go to was Gu Fei’s shop. It was pretty sad
        when he thought about it, but there wasn’t anything he could do.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei tidied up the shop a bit and then shut the door, “Wait for me a
        bit, I’m going to get the ride.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng wanted to ask whether it was a bike or motorcycle
        since it was so cold out that he really wasn’t that keen on riding it if
        it was a motorcycle. He would rather walk if that was the case, however,
        Gu Fei had already walked straight into the small alley next to the
        shop.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whatever then, just how cold could it be? The Spring Basketball
        Competition was coming soon, so thinking along that line, it was already
        spring.
      </p>

      <p>How marvellous.</p>

      <p>
        The sound of a motor resounded from the small alleyway; but that sound
        seemed rather weak in comparison to Gu Fei’s 250cc motorcycle.<a
          href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Just when Jiang Cheng was growing a little confused, a small
        cornmeal-coloured car that resembled a bun or even a mini bun drilled
        out of the alleyway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng watched, a little stupefied, as the ‘bun’ teetered to a stop
        in front of him. He then opened the door to the small vehicle.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hop in,” Gu Fei called out as he looked at him from inside the small
        bun.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What… is this thing?” Jiang Cheng stared at the car. If he was seeing
        things correctly, this should be a small version of an elderly’s
        scooter.
      </p>

      <p>
        “A car ah,” Gu Fei replied. “It can block the wind and rain, and even
        run on gas, much, much better than the ones that run on battery.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh.” Jiang Cheng walked over and stood beside the car door, then
        stared for a long time. “How the hell do I get in?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei glanced behind him and got out of the car, “You can… crawl in
        first.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was a little hesitant. Gu Fei then added, “Even if I drive a
        beetle, you’d still have to crawl in if you want to get in the back,
        right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “If it was a beetle I would be sitting in the co-pilot, okay?!” Jiang
        Cheng retorted.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hurry up,” Gu Fei took out his phone and quickly checked the time, “His
        family’s shop closes at nine.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had to squeeze into a space that was one foot wide between
        the door and the driver’s seat. His injury was throbbing, and the
        intensifying pain left him on the verge of tears.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had seen old men use this thing to take their wives out to play; just
        how did those old ladies get in?
      </p>

      <p>
        After he sat down, Gu Fei reached out and pulled down the back of the
        driver’s seat, “Couldn’t you have just pulled this down?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at the much wider space that appeared in just a short
        amount of time and suddenly had the impulse to get out of the car and
        smack Gu Fei. He pointed straight at him, “You shut up.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei shut the door, started the car, and drove toward the street.</p>

      <p>
        The car was so small that even when Jiang Cheng was sitting in the
        backseat, it felt no different from sitting in the backseat of Gu Fei’s
        bike.
      </p>

      <p>However, it indeed blocked the wind and rain.</p>

      <p>
        Looking out from the tiny car window, there was an inexplicable illusion
        of wandering on the street, scrounging for a whole day, and finally
        getting on the cornmeal-coloured bun to find a cheap stall for a bowl of
        noodles or something.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your family owns this car?” Jiang Cheng asked as he knocked against the
        plastic coverings.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En” Gu Fei made a sound of affirmation. “My mom bought this car.
        Sometimes it’s pretty convenient when you’ve got a load to carry.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh.” Jiang Cheng glanced at where he was seated, “How much can you
        carry with just this little bit of space?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Our shop doesn’t have many goods to pick up,” Gu Fei answered. “Usually
        there’s some people to deliver it over andsometimes we pick it up
        ourselves.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t speak up again as he watched Gu Fei drive past the
        bridge from that day. He guessed that if there was a place with anything
        delicious around the area, it would be on this side of the bridge.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>What could it be?</em> He saw a lot of shops when he went to eat
        dumplings that day; hotpots, skewers, western cuisine, Chinese food and
        the like. However, he didn’t want Gu Fei to treat him to something too
        expensive. You had to return the favour properly, it was too
        troublesome.
      </p>

      <p>
        The small bun drove past the various shops lining the two sides of the
        street, yet it did not stop, instead, it kept on going forward until it
        turned right into a small street next to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Still not there yet?” Jiang Cheng couldn’t help himself from asking
        after feeling as though they had already left the area where they could
        eat.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Almost there, it’s just up ahead.” Just as Gu Fei answered, he swerved
        into yet another street.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng peered outside. This area was the same as Li Baoguo’s place
        – a dilapidated old part of the city with an especially downcast air.
      </p>

      <p>
        The car slowed down and stopped in front of a few small restaurants.
        Jiang Cheng stared at them for a while. There was a bun shop, a noodle
        shop, and another shop that was…
      </p>

      <p>“Come out.” Gu Fei opened the car door and hopped out.</p>

      <p>
        “Hold on,” Jiang Cheng was a little confused as he squeezed out, “Why do
        I feel like these are breakfast shops?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “They also sell breakfast.” Gu Fei shut the car door and pressed on the
        remote.
      </p>

      <p>
        “My god, a car this small even has a remote control?” Jiang Cheng was
        stupefied.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This car is one that even runs on oil; if even a battery-operated car
        has a remote control, why wouldn’t this one?” Gu Fei walked over to one
        of the stores, “It’s this one.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at the shop; even though it had lights lit at the
        front, from the door to the lighting or the environment, it still seemed
        like a shady shop.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once he saw the four characters written with a calligraphy brush hung
        beside the door that was downright ugly it could even compete with his
        writing, he froze.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wang, Er, Stuffed, Flatbread<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>?” He pointed at
        the signboard, “You’ve brought me to eat meat pies in the middle of the
        night?”
      </p>

      <p>“It’s really good,” Gu Fei parted the curtain, “Smell it.”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wasn’t in much of a mood to smell anything. The first dinner
        he was going to have with the guy was stuffed flatbread – to that, he
        still hadn’t recovered from his state of shock. However, all the tables
        in the shop were actually full and the business here was pretty good.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet, when he followed Gu Fei into the shop and caught sight of the
        waiter carrying over a pot of soup to the customers, the shock factor
        simply multiplied – his eyes almost popped out of their sockets.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei, you came?!” Wang Xu threw the soup on a table. When he turned
        and saw Jiang Cheng, he also took a double take. “Fuck, Jiang Cheng?
        Someone as troublesome<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> as you also came along?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah,” Jiang Cheng sounded, watching as the bowlful of the soup that Wang
        Xu gave to the customer spilled on the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey! What the hell, half the pot has spilled out!” an indignant
        customer cursed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll get you another pot in a bit,” Wang Xu grabbed a rag and briskly
        wiped across the table and considered the job done. He walked to Gu Fei
        and Jiang Cheng, “How about the boxed room upstairs? It so happens to be
        empty.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Boxed room?” Jiang Cheng felt that he was never going to snap out of
        his daze – a flatbread restaurant had a boxed room.
      </p>

      <p>
        The boxed room actually was a boxed room. All four sides were separated
        by wooden boards; there was even a small air conditioner.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng, what’s wrong with your face?” Wang Xu turned on the air
        conditioner in the box and stared at Jiang Cheng’s face. “Did you fight
        with somebody? Was it Hou Zi…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No,” Jiang Cheng cut him off. Even if it was only a passing breeze or
        the rustling of the grass, Wang Xu would still think it was Hou Zi. He
        almost felt like he owed Wang Xu if he didn’t pick a fight with Hou Zi
        again.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Beef, pork, mutton, donkey, we’ll have a couple of each,” Gu Fei turned
        to Wang Xu. “And mutton soup. Have you eaten yet? If you haven’t, then
        have a piece.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wait a moment, I’ll get it for you guys,” Wang Xu said. “I found two
        bottles of good wine that my dad hid, let’s drink some later.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After he left, Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Fei, “This place was opened by
        Wang Xu’s family?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei nodded. “Wang Er is his dad. This place is pretty
        well-known in the city; there are even some people who drive all the way
        from the developed areas just to come here to eat.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah,” Jiang Cheng made a sound of understanding, feeling that there was
        nothing else he could say.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m going to get some soup.” Gu Fei got up and headed out, “Have some
        soup first.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After two minutes, he returned with three medium-sized pots of mutton
        soup on a large tray. Jiang Cheng could perceive that he was probably –
        finally – starting to return to reality. When he smelled the mutton
        soup, he had the feeling that he could devour all the pots.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not long after, Wang Xu came in holding a simple basket containing
        around seven or eight stuffed flatbreads. “Fresh out of the oven. Eat
        while it’s hot, you can get some more later.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng grabbed one and took a bite, immediately feeling so moved
        from how delicious it was that he could shed tears. He practically
        swallowed without chewing it.
      </p>

      <p>“The donkey meat one,” Wang Xu looked at him, “How is it?”</p>

      <p>“Extremely,” Jiang Cheng took another bite, “Delicious.”</p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu smiled proudly, “It’s got to be delicious! The donkey meat one
        is a must-have, anyone who comes has to eat at least two of them. Da Fei
        can eat ten!”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng estimated that he could eat more than ten.</p>

      <p>
        The stuffed flatbreads from Wang Xu’s place weren’t very big, one was
        around half the size of a palm. The skin was thin, and the amount of
        filling was generous, both thick and soft, each bite was filled with the
        fragrance of meat – not greasy at all…
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu snuck over one of the bottles of wine that his dad hid. You
        couldn’t tell what brand it was since there wasn’t a label on the
        bottle, though the bottle looked pretty filthy.
      </p>

      <p>“Want some?” Wang Xu brought a cup in front of Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng shook his head. He didn’t have a habit of drinking white
        wine, and nobody at ‘home’ drank either. He would only drink some beer
        when he went out with Pan Zhi.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Too bad,” Wang Xu poured himself and Gu Fei two cups, “The xueba is
        pretty abstinent.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was too lazy to make a retort. Besides, he was eating his
        family’s flatbreads, and they were pretty damn delicious.
      </p>

      <p>
        The meal was incredibly satisfying with various types of flatbreads
        stuffed to the brim and thick mutton broth. He ate till both his heart
        was full and his body was warm; the various wounds on his body – which
        he couldn’t even tell which hurt more than the other – suddenly all felt
        a whole lot better. The sharp pain became a dull throb in his flesh.
      </p>

      <p>
        Out of the three of them, Wang Xu was the one that continued to talk
        without a break while Jiang Cheng barely made a sound. Wang Xu talked
        about things regarding their class, and with Jiang Cheng still unable to
        distinguish people, there wasn’t any place for him to cut in even if he
        wanted to talk. Gu Fei didn’t speak much either, opting instead to just
        sit and eat while occasionally making a few “en, en” sounds but Wang Xu
        didn’t seem to mind much.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I heard that Class 2 is getting outside help this time,” Wang Xu
        started talking about the basketball game, “Should we get some too?
        Otherwise, how will we win?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you want me and Jiang Cheng to go up with three outsiders?” Gu Fei
        replied. “Would there be any point in winning?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu frowned and thought for a bit, “There really wouldn’t be any
        point. If it’s like that then I wouldn’t even get a chance to go on.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “With your level, you wouldn’t even be able to get on the court if we
        get outside help,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck!” Wang Xu felt a little indignant.</p>

      <p>
        “I’ll just call some friends over for practice tomorrow.” Gu Fei
        continued, “It’s impossible to make any improvements at this point.
        Let’s instead practice a bit more to improve our cooperation and
        familiarize ourselves with each other.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Right!” Wang Xu glanced at Jiang Cheng, “Don’t pass the ball to the
        other side again.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I pass exclusively to my deskmate, not exclusively to the other side.”
        Jiang Cheng drank a mouthful of soup, “My deskmate and I are on the same
        side.”
      </p>

      <p>“… don’t talk back,” Wang Xu scoffed.</p>

      <p>“Talk back if you disagree,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>
        After eating the stuffed flatbreads at Wang Xu’s shop for an hour, Jiang
        Cheng walked out of the restaurant feeling like the wound on his stomach
        was going to tear open again from how bloated he felt.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Come by more often when you’re free!” Wang Xu’s mother sent them out
        the door, “Auntie will give you a discount! Any classmate of Wang Xu
        will get a discount!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Thank you, Auntie,” Jiang Cheng said, burping a bit in the beginning.
      </p>

      <p>He really ate too much.</p>

      <p>
        He was even half-sprawled over the backseat when he got back in the car.
      </p>

      <p>“I’m drunk,” Gu Fei started up the car.</p>

      <p>“What the hell did you say?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        Even though the meal made him incredibly happy, once he got off the
        small bun and caught sight of the street leading up to Li Baoguo’s
        place, a feeling of exhaustion welled up from inside him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He lowered his head and walked in the wind, one step at a time, until he
        helplessly reached the entrance of the corridor.
      </p>

      <p>
        The lights were out when he opened the door. He felt along the wall for
        a long time before he finally found the switch and slapped on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know why he still hadn’t grown accustomed to the fact that the
        light switches in Li Baoguo’s place were a little higher than the ones
        in his old house.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo wasn’t at home, and whether he was at the hospital or out
        gambling, he didn’t know either. He took out his phone and hesitated for
        a while, but in the end, he still didn’t dial.
      </p>

      <p>He hastily washed up and returned to his room.</p>

      <p>
        After he finished his homework, he took a glance at the time – it was
        almost eleven o’clock.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know which household upstairs it was that was hitting their
        child but hearing the child’s cries and screams was enough to frighten
        someone. It felt as if the child was going to be beaten to death at any
        second.
      </p>

      <p>
        He lied down on his back, took out and put on his earphones, and closed
        his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had finally realized just how determined Lao Xu was to win a
        basketball game. He announced in the morning that those participating in
        the basketball game could skip Chinese class and go to the gym to train.
      </p>

      <p>
        That inadvertently made Gu Fei call the Bu Shi Hao Niao bunch, and tell
        them to come in the morning.
      </p>

      <p>“It’s not like you guys listen in class anyways,” Lao Xu said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wanted to tell him, you know I listen if I’m in class,
        right? I’m a xueba after all.
      </p>

      <p>
        There wasn’t anybody else in the gymnasium in the morning. Jiang Cheng
        looked at the enthusiastic group of people and was overwhelmed with
        mixed emotions. Honestly speaking, he didn’t have any confidence that
        these people could win the game – whether they won or lost depended
        entirely on how bad the other classes were.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Our exclusive training team will arrive in a while,” Wang Xu squatted
        on the sidelines. “The starting team that we agreed on the other day
        goes up first. Find the feeling.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “If anybody asks about this, just say that Gu Fei brought some people to
        practice with us,” Wang Xu said and then thought for a while before
        adding another sentence. “Remember what to say and to say it super
        angrily. Let people think that we had to beg them all day for them to
        come. That person there has no collective sense of honour!”
      </p>

      <p>Everybody nodded, their faces simmering with bitterness.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei sighed.</p>

      <p>
        Bu Shi Hao Niao arrived at a pretty good time. They came in right after
        the bell rang, avoiding the period where the school was packed with
        people.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was just that, the fact that this group of people who practically had
        “go find a professional” atop their heads could simply walk in through
        Si Zhong’s front gates so casually made Jiang Cheng feel a sense of
        doubt in the school’s management system. How come he had to climb over
        the metal gates to get in when he was late in the morning?
      </p>

      <p>“Let’s start,” Gu Fei said. “Don’t waste time.”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at the four people who made up Bu Shi Hao Niao. There
        was also Li Yan… wait, Li Yan was playing too?
      </p>

      <p>
        “Everyone, this is Liu Fan, Luo Yu, Zhao Yihui, Chen Jie, and Li Yan.”
        Gu Fei pointed at each of them and introduced them without pausing, “If
        you can’t remember, it’s fine. They’re your opponents anyways.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone ran on the court as soon as they took off their jackets. Two of
        the substitute players took the whistle and acted as a referee<a
          href="#_ftn4"
          >[4]</a
        >
        while another one pushed the scoreboard over.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng took a look at the formation and then the opposing
        team, he suddenly felt a long-lost sense of excitement.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll jump the ball,” Gu Fei spoke in a low voice. “Later, don’t lose
        sight of Liu Fan.”
      </p>

      <p>“Liu Fan?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“The one wearing the big metal chain,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng took a glance. It was the first time he saw the “Shi”
        in “Shi Niao”<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> when they were playing.
      </p>

      <p>“Is the chain actually iron?” Guo Xu asked.</p>

      <p>
        “How am I supposed to know? If it’s not iron, then it’s silver and if
        it’s not silver then it’s stainless steel.” Gu Fei looked at him, “How
        about you go ask?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng turned his head away with a smile.</p>

      <p>“No, I won’t. I think it’s stainless steel,” Guo Xu said.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei sighed, “Then don’t lose sight of the Big Stainless-Steel Chain.”
      </p>

      <p>
        It was Liu Fan that jumped the ball with Gu Fei. Liu Fan was slightly
        taller than Gu Fei, but this little bit of height difference could not
        decide anything – it still mainly depended on their reflexes and jumping
        ability.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng stared at the ball.</p>

      <p>
        When the ball was thrown, around the moment when the ball was at the
        highest point with no obvious hint of falling yet, Gu Fei and Liu Fan
        jumped up at the same time. However, the first to touch the ball was Gu
        Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt that it was pretty mind-boggling. Gu Fei somehow
        managed to touch the ball first when simultaneously jumping
        every-single-time.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, even though Gu Fei touched the ball first, and the ball had
        flown in Lu Xiaobin’s direction, it was Li Yan who got hold of the ball
        first. He had slid in from the side the moment Lu Xiaobin’s hand was
        about to touch the ball, taking the ball away with a sweep of his arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was a little shocked. If his memory served him right, last
        time he saw them play Gu Fei had counted Li Yan in as the “old, weak,
        disabled” among the old, weak, and disabled.
      </p>

      <p>
        An “old, weak, and disabled” could steal the ball away that
        effortlessly!
      </p>

      <p>
        Lu Xiaobin was shocked, but then immediately chased after him – snarling
        with his hands outstretched like claws. If it wasn’t due to the strictly
        regulated rules, he looked as if he could grab Li Yan and throw him out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wasn’t in a hurry to give chase. Li Yan wasn’t very fast
        while dribbling, and from the look of it, it didn’t seem like he planned
        on directly bringing it across the court. When he turned his head
        slightly to the right, Jiang Cheng saw Liu Fan, the Big Stainless-Steel
        Chain, reaching out and running toward the right.
      </p>

      <p>
        He hurriedly sped up and rushed forward. When Li Yan passed the ball
        over to Liu Fan, he sped forward even more and intercepted the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, he did not manage to get a hold of the ball. Instead, he
        bounced it toward Lu Xiaobin who was waving his arms.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time, Lu Xiaobin’s reflexes weren’t that bad as he firmly grasped
        the ball.
      </p>

      <p>“Pass it to me!” Jiang Cheng called.</p>

      <p>
        Lu Xiaobin smashed the ball toward Jiang Cheng’s face just as Li Yan was
        coming over to intercept the ball again.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng caught the ball, he wanted to thank God for not letting
        the ball, which was like a shot put<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>, eat his
        face.
      </p>

      <p>Li Yan wanted to block him but was instead blocked by Guo Xu.</p>

      <p>
        The idiotic tactic, of everybody rushing forward to block the moment
        they saw who the ball handler was, was pretty useful this time around.
        Li Yan was relatively thin, and when caught by Guo Xu and Luo Xiaobin,
        you could barely see the guy anymore.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Jiang Cheng brought over the ball to their net, he caught sight of Gu
        Fei, who had managed to shake off the players checking him and was
        running toward the basket at the same time. Gu Fei was also watching
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t hesitate. Good thing he passed the ball over ahead of time –
        the ball bounced from beside Liu Fan’s feet and was firmly caught by Gu
        Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        But an opponent with a level like Bu Shi Hao Niao wasn’t even in the
        same league as the substitutes from the class yesterday. Just as Gu Fei
        got a hold of the ball, another person who he didn’t know was called Luo
        Yu or Zhao Yihui had turned and cut off Gu Fei’s path.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei brought the ball back and Jiang Cheng hurriedly weaved through
        the gaps between people. Who knew if it was because he had too much
        faith in his teammates or if he just had no other option, but without
        even looking back, Gu Fei tossed the ball behind him.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng caught the ball.</p>

      <p>
        Bu Shi Hao Niao must have cooperated for a long time, seeing as how both
        their offence and defence were played extremely well. There was no way
        he could make a shot beneath the basket. After Jiang Cheng got the ball,
        he was directly forced past the three-point line.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fast offence failed; Bu Shi Hao Niao had all returned to the basket.
        Looking at the situation, it was impossible to break in with just him
        and Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he tried to stall time to find an opening, Gu Fei suddenly
        raised his hand. Jiang Cheng saw him raise three fingers.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck.</em></p>

      <p><em>Fine, three-point it is!</em></p>

      <p>
        He rushed forward with the ball, and Liu Fan immediately followed after.
        Stopping at the three-point line, he borrowed the inertia to make a
        jump. Liu Fan jumped after him like a fucking shadow to cap him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had to immediately retract the ball, then single-handedly
        drill it away from the left of Liu Fan’s body.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment he twisted his waist, the wound on his stomach opened up a
        bit. Jiang Cheng couldn’t help but cry out.
      </p>

      <p>It was too fucking impressive.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Liu Fan immediately turned his head when he landed on the
        ground, and as he watched the ball go in, he looked over to Jiang Cheng,
        “That was awesome.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nice shot!” Gu Fei raised his hands above his head and started
        clapping. After meeting Jiang Cheng’s gaze, he raised his thumbs.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Even though Jiang Cheng scored a really cool and difficult ball…
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">And let out such an imposing roar…</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        With Bu Shi Hao Niao and Li Yan having had a long-term cooperation that
        strengthened their abilities—greatly surpassing that of his and Gu
        Fei’s—and skills that were undoubtedly better than the three other
        players on their team, they only scored 15 points during the first half
        of the game.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng scored two three-point shots while Wang Xu got one point
        from a free-throw, and the rest were basically racked up by Gu Fei. With
        Wang Xu’s uncanny looking butt-raising posture that was like an
        elementary school student launching a ball at the hoop with two hands,
        Jiang Cheng was eager to express his surprise when the free-throw
        actually scored.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        During the half-time break, Jiang Cheng eyed the scoreboard – 28:15 –
        that sort of score really brought upon some sorrows. There was no way
        they would be able to catch up with such a gap relying on this level of
        skill and cooperation. If this was a formal competition, they could
        probably only harbor the thought “we can’t let the score gap stretch
        even further” during the next half of the game and then act noble and
        fight forth.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Switch off two players,” Li Yan said while sitting on the ground of the
        basketball court. “Luo Yu, Zhao Yihui, take a break. Switch in two of
        their subs for a rally too, let them all practice.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Good idea,” Captain Wang Xu nodded. “The game can’t go on if they don’t
        switch, I don’t think Class 2 has what it takes, and these trainers are
        so hardcore that even my confidence has shattered to pieces.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng sat to the side in silence. When he went up to the basket
        just now, he had felt his wound aching and once he landed on the ground,
        he didn’t feel much. But after resting for two minutes, the burning
        sensation from his wound eventually settled in.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        He looked over at his enthusiastic teammates, opting to not ask to be
        switched out with a substitute. If he did, they would only have Gu Fei
        to rely on, and without anyone to even cooperate with, there really
        wouldn’t be any reason to even practice.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Besides, Jiang Cheng didn’t want to let Wang Xu know that he was injured
        since he seemed to be ridden with such an immense obsession toward the
        scenario of “you and Hou Zi fought again” that he found it a bit
        intolerable.
      </p>

      <p>“Wanna switch off and rest?” Gu Fei whispered in front of him.</p>

      <p>
        “No need,” Jiang Cheng said as he stood up to stretch out his arm.
        “We’ll see after this game is over.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright,” Gu Fei gave him a glance and then called a few members over.
        “After getting used to the first half, everyone knows what’s coming now,
        right? For the second half, I’ll go up to the basket from the sidelines,
        you guys continue to guard with a man-to-man defense, pass the ball
        frequently, don’t travel too much, they’re all sharp at stealing. Pass
        the ball to Jiang Cheng and I’ll be in charge of scoring.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay, execute according to what Da Fei just said.” Wang Xu, being the
        team captain yet not being able to give out orders, could only
        forcefully jam in a conclusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the first half, Jiang Cheng could feel that Gu Fei was
        restraining himself, almost as if he was experimenting with Wang Xu and
        the others’ skill level. But during the next half, he was significantly
        different from before – like he was frisking about.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only then did Jiang Cheng realize that Gu Fei had surprisingly fast
        transitional speed. Even though Liu Fan and the others were very well
        acquainted with him, they were still not able to guard him on the court.
      </p>

      <p>
        His route was very simple: from within the sidelines, straight to
        beneath the basket, then catch the ball and shoot. If there was someone
        blocking him, he would pass the ball to Jiang Cheng or some other team
        member, and Jiang Cheng would eventually pass the ball back to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        This sort of ball play felt incredibly satisfying but it somewhat
        exhausted Jiang Cheng. He had to be mindful of everyone’s positions on
        the court as well as pay attention to Gu Fei’s unobserving ball passes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The score did catch up by five-six points, but Jiang Cheng couldn’t help
        but say, “Can you take a look to see where I am first before you pass
        the ball?”
      </p>

      <p>“I looked,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        “I was ten steps away and you already fucking passed,” Jiang Cheng
        muttered.
      </p>

      <p>
        “But you got there, didn’t you?” Gu Fei caught on. “The pass didn’t
        miss.”
      </p>

      <p>“… what if it missed?” Jiang Cheng was somewhat speechless.</p>

      <p>“It’s on me then,” Gu Fei answered calmly.</p>

      <p>
        “My ass,” Jiang Cheng shot back. “Is a lost point not lost once it’s
        been counted by you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>,” Gu Fei smiled and gazed at him. “You were
        previously the captain of your school’s basketball team, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What does it have to do with you?” Jiang Cheng looked back at him. “I’m
        just saying you should look around.”
      </p>

      <p>“Got it,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        After Gu Fei said that he got it, there was a slight change. He would
        sweep a glance toward Jiang Cheng from the corner of his eyes to roughly
        approximate his location, but even if that glance was fully carried out,
        he was nonetheless quite methodical – in the sense that ‘since you let
        me see where you are, I’ll look, but how the ball will be passed is how
        it was going to be passed.’
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was already not in the mood to repeat himself. Gu Fei and
        this gang of Bu Shi Hao Niao had the same street basketball demeanor:
        they didn’t have many rules, forced team members to have a 100% tacit
        understanding, and they played ball as if dogs were let loose in the
        park – even the two substitutes they brought along acted as if they had
        been snorting on drugs, ten minutes in and they already counted three
        fouls.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Be mindful,” Jiang Cheng became somewhat helpless. “There’s only so
        many of us, if we all graduate, should Lao Xu play?”
      </p>

      <p>“Nice!” Guo Xu waved his arm as he ran past him.</p>

      <p>
        The game continued, and Jiang Cheng did not care much about the time and
        followed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu intercepted the ball from his opponent’s substitute player and
        then shouted as if God had descended: “Ah——”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng saw that he was holding the ball and immersed in the
        excitement with no intention of passing or going into offense, he had no
        choice but to clap his hands. “Pass the fucking ball!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu returned to his senses and swung his arm, passing the ball over.
      </p>

      <p>
        Suddenly, Jiang Cheng had an illusion that he was about to have a heart
        attack. He had ridden himself of Chen Jie’s entanglement with great
        difficulty, and with no one tailing him at this moment, any normal
        person should know that this ball had to be passed to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Who could have expected that Wang Xu’s swing of the arm was to pass the
        ball to Gu Fei… Gu Fei who was in the midst of an annoying embroilment
        with Liu Fan to the extent that they were almost doing a Lambada
        dance.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a><sup></sup>
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng could only look at this scene dumbfoundedly.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei did not expect Wang Xu to pass the ball to him under such
        circumstances, however, he actually responded quite quickly for being
        busy. He reached out and smacked the ball before Liu Fan could touch it.
      </p>

      <p>
        That smack was akin to a volleyball spike as it changed the trajectory
        of the ball and flew over to Jiang Cheng’s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the fuck!” Jiang Cheng was startled, feeling as though his heart
        was about to jump out of the wound on his rib.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, he raised his hands out of reflex and the ball happened to
        land in… his hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You must all be fucking blind!” He cursed, took the ball and wasn’t in
        the mood to care about anything else as he angrily charged straight
        toward the basket like a tank.
      </p>

      <p>Time was almost up and there was no room to make any adjustments.</p>

      <p>
        After charging toward the basket, he found that there was no opportunity
        for him to shoot. Liu Fan’s tight-knitted, man-to-man defense technique
        was enacted with great proficiency, following him along, with a
        full-body turn that strictly shaded him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not see Gu Fei from the corner of his eyes; there was
        only Wang Xu who was being hunted and Lu Xiaobin. It was impossible for
        him to turn around at this moment since Liu Fan’s hands were swaying
        before his eyes. If he was distracted, the ball would be snatched.
      </p>

      <p>“There’s no time——” someone shouted from the sideline.</p>

      <p>
        If he didn’t shoot, the two points would be gone. Jiang Cheng had no
        other choice and could only surmise that Gu Fei should be coming to
        support him at any moment – if not under the basket, then behind him.
      </p>

      <p>
        So he hooked his hand back and passed the ball backward before
        immediately standing up to Liu Fan, and turning his head around.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stepped forward and received the ball with much steadiness, then
        seamlessly cast a three-point jump – the ball made a long arc in the
        air.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It went in! Fuck!” Wang Xu’s throat-ripping shout rang: “Three-points!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng put his thumbs up. Although this ball didn’t change the
        course of the game at all, it was indeed beautiful.
      </p>

      <p>The whistle sounded, concluding the match.</p>

      <p>
        “Not bad, not bad! I think that it’s pretty good, although the score…”
        Wang Xu wiped the sweat on his forehead and looked over at the
        scoreboard, “Damn, we’re still 11 points behind? Hey, it’s still good
        nonetheless!”
      </p>

      <p>One by one, everyone agreed while wiping their sweat.</p>

      <p>
        “Cooperate a bit more,” Jiang Cheng tugged at his clothes, feeling that
        the slight pain emitting from the wound was probably intensified due to
        the sweat. “Not looking at your teammates or your opponents, and only at
        the ball… this must change.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, that’s right.” Wang Xu nodded and repeated it once more, “Look at
        your teammates and also your opponent, do not look only at the ball.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After the training mission ended, Bu Shi Hao Niao took their leave and a
        bunch of people excitedly discussed it over with Lao Xu.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hurry up, gather your things and change your clothes,” Lao Xu said.
        “I’ve already asked for a ten-minute leave from your politics class so
        don’t disturb the other students when you return to class.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone went to the gymnasium’s washroom to wash their face and take a
        leak.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng waited for everyone to come out before he entered. After he
        washed his face, he lifted his clothes in front of the mirror and looked
        at it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck | your uncle.” He could not help but curse in a whisper when he
        saw blood seeping from the gauze. “Fuck, your, uncle.”
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment, he didn’t have anything to treat the wound and he also
        didn’t want to go to the school doctor either. The doctor would
        certainly report it with just a glance, and if Lao Xu knew, not only
        would he try to use love or something to influence him…
      </p>

      <p>A whistle sounded from behind him.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng immediately pulled down his shirt and looked into the mirror
        to see Gu Fei walking in.
      </p>

      <p>“You have band-aids?” He let out a breath.</p>

      <p>
        “You use band-aids on this sort of wound?” Gu Fei asked. “How about I…
        go over to the school nurse office to get you some bandages.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is that okay?” Jiang Cheng scrunched his eyebrows. “What if the nurse
        asks?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No one will ask if I go,” Gu Fei eyed his wound again. “Why didn’t you
        say your wound was like this yesterday?”
      </p>

      <p>“What’s there to say,” Jiang Cheng answered.</p>

      <p>“Just wait for me a bit,” Gu Fei turned around and walked out.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng held onto the sink and sighed. At first, he was distracted
        during the game so he didn’t feel much pain, but now that he was
        relaxed, he could sense the scorching heat, and in the middle of it all,
        there was a sharp pain shooting up his spine.
      </p>

      <p>
        He carefully peeled the gauze and took a look; it was slightly red with
        some blood seeping out, but it looked fine.
      </p>

      <p>
        It had been a long time since he saw a wound as bloody as this. Since
        starting high school, he did get into a few fights, but most of the time
        they only left some bruises on his body. Seeing this sort of bloody
        wound on himself was pretty depressing.
      </p>

      <p>Could this be considered to be for Li Baoguo?</p>

      <p>
        Forget it, whatever condition Li Baoguo was currently in, he was
        disinclined to go and ask.
      </p>

      <p>
        What was concerning was that from yesterday till now, Li Baoguo wasn’t
        ever with him. Whether he went gambling again or was beaten up by that
        bunch again, he didn’t know.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thinking more carefully about it, he started panicking a little. What
        could Li Baoguo possibly be doing? Was this problem solved or not? Would
        there be more problems arising in the future?
      </p>

      <p>
        This time, he had gotten beaten up on the streets, next time would
        people come knocking at their door?
      </p>

      <p>
        Would they smash everything into smithereens or hit them till their
        heads broke and bled?
      </p>

      <p>Thinking about it made his body go cold.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei returned incredibly quick, entering the bathroom with a plastic
        bag in hand. The inside contained iodine, gauze, elastic tape and the
        like.
      </p>

      <p>“Should I help you?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I’ll… do it myself.” Jiang Cheng took some cotton pads and poured some
        iodine on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ever since he learned that his interest in men was greater than that
        toward girls, he wasn’t very willing to have any physical contact with
        anybody. Except for Pan Zhi, if anybody touched him, he would be
        uncomfortable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Especially somebody like Gu Fei who didn’t look bad – his hands were
        rather pretty too. He was always worried that he would start thinking
        about unnecessary things.
      </p>

      <p>
        But trying to lift your clothes with one hand while swabbing at your
        wound with the other was not very easy to manage. If he loosened his
        hand when changing a cotton pad, then his clothes would slide down and
        touch the wound.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wang Xu said that you’re troublesome,” Gu Fei stated as he watched from
        the side.
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng sounded. “What, do you want to give him a like?”</p>

      <p>
        “Yeah, you’re really quite <em>troublesome</em>,” Gu Fei said. “Are you
        trying to show that you can keep going without rest?”<a href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sighed, he held the iodine bottle and glanced at him. “I’m
        afraid that you are reckless with your hands sinceyou’re pretty reckless
        when you play.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I started treating my own wounds when I was four years old.” Gu Fei
        took a hold of the bottle in his hand, pouring on the cotton pad as he
        spoke, “It’s familiar work now.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything.</p>

      <p><em>Four years old?</em></p>

      <p>
        No way, he couldn’t even remember anything from when he was four years
        old.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, Gu Fei’s actions really were well-practiced. The contact of the
        cotton pad touching the wound was very light and very fast, he barely
        felt any pain and it was already over.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng moved his gaze to the faucet beside him.</p>

      <p>
        “This wound won’t heal by the time of the tournament.” Gu Fei placed the
        gauze over the wound, “Press on it a bit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It shouldn’t be much of an impact.” Jiang Cheng pressed down on the
        gauze and quickly stole a glance at Gu Fei’s fingers. Gu Fei’s fingers
        were really long, especially the pinky, and were really suitable for
        playing the piano… he continued to stare at the faucet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei quickly fixed the gauze in place with the elastic tape. “It’s
        good now. Just take these with you, so you can change them yourself.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When they returned to the classroom, the politics teacher was in the
        middle of raging at the podium.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yet the noises in the classroom weren’t suppressed by her rage. The
        ‘basketball team’ had just finished a game – this was precisely the time
        for nonstop excitement.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your Xu Zong can’t tell what’s more important!” The politics teacher
        slapped at the podium, “I see that none of you plan on having any marks
        for your midterms! You all might as well get tested on basketball
        instead! Actually using my class time to go play basketball! It’s not
        that I look down on your class, it’s your class being like this that…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng lowered his head and quickly sat down in his own seat. For a
        xueba like him, he would generally give the teacher some face; if the
        teacher was angry and scolded him, he would display a more well-behaved
        demeanor.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Gu Fei wasn’t that cooperative; amidst the teacher’s scolding, he
        very slowly went to his seat and even properly arranged his jacket
        before sitting down.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey, Da Fei,” Zhou Jing leaned to the side and whispered, “Hey, Da…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Before he could finish, the politics teacher turned and slapped the
        podium hard: “Zhou Jing! Get out!!”
      </p>

      <p>“Huh?” Zhou Jing was shocked.</p>

      <p>“Get out!” The teacher pointed at him and continued to shout.</p>

      <p>
        Zhou Jing hesitated for a moment, but still stood up and put on his
        jacket, then walked out to the corridor from the back door.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The two in the back! You can also get out!” The teacher pointed at
        Jiang Cheng and Gu Fei, “The others came back, but you were the slowest!
        From the way I see it, you don’t want to attend class! If you don’t want
        to attend class, then just go stand outside!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at the teacher. Although he had been inattentive and
        absent from class, this was the first time ever that a teacher pointed
        at his nose and kicked him out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was very obedient, much more obedient than when the teacher told
        him to attend classes and pay attention. As soon as the teacher finished
        speaking, he nonchalantly stood up, grabbed his jacket, walked out, then
        leaned against the railings in the corridor with Zhou Jing.
      </p>

      <p>“You!” The teacher continued to point at Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sighed with some speechlessness and got up to leave. He
        didn’t have to grab his clothes, since there wasn’t even time for him to
        take off his jacket.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I heard Wang Xu say that you guys are really awesome now?” Zhou Jing
        did not feel depressed at all from getting kicked out of the classroom.
        He splayed across the railings and continued his previous question.
      </p>

      <p>“Awesome, my ass.” Jiang Cheng snorted.</p>

      <p>
        Captain Wang Jiuri demanded that everybody act like hopeless players,
        yet he himself couldn’t hold back and started bragging.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is Da Fei going on the court?” Zhou Jing asked, “Wang Xu said Lao Xu
        ordered you and you didn’t even give an answer.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng almost couldn’t hold back the truth upon hearing this. As it
        turns out, Wang Xu was still holding onto the setting of Gu Fei not
        playing, but he was needlessly adding so much drama that it really made
        people want to interrogate him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah,” Gu Fei turned his head. “I am a person without any collective
        sense of honour.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was standing at Jiang Cheng’s right side. When he turned his
        head, his breath brushed past his face. He hastily dodged to the side,
        bounced two times from where he stood, subtly went around Zhou Jing, and
        leaned against the railing and looked down at the floor beneath them.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Really?” Zhou Jing looked at Jiang Cheng with some suspicion, “You’re
        not lying to me?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at him; Zhou Jing wasn’t a bad person, but you could
        tell at a glance that he was the gossipy type of person. If you said
        anything to him then you wouldn’t even need to do anything for the news
        to spread.
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “But Wang Xu said that you guys are really awesome now… how is that
        possible, it’s not like I haven’t seen them play before.” Zhou Jing
        frowned. After thinking for a while, his eyes lit up, “Fuck, is this
        your battle tactic? Telling people that you’re really awesome!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though Jiang Cheng really wanted to ask him what bragging about how
        awesome they were to intimidate the opponent could possibly achieve, he
        still nodded his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah…” Zhou Jing still wanted to say something, but Gu Fei’s phone
        sounded, interrupting his words.
      </p>

      <p>The call was from his mother. Gu Fei picked up the phone, “Hello?”</p>

      <p>
        “Have you been dismissed from school yet?!” His mother’s anxious voice
        rang out, “I don’t know what Er Miao…”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei heard Gu Miao’s screams, his heart lurched. “I’ll be back
        immediately.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Once he hung up the phone, he immediately turned and ran down the
        stairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were several reasons that could cause Gu Miao’s screaming. In the
        past two years, it was usually because of water, but it was not definite
        that she would have a reaction to that. It was only occasionally, plus
        their mother knew, so she would usually watch out for that.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao’s reaction now should not have anything to do with water, so
        what could it be this time?
      </p>

      <p>
        He rushed out of the school gates; the security guards wanted to hold
        him back and question him, but they didn’t even get the chance to reach
        out their hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he got on the bike to rush back home, Gu Fei felt incredibly
        exhausted. This sort of feeling would always suddenly rise up every
        single time. For a moment, he felt like if he closed his eyes, he could
        sleep until he grew old.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t feel the tiredness in his body. He never really felt tired
        anymore – only the weariness in his heart was something he couldn’t get
        rid of. He could care less about his mother. He could yell at her a few
        times to vent, but he couldn’t do that to Gu Miao.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was always careful about her; on one hand, he allowed Gu Miao to
        fight against all sorts of harmful things that could possibly appear on
        her own. On the other hand, he also had to constantly protect her in
        case any accidents that would suddenly appear.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he ran up the stairs, he could hear Gu Miao screaming from behind the
        door.
      </p>

      <p>
        The old lady across from them opened the door, looking at him with a
        face full of concern, “Is Er Miao…”
      </p>

      <p>“Everything is fine.” Gu Fei opened the door and entered the house.</p>

      <p>
        His mom was currently holding Gu Miao as she was seated on the sofa. Gu
        Miao had her face buried in her chest and was screaming non-stop.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Er Miao, Er Miao, don’t cry anymore. Look, your brother is back,” their
        mother patted Gu Miao on the back. “Gu Fei is back…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei went over and picked up Gu Miao from their mother’s embrace; one
        hand rubbed her back and the other gently squeezed the back of her neck,
        “It’s alright now. Er Miao, it’s alright now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao held onto his neck, still screaming and her body trembling a
        bit.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei frowned. Gu Miao wasn’t scared, but angry.</p>

      <p>
        “What happened?” Gu Fei asked lightly, “Tell your brother, why are you
        angry?”
      </p>

      <p>“Angry?” Their mother looked at him with some confusion.</p>

      <p>
        He pointed at Gu Miao’s backpack and their mother brought the backpack
        over to his side. He took out Gu Miao’s books and notebooks, shuffling
        through them as he asked, “Is it the books? Or the notebooks? Did
        someone tear your books?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao’s screams lowered in volume, but she was still screaming. A word
        got mixed up in the middle, “Drawing.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei opened her character book. He didn’t flip past two pages before
        he saw that one of the pages was messily scribbled all over in a red
        pen. There was a small wrestling person with what you could tell was a
        skateboard drawn beside it, and there were even words to go with it on
        either side.
      </p>

      <p>Pig, mute, idiot…</p>

      <p>
        “Er Miao, stop.” Gu Fei put down the book and grasped Gu Miao’s
        shoulder, “Look at me. Look at me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao’s screaming finally stopped. She raised her head and looked at
        him, her eyes opened wide.
      </p>

      <p>“Do you know who it is?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>Gu Miao nodded her head.</p>

      <p>
        “This matter,” Gu Fei looked into her eyes, “Brother will help you deal
        with it, okay? Brother will go find this classmate and have a talk with
        them.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao stared at him for a long while, then shook her head.</p>

      <p>“You don’t want me to?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>Gu Miao continued to shake her head.</p>

      <p>“Then what do you want to do?” Gu Fei asked, “Tell your brother.”</p>

      <p>
        After a long period of time, Gu Miao only lightly said one line,
        “Myself.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t know how she planned on dealing with this matter, but no
        matter how he asked, Gu Miao wouldn’t speak anymore. She didn’t give him
        any more answers. She turned to enter her room and shut the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why is my life so…” His mom covered her face and sat on the sofa to
        quietly cry, “I married a bastard, can’t even take care of my own child…
        did I do something bad in my last life… is wanting to find another
        significant other againalso…”
      </p>

      <p>“Mom, go back to your room first,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “My son is also so harsh to me…” His mother covered her face as she
        cried while entering her room.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei squeezed the area between his brows.</p>

      <p>The house was silent, there wasn’t a single sound.</p>

      <p>
        He discretely took a look at Gu Miao from a crack at the door and saw Gu
        Miao holding a blanket and lying on it, seemingly asleep, and their
        mother’s side was also silent.
      </p>

      <p>He sat on the sofa and closed his eyes.</p>

      <p>
        After resting for around half an hour, he opened his eyes, took out his
        phone, and gave a call to Ding Zhuxin. “Xin-<em>jie</em>, do you have
        some time at night to come around?”
      </p>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p></p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei suddenly disappeared during politics class without even grabbing
        his bag. Their politics teacher was so infuriated that she rushed to the
        teacher’s office and started yelling at the top of her lungs at Lao Xu
        who, inadvertently, came to the classroom after school was over.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng.” He blocked Jiang Cheng, who was just about to leave with
        his bag.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know,” Jiang Cheng replied, knowing full well that Lao Xu
        wanted to ask him about Gu Fei, but he honestly knew nothing of the
        matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        “There has to be a reason for him to suddenly run off,” Lao Xu stated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng only knew that Gu Fei had picked up a call and said that he
        would return immediately, but he didn’t hear anything else after that.
      </p>

      <p>
        But. He didn’t want to tell Lao Xu that portion. Who knew what was going
        on with Gu Fei or whether or not he was willing to let Lao Xu know – he
        didn’t want to shoot his mouth off.
      </p>

      <p>
        But clearly, Zhou Jing did not put in as much consideration as he did.
        When Lao Xu turned to ask him next, he commented without a thought: “He
        picked up a phone call and said he was going home, then ran off. Maybe
        something came up at home?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Really,” Lao Xu frowned. After Zhou Jing left, he grabbed onto Jiang
        Cheng once more. “Even Zhou Jing knows, yet you don’t?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Does it matter whether I know or not? Don’t you already know now?”
        Jiang Cheng took his bag and walked outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Can you help bring Gu Fei’s bag back to him?” Lao Xu called out from
        behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No.” Jiang Cheng looked back, “Xu Zong, if I ever ran off halfway
        through school without taking my bag, don’t you even dare think of
        getting someone to help bring it back to me.”
      </p>

      <p>“Why?” Lao Xu asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Because it is incredibly annoying,” Jiang Cheng replied. “Not everybody
        is willing to have someone touch their things, nevermind bringing it to
        their home. Really, if he wanted to take it, then he would’ve come to
        get it himself. The school can even let in a bunch of hooligans, do you
        think they’ll be afraid of letting in their own students?”
      </p>

      <p>Lao Xu stared at him, as if he couldn’t properly respond.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything else either as he turned around and
        left.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu was like an old mother – caring too much. But what people this
        age did not need the most was precisely this type of pampering love from
        a mother hen-like person.
      </p>

      <p>
        Especially Gu Fei who—you could tell at a glance—was already used to
        being alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng believed that Lao Xu would definitely give Gu Fei a call
        later, but Gu Fei most certainly wouldn’t answer him. This type of
        teacher-student relationship truthfully could not be improved with Lao
        Xu’s current level of EQ.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thinking of this aspect, Jiang Cheng suddenly found himself missing his
        former homeroom teacher.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as the memories started to flood in, he immediately raised his head
        and inhaled a breath of cold air, quickly cutting off the memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        At lunch, he honestly wanted to go eat stuffed flatbread at Wang Jiuri’s
        place but felt that if he went by himself and saw Captain Jiuri, he
        wouldn’t be able to find anything to say. He also didn’t want Captain
        Jiuri to keep pulling at him to excitedly discuss tactics.
      </p>

      <p>
        So in the end, he ate a bowl of noodles at a small shop at the junction
        of the street.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he returned to Li Baoguo’s place, he was a little surprised to find
        that Li Baoguo was actually at home. He was sitting on the couch smoking
        with a newspaper in his hand, reading in the dim light.
      </p>

      <p>
        This place of Li Baoguo’s was sandwiched between two buildings at the
        front and back, and its structure was even shaped like the 凹 character.
        The lighting was so incredibly poor that even when the sunlight outside
        was shining brightly, ever so brightly, it still seemed as though it was
        dusk when one entered the place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng immediately felt oppressed every time he walked in. He
        reached out to turn on the living room light.
      </p>

      <p>“Yo!” Li Baoguo looked up in surprise, “Cheng Cheng is back?”</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng glanced at him; his face was blue and purple, and the
        corners of his mouth were still swollen, easily revealing the outcome of
        yesterday’s event —he certainly wasn’t beaten lightly. Had he not headed
        over, Li Baoguo most likely would have been sent to the hospital on a
        stretcher. “Is… your wound okay?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s fine, it’s fine.” Li Baoguo rubbed his face, “This little injury
        is nothing. Back when I was younger, working in the factory, youngsters
        like them weren’t even enough for one of my hands…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I already ate.” Jiang Cheng interrupted him and entered his room, “You
        can eat something by yourself.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as Jiang Cheng took off his coat, wanting to lay in bed for a
        while, the door was nonchalantly pushed open.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng Cheng,” Li Baoguo half-leaned into the room, “Did anything happen
        to you yesterday?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt a little helpless. He didn’t have a habit of locking
        the door because since he was young, as long as he closed it, there
        wasn’t anyone who would just casually open his bedroom door. It seemed
        he needed to remember to lock the door now.
      </p>

      <p>“I’m fine,” Jiang Cheng replied. “I want to sleep for a bit.”</p>

      <p>
        “Your dad is useless,” Li Baoguo said, having no intention of closing
        the door and leaving. “Your dad was getting beaten up on the streets and
        even needed you to come save him. You must be feeling embarrassed,
        right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t reply. When the words “your dad” left Li Baoguo’s
        mouth, he initially didn’t even remember that “your dad” was referring
        to Li Baoguo himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        “But you can rest assured,” Li Baoguo continued. “If your dad has any
        problems, I won’t drag you into any of them!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, I know.” Jiang Cheng continued to be patient, “I’m going to sleep a
        bit. I’m a little tired.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo nodded, then turned around and left, but still managed to not
        close the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had to go over and close the door again. He hesitated for a
        moment, and eventually kept the door unlocked. Li Baoguo was still on
        the other side, and he could hear the sound of the door locking. Jiang
        Cheng didn’t want to make things too awkward.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he lied down on the bed, he only felt exhausted. He didn’t know
        whether it was because he was playing basketball with an injury or
        because he didn’t sleep well last night.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo didn’t go gambling today for once, hence, Jiang Cheng could
        hear him coughing in the living room throughout the entirety of noon. He
        had considered on multiple occasions if he should get him to go to the
        hospital to check and see if it was pharyngitis, seeing as how from the
        start of winter break all the way till midterms now, Li Baoguo’s cough
        had never gotten better.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was impossible to take an afternoon nap while hearing a sound like
        this. To add to that, the neighbors’ upstairs were hitting their child
        again; not the household from yesterday, but another one. There were
        many households with children in this building, and all of them hit
        their children every day. Today it was your household, tomorrow it will
        be mine, and if we caught up to one another, then we can hit them all
        together.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the children gave heartrending cries; but if in the middle of the
        ordeal a neighbor could not bear it any longer and went to try and
        appease them, they would be yelled at too. If they couldn’t endure being
        yelled at then a vicious battle of words would surely ensue.
      </p>

      <p>
        In short, the old buildings in this area were incredibly lively every
        day, brimming with a sense of liveliness that Jiang Cheng had never been
        in contact with before.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sound of Li Baoguo’s coughing finally disappeared along with the
        sound of the living room door. Jiang Cheng felt for his phone and took a
        look, then also got out of bed and left for school.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t come to school in the afternoon either.</p>

      <p>
        Since school started, if Gu Fei wasn’t late then he was absent. It
        seemed to be the norm; the students weren’t curious, and the teachers
        never asked.
      </p>

      <p>Only Lao Xu would keep on asking.</p>

      <p>
        When school ended in the afternoon, Jiang Cheng was blocked by Lao Xu
        again.<br />“Jiang Cheng, are you that unwilling to communicate with
        your teacher?” Lao Xu’s body carried a faint smell of alcohol.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng also discovered in this period of time that although Lao Xu
        wouldn’t get drunk, his body would always carry a faint smell of
        alcohol. Zhou Jing had said that he would drink two mouthfuls even when
        he ate breakfast.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was also because of this that he was called out and yelled at in
        front of the whole school by the principal, though even then he never
        changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just on this aspect alone, he’s pretty Jianghu<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a
        >,” Zhou Jing had said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t know if it was because of this that Lao Xu especially
        liked Li Bai.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> He would always go off-topic in
        class; no matter what the text was about, he could always manage to
        relate it to Li Bai.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Speaking of xx, I want to mention Li Bai,” he would often start like
        that. “Li Bai, that old fellow…”
      </p>

      <p>“Did you drink?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I drank a little bit at lunch.” Lao Xu laughed, “Jiang Cheng, I saw
        that when you were playing basketball, you and Gu Fei cooperated really
        well. Normally, your relationship shouldn’t be too bad, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… it’s just playing basketball. Anybody who knows how to play would
        know how to cooperate,” Jiang Cheng answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I called Gu Fei a couple times in the afternoon, but he never picked
        up,” Lao Xu said. “I didn’t care enough about him before…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng helplessly interrupted him, “Enough, I get it. I’ll head
        over to his shop to take a look when school is over, I can’t do much
        else. We actually aren’t very familiar with each other, plus, I don’t
        even know where his house is.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fine, fine, fine.” Lao Xu happily nodded his head, “Tell him to come to
        school tomorrow… actually, I originally wanted to send Wang Xu, but he
        doesn’t live as close as you. Plus, that little bastard isn’t reliable…”
      </p>

      <p>“Got it,” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p>
        Going to Gu Fei’s shop for a look wasn’t a big deal, but if it wasn’t
        for the fact that Lao Xu kept on pestering him endlessly, he would never
        have gone. Who would be happy if they were constantly bugged by their
        teachers and classmates, and even had someone go to their house just to
        check up on them?
      </p>

      <p>
        He made his way outside of school, staring at the route board when he
        got to the bus stop.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wound was torn open once today; if the training continued on like
        this for the following days, then his wound wouldn’t even recover by the
        time the competition started. He wanted to get some adhesive or
        something like that when he went to the hospital to switch medication;
        something that would help it get better a bit quicker.
      </p>

      <p>
        This bus stop had a couple of buses that could take you directly to
        somewhere nearby the hospital. He didn’t have to wait for more than a
        few minutes before a bus arrived.
      </p>

      <p>
        He got on the bus —crowded completely by the students of Si Zhong; an
        empty bus got filled by a half just by passing through this station. The
        next stop was some vocational college, and once past these two stations
        the bus wouldn’t be able to board any more people.
      </p>

      <p>The bus was full of laughing and chatting students.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was squeezed at the metal bar next to the backdoor. If the
        person behind him moved, he would knock into the iron bar. It wasn’t
        even two stops before he was so annoyed that he wanted to shove all the
        people beside him onto the floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        They were passing by another school up ahead. Jiang Cheng took a look;
        thank God it was an elementary school. Elementary students all had
        somebody to pick them up, thus, there wouldn’t be any more bodies
        squeezed into the bus. Besides, by this time, elementary students should
        have finished school a long time ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        He pressed his head against the metal bar, and with his earphones in his
        backpack, it was practically impossible to pull them out now. He could
        only close his eyes and rest his mind while listening to the student of
        Si Zhong bragging or gossiping.
      </p>

      <p>
        Halfway past the station, he heard a commotion in the back of the bus
        and opened his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>“Yo! Elementary students are so fierce nowadays!” somebody said.</p>

      <p>
        “Aiyo, that punch is gonna break skin!” another person said happily on
        the side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took a glance outside the window and was momentarily
        stunned.
      </p>

      <p>
        Three little boys were screaming and swearing while running and chasing
        after them was a skateboard-holding… girl.
      </p>

      <p>
        This skateboard-holding girl, Jiang Cheng didn’t even need to look
        closely to know that it was Gu Miao.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao chased them for a few steps, but since the little boys ran fast,
        she couldn’t catch up. She put the skateboard on the ground, stepped a
        few times and dashed ahead just like that.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she passed by the bus, Jiang Cheng saw a look of coldness or anger
        that he had never seen appear on her face before. For a moment, his
        heart ached a bit.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bus drove slowly; the good thing was there wasn’t much distance left
        of the road till the next stop. The hospital was still three stops away,
        but Jiang Cheng frantically got off the bus in a hurry.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao and the three little boys were already gone. He gave chase in
        the direction that the children disappeared in with rushed steps and
        stopped at a forked road. Continuing forward was the main road and
        turning to the right was a small dilapidated street.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he wondered which direction he should go in; he heard a scream
        coming from the right side.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment he turned his head, he saw only two out of the three little
        boys scurrying out of an alley. Who knew how the third one ended up
        fallen on the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then there was Gu Miao, who was currently sitting on top of him,
        smashing his head with the skateboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Jiang Cheng was so shocked that his legs went a little soft. He
        immediately sprinted in their direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the people from the neighboring stores came out; they all cried in
        shock at first, then somebody wanted to go over and pull Gu Miao away,
        but as soon as somebody came near, Gu Miao would swing her skateboard
        toward them —not even a group of two people could approach her.
      </p>

      <p>
        The boy being pressed to the ground wasn’t even struggling anymore as he
        simply held his head, crying and wailing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao took the chance to smash his head again with the skateboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time a man grabbed Gu Miao from behind and quickly hoisted her up.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao started to struggle frantically and made a sharp scream.</p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng ran over, the man was at a bit of a loss. He couldn’t
        toss her aside, but he also couldn’t keep on holding her either.
      </p>

      <p>“Gu Miao!” Jiang Cheng shouted as he sprinted over.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao was closing her eyes as if she couldn’t hear anything; she only
        continued to scream, grasping onto a corner of her skateboard without
        loosening her grip.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Er Miao!” Jiang Cheng shouted, “It’s Jiang Cheng-<em>gege</em>! It’s
        Cheng-<em>ge</em>!”<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        “You know her?” somebody asked. “What’s wrong with this kid? Has she
        gone mad?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took a glance at the boy who was helped up from the ground.
        He saw that there was blood on his head, and the boy was currently
        crying his heart out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Give her,” Jiang Cheng said to the man holding Gu Miao. “Give her to
        me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can’t leave! Is this your family’s child?!” the man shouted. “Look
        at how much she beat the other kid! This must be reported to the police,
        tell your family…”
      </p>

      <p>“I said give her to me!” Jiang Cheng roared, glaring at the man.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao struggled and screamed like her life depended on it in a way he
        had never seen before, appearing both mad and heartrending. Jiang Cheng
        knew that Gu Miao had some issues, and now that she was like this, he
        suddenly grew anxious.
      </p>

      <p>The man was stunned into place by his roar.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng went over and embraced Gu Miao, snatching her into his own
        arms.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can’t leave!” The crowd of onlookers grew bigger; everybody formed
        a circle to entrap him and Gu Miao in the middle.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You guys go call the police.” Jiang Cheng held tightly onto Gu Miao,
        who had already quieted-down screaming, but was still trembling all over
        non-stop.
      </p>

      <p>
        The injury on the little boy’s head wasn’t too serious. A woman took
        some iodine and came over to clean his head. There was a small wound at
        the back of his head, but he didn’t know if there would be any other
        problems.
      </p>

      <p>Somebody called the police.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng hugged Gu Miao tighter, firmly rubbing her back to comfort
        her, while pulling out his phone and dialing Gu Fei’s number.
      </p>

      <p>But it didn’t even sound for half a ring before it was cut off.</p>

      <p>That bastard had set it to do not disturb!</p>

      <p>He could only send Gu Fei another message.</p>

      <p>– Gu Miao is in trouble, reply to me ASAP.</p>

      <p>Then he immediately dialled Wang Xu’s number.</p>

      <p>
        “Yo?” Wang Xu on the other hand picked up the phone really quickly,
        “Jiang Cheng? A troublemaker like you actually gave me a call?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go find Gu Fei immediately.” Jiang Cheng lowered his voice, “Hurry
        immediately! He’s not picking up his phone!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah?” Wang Xu was surprised, but it could still be heard that he had
        started running, “Hold on, I just got home, I’m going to head out again!
        I’ll go over and find him! Where are you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know. Right now we’re at an elementary school… but I don’t know
        where we’ll be after the police arrive in a minute.” Jiang Cheng looked
        around at the angry and shocked people surrounding them. He felt that if
        he didn’t protect her, Gu Miao would be beaten at any given moment.
      </p>

      <p>“I got it!” Wang Xu shouted and hung up the phone.</p>

      <p>
        The police came very quickly. The moment they arrived at the scene, they
        were surrounded by the crowd and the pell-mell of explanations
        transpired.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Bring this child to the hospital first,” an old policeman said. He then
        looked at Jiang Cheng, “Are you this child’s family?”
      </p>

      <p>“No,” Jiang Cheng answered. “I am her brother’s classmate.”</p>

      <p>
        “Notify her family,” the old policeman said. “First follow us to the
        hospital, then we’ll head over to the police station.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright.” Jiang Cheng held onto Gu Miao, went over to pick up the
        skateboard, and then walked over to the police car.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao had already grown silent, and simply hugged his neck tightly.
        Her fingers were tightly grasping onto the back of his neck; it felt
        like her nails could pierce his flesh.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Miao? Gu Miao?” Jiang Cheng spoke lightly, “You’re going to tear my
        skin apart. It’s okay now, don’t be afraid, your brother will be here
        soon.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao didn’t have any reactions and her hands didn’t loosen, though
        her body was still trembling.
      </p>

      <p>
        This sort of situation made Jiang Cheng extremely worried. One, he
        didn’t know what was wrong with her right now —why would she beat the
        other kid up so badly? Two, he wasn’t Gu Miao’s relative after all; he
        didn’t know if he was handling the situation correctly… if he didn’t
        handle it correctly, would Gu Fei come find him for revenge…?
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng first paid for the hospital fees. Treating the wound and all
        sorts of check-ups didn’t cost much money, what was bothersome was the
        other kid’s parents.
      </p>

      <p>
        The kid’s parents rushed over to hit Gu Miao and Jiang Cheng as if they
        had gone mad the moment they arrived at the hospital. When the police
        came over to block them, they almost beat the police along with them.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t block me!” the man shouted. “Pay up! Pay up! How she beat up my
        son is how I’m going to beat her! That psycho! That freak!<a
          href="#_ftn4"
          >[4]</a
        >
        Let me tell you, I know who this crazy bitch is, she is my son’s
        classmate! Freak! If the class has her, then there’s bound to be
        trouble! If you have any sense, then don’t let her out of the house! I
        will hit her every time I see her!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How this situation will be handled is something the police decides.”
        Jiang Cheng knew that Gu Miao was definitely in the wrong regarding this
        matter, but the other person’s words were really too anger-inducing. He
        pressed down the anger that was on the verge of igniting, “If you hit
        her, then I will hit you, this will never be finished.”
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck!” the woman screamed. “Police! Listen to the words he said!”</p>

      <p>Gu Fei finally called, “Where are you? I’ll arrive immediately.”</p>

      <p>“The hospital, hurry,” Jiang Cheng answered.</p>

      <p>
        Once the parents heard that a parent was going to come over, they
        suddenly grew agitated again. When Gu Fei arrived, the police were just
        about to take them to the police station.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What is the meaning of this?!” the man started screaming the moment he
        saw Gu Fei, “Are you looking for a fight!?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Following behind Gu Fei was Li Yan and Liu Fan, as well as Wang Xu and
        Ding Zhuxin.
      </p>

      <p>“Gu Miao, your brother is here,” Jiang Cheng whispered to Gu Miao.</p>

      <p>“Er Miao?” Gu Fei half-ran over.</p>

      <p>
        When Gu Miao heard his voice, she finally loosened her hold on Jiang
        Cheng’s neck, turned to take a look at him, and then rushed into his
        arms, holding onto him tightly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “She beat up the other kid,” Jiang Cheng explained in a quiet voice.
        “Used the skateboard to smash his head.”
      </p>

      <p>“I’m sorry,” Gu Fei turned to look at the two people, “My sister…”</p>

      <p>
        “Sorry, my ass! Sorry, don’t do shit!” the woman immediately pointed at
        him, “If I don’t beat her then this matter won’t be finished!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at her silently, then after a few seconds he said: “Come.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The woman seemed to have been given a fright as she backed away two
        steps, “My God! What sort of attitude is this? What sort of attitude is
        this?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s head to the police station first,” Ding Zhuxin walked over.
        “Listen to what the police have to say. How this matter should be
        handled, treatment, and compensation, as long as it’s reasonable then we
        will cooperate.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You…” the woman wanted to continue to say something else but was
        stopped by Ding Zhuxin.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da-jie.”<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> Ding Zhuxin stared at her, “You’re
        making such a big fuss that the police can’t even say a word. If you
        don’t want to settle this matter through proper methods, we can also
        <em>cooperate</em>. If that’s the case, then you won’t be able to get
        anything good out of this.”
      </p>

      <p>“Watch what you say,” the police warned Ding Zhuxin.</p>

      <p>
        “Apologies,” Ding Zhuxin smiled apologetically to the police. “With the
        children getting into trouble, we’re all bound to be anxious. We’re
        certainly willing to cooperate, but cooperation can’t only rely on one
        side, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The police took the bunch of people back to the police station. Gu Fei
        asked, “My classmate doesn’t have to come, right?”
      </p>

      <p>“He also has to come,” the police said and glanced at Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng sounded. He looked at Gu Miao, who was on Gu Fei’s
        back; now she appeared a lot calmer, no longer having the madness and
        cold anger from before.
      </p>

      <p>“Thank you.” Gu Fei gazed at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t say anything now,” Jiang Cheng said. “Gu Miao… is she alright?
        Just now, I saw that she was…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “She’s fine.” Gu Fei hesitated for a moment, “I’ll find a time to
        explain it to you slowly.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng sounded in answer and followed the police outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        He only walked a few steps before Gu Fei called him from behind, “Jiang
        Cheng.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You…” Gu Fei motioned to the back of his neck, reaching out to tug at
        his shirt collar, “The skin here is torn.”
      </p>

      <p>
        It was probably from Gu Miao’s grasp. The little girl’s strength was
        quite tremendous.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Jiang Cheng didn’t think anything of such a matter; Gu Fei’s
        movement when he tugged at his shirt collar made him reflexively slap Gu
        Fei’s hand.
      </p>

      <p>“…it’s fine,” Jiang Cheng replied somewhat awkwardly.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        After spending almost two hours at the local police station, the matter
        was finally dealt with.
      </p>

      <p>
        The beaten boy did not admit that he had provoked Gu Miao and only said
        that she chased and struck him without reason at all. Gu Miao remained
        silent as she lay on Gu Fei’s shoulder with her eyes closed, which made
        it difficult for this accusation to be confirmed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng, for one, did not believe the kid’s words; with Gu Miao’s
        condition, she would be bullied no matter which school she was placed
        in.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the focus of this incident was not the reason for Gu Miao’s
        action, and even if the boy had bullied her, there was not much the
        officer could have done; the focus was that Gu Miao had smashed his
        head, resulting in two stitches.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, there were no other serious matters. And when the parent
        pressed for compensation – one that was simply daylight robbery<a
          href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
        – Ding Zhuxin pressed back in a semi-reasonably, semi-threatening
        demeanor; midway through, the officer had even warned her several times
        to watch her words.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei hadn’t spoken much, and his attention was only on Gu Miao.</p>

      <p>
        Li Yan, and the others, took on the job of folding their arms and
        looking hard, a look that perfectly matched Ding Zhuxin’s
        threat—displaying an aura of “if you dare to act recklessly, we will
        definitely be reckless as well; look at us, we don’t look like good
        people anyways.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, when the arrangement was finalized and the officer let them go,
        Jiang Cheng let out a long sigh of relief.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment, his stomach woke up and cried out in starvation – though
        he didn’t have an appetite for any food whatsoever.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they walked out of the station, it was the rather cold and cutting
        wind that greeted them.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You guys should go back. It’s been hard on you all.” Gu Fei glanced at
        Jiang Cheng, “We can just call for a taxi and go with Wang Xu.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay,” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p>
        After they split with the others and got into the taxi, no one uttered a
        word. Jiang Cheng was a bit gloomy and reckoned that Gu Fei was also not
        in any mood to speak, and Wang Xu didn’t so much as mention the
        basketball game, though he cursed and sighed heavily, only suppressing
        his voice immediately when Gu Fei glanced at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You guys haven’t eaten yet, right?” Gu Fei asked as the taxi approached
        the street.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t worry about us, just hurry up and go back,” Wang Xu said. “And
        there’s no need to have the taxi turn around, I’ll get off here since my
        house is just around the corner… Jiang Cheng, are you coming over to eat
        stuffed flatbreads?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Forget it. I don’t want to eat anything right now,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once they arrived at the crossroad, Gu Fei carried Gu Miao out of the
        taxi while Jiang Cheng held onto Gu Miao’s skateboard. After they walked
        for a few steps, Gu Fei turned: “Thanks for today.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s no need to say that.” Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Miao. “Have her
        ask for two days of leave. I saw three little boys earlier today, and
        those two didn’t take a beating. I’m not sure…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Even if she doesn’t ask for leave, it doesn’t necessarily mean she can
        still return to school anymore.” Gu Fei sighed, “In the morning, please
        ask Lao Xu for a leave for me. I have to go to Er Miao’s school.”
      </p>

      <p>“Alright, and the reason?” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “I have a fever,” Gu Fei touched his own forehead. “So hot it burns the
        hand, and it will last from the afternoon of today until midday
        tomorrow.”
      </p>

      <p>“… okay,” Jiang Cheng laughed.</p>

      <p>
        As Gu Fei carried Gu Miao in one hand and the skateboard in the other,
        then turned around and walked ahead along the road, Jiang Cheng looked
        at his back, feeling somewhat moved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before, he had always thought that Gu Fei lived very casually—casually
        letting his sister tread on her skateboard all over the street, casually
        being late to class or cutting class altogether, casually playing
        basketball – everything as he wished, without suffering any scruples.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now that he thought about it again, perhaps, that wasn’t the case.
        In his family, Gu Fei seemed to be the one who handled everything –
        alone. For such a person, how could he actually do as he desired…
      </p>

      <p>
        No one could do as they desired, Gu Fei couldn’t, and he couldn’t
        either.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was like how he didn’t want to stay at Li Baoguo’s place, didn’t want
        to stay in this strange and broken city, didn’t want to face his current
        life, but he had no other choice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every change—even the slightest—would affect everything else.<a
          href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if he had the habit of staying out all night before, now he could
        not do it so casually.
      </p>

      <p>Because he had no place to go.</p>

      <p>
        Not many people could do whatever they wanted without care and just “be
        themselves”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo did not go out to play cards tonight. He was home coughing the
        entire night. Even the constant snoring would turn into a cough. He
        would smack his lips, and teeth grinding – a ruckus so loud it could
        provoke mortals and gods alike.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng – in his not completely soundproof room – could clearly hear
        whoever was upstairs either wearing slippers or sneakers, walking around
        in their place, which kept his eyes open all night.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he woke up in the morning, he felt so tired that even as he walked,
        he felt he was floating.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you want to go have a checkup at the hospital?” he said to Li
        Baoguo, who was putting on his shoes, wanting to leave as soon as
        possible to catch the early gambling get-together. “You were coughing
        pretty badly, is it pharyngitis?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Look, look! This is my son!” Li Baoguo said happily in a very loud
        voice, “It’s nothing, I’ve been coughing for many years. It’s a chronic
        illness. There’s no need to go to the hospital since there’s no
        problem!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wanted to say that there were faults in his wordings, but he
        ended up not saying anything. Li Baoguo had already swung the door in a
        haste and left.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Shit, so be it if you want to be sick.</em> Li Baoguo being like
        that made him feel as if he was a hypocritical weak woman.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the way to school, Jiang Cheng went to the pharmacy to purchase a
        small box of American ginseng<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> drop as eating it
        could lift his spirit a bit. He used to eat it quite often when he
        studied for exams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that he had eaten it, at the very least, he wouldn’t be that dead
        asleep when he slept during class. He didn’t want to end up snoring in
        class – how embarrassing.
      </p>

      <p>
        As expected, Gu Fei did not attend class in the morning. After the
        morning self-study period, he went over to Lao Xu’s office and repeated
        what Gu Fei had told him as his reason for being absent.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It was so hot he thought he could die, and it started yesterday
        afternoon and will remain so until it can finally recede at noon today.”
        After Jiang Cheng said that, he thought that a night of sleeplessness
        had severely affected his intelligence.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Lao Xu did not seem to take note of his peculiar expression,
        instead, he was happily immersed in Gu Fei requesting for a leave and
        not simply bunking classes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Look, I knew that he could still be saved,” Lao Xu said, with emotion.
        “Just look, isn’t this a request for leave!! I just know how to
        communicate with you kids ah, this was certainly something that needed
        attention and careful skill…”
      </p>

      <p>
        However, Gu Fei did not come to class by noon, and it was in the last
        class of that afternoon, which was Chinese language and literature, that
        he finally entered the classroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu looked at him with concern, “Didn’t you have a fever? You can
        come after the afternoon.”
      </p>

      <p>“Better now,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu nodded his head and knocked on the podium and said
        high-spiritedly, “Next, we’ll continue with the content just now…”
      </p>

      <p>“Did you sleep?” Gu Fei sat down and looked over at Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        “… is it that obvious?” Jiang Cheng half-lay on the table, his eyes
        seemingly unable to stay open.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei said. “Can’t look straight at you anymore. Those who don’t
        know would think that you’ve had a fever all day.”
      </p>

      <p>“Didn’t sleep well last night,” Jiang Cheng said in between a yawn.</p>

      <p>
        “Sorry,” Gu Fei whispered. “For taking up quite a few hours of your
        time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s not because of Gu Miao’s matter.” Jiang Cheng waved his hand, “Li
        Baoguo… he didn’t go out gambling yesterday and coughed all night. It
        was so loud that it was impossible to sleep.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Gu Fei fished through his pocket, took out a small box, and placed
        it in front of him. “Want some?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What…” Jiang Cheng opened the small box and saw a handful of milk
        candies inside. He was lost for words all of a sudden, “Milk candies
        ah?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, don’t you like to eat this?” Gu Fei took out another peppermint
        candy from his pocket and put it in his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I never said I liked them. I was just hungry that day,” Jiang Cheng
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “So, it’s like that.” Gu Fei looked at him with an exaggerated
        expression of surprise, then recollected his expression before taking
        away the candies in front of him. “Then give it back to me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No,” Jiang Cheng glared at him. “I just realized that you’re really
        quite interesting~.”
      </p>

      <p>“Just say whether you want it or not,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng opened his mouth, and after what seemed like half a day, he
        finally said: “Just give me a peppermint to freshen up.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei glanced at him and then felt around in his pocket for a while,
        grabbed a handful and then used his finger to lightly push them around
        in search of one. “There’s no more. How about eating this one, it can
        also keep you awake – quite refreshing.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng took the little round candy that he had pointed at
        from his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        The candy had a tangerine flavor, and there was nothing particularly
        refreshing; Jiang Cheng wrapped his tongue around the candy. What the
        freaking hell would a tangerine flavor refresh, at the very least, let
        it be lemon…
      </p>

      <p>
        He hadn’t finished that thought when the tip of his tongue suddenly
        tasted a faint sour flavor, perhaps the tangerine coating on the outer
        layer turned out to be a bit sour inside?
      </p>

      <p>Without waiting for him to react, this sour taste scuttled out.</p>

      <p>His eyes widened like saucers in seconds.</p>

      <p>Sour, sour, sour, sour, sour, sour, sour, sour, sour, sour!</p>

      <p>What the fuck, it was deadly sour!!</p>

      <p>
        The sourness that saturated his mouth filled him with a bitterness that
        assailed his inner core and his tear gland. He was in such pain that he
        was losing the will to live.
      </p>

      <p>“This…” Gu Fei said, and watched him sit up sharply.</p>

      <p>
        But before he could finish, Jiang Cheng had already spit out the candy
        from his mouth – quite ferociously.
      </p>

      <p>
        The candy was like a small bullet as it flew out with great speed and
        hit Zhou Jing, who sat in front of them, in the back of his neck.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ahhh!!” Zhou Jing screamed out loud, so frightened that he also sat up
        straight. He turned around and reached back to touch his neck, then
        suppressed his voice and asked: “Shit, what is this? It fell into my
        shirt!!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng remained silent; although the candy was no longer in his
        mouth, the traces of its existence had not disappeared – the bitter
        sourness that lived in his mouth still could make anyone tremble
        uncontrollably from its taste.
      </p>

      <p>“Sit properly,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Classmate Zhou Jing,” Lao Xu said from the podium. “Pay attention to
        the classroom’s discipline.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Although the students in this class paying attention to the classroom’s
        discipline put together did not amount to a basketball team, Zhou Jing
        still sat up properly.
      </p>

      <p>
        After two seconds, he turned his head again: “Fuck, why is it sticky?
        What the hell is this?”
      </p>

      <p>“Candy,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “… are you two sick, huh?” Zhou Jing was much aggrieved. He pulled and
        shook his clothes for a long time until that candy fell on the chair.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sorry,” Jiang Cheng said, and after finally regaining back some
        strength, he turned to look at Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei had lowered his head to play on his cellphone, but Jiang Cheng
        could clearly see the grin that he was suppressingon his face.
      </p>

      <p>“Are you fucking seeking death?” Jiang Cheng said in a low voice.</p>

      <p>
        “You said you wanted to freshen up.” Gu Fei dragged his finger on the
        screen of the phone, “Are you still sleepy now?
      </p>

      <p>“What the fuck is that!” Jiang Cheng cursed.</p>

      <p>
        “Not sleepy, right?” Gu Fei tilted his head to the side to look at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How about I write a certificate of merit for you?” Jiang Cheng stated.
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s no need for that.” Gu Fei turned back to play on his phone, “No
        one could understand that handwriting of yours even if you wrote one.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had to admit that he was completely refreshed, and the
        sleepiness had faded.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the urge to punch Gu Fei a few times made him lose his mood to
        even ask him how Gu Miao’s school situation was handled.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the class dismissal bell sounded, Gu Fei put his phone down. “I’ll
        treat you to a meal, thanks for helping out yesterday.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looked at him without saying a word.</p>

      <p>
        “At noon or in the evening, whichever is more convenient for you,” Gu
        Fei said and then added, “Do you have time?”
      </p>

      <p>“… you don’t have to be so polite,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “It’s not being polite,” Gu Fei said. “If it wasn’t for you yesterday,
        who knows what would’ve happened to Er Miao. Just thinking about it
        traumatizes me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng went silent for a moment: “Then, in the evening. I want to
        catch up on sleep.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay,” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>
        As usual, they practiced basketball during the self-study class in the
        afternoon. During this time, the self-study lessons were probably some
        of Wang Xu’s favorite lessons.
      </p>

      <p>
        At noon, Jiang Cheng went to the hospital to change the medicine on his
        wound and asked the doctor to use what was reportedly imported adhesive.
      </p>

      <p>
        For the afternoon, they mainly practiced cooperation with no formal
        game; his wound was alright, and he honestly didn’t feel anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I think we have a chance this time.” At the end of the practice,
        Captain Wang Xu crouched at the side of the court, and jabbed his finger
        at the floor. “Based on the current situation… but our secret operation
        must proceed and let everyone remain as before, that is, to not pay
        attention to us.”
      </p>

      <p>“Just don’t go around bragging everywhere,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t worry,” Wang Xu said, not in the least concerned. “As long as you
        and Gu Fei remain hidden, no matter how much I brag, no one will believe
        it anyways.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh.” Jiang Cheng looked at him, and for the first time, he thought
        that Wang Xu was rather sincere. He was also slightly amazed that he
        could actually face the cruel reality so directly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei,” Wang Xu turned to look at him. “Whenever there’s free time,
        ask those buddies of yours to come and practice with us. I think that
        the result is pretty good.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei sounded.</p>

      <p>
        “Alright, let’s disband.” Wang Xu waved his hand, “The other class
        should be coming in a bit, just remember what our motto is!”
      </p>

      <p>“Motto?” Lu Xiaobin was taken aback, “We also have a motto?”</p>

      <p>
        “Oh, I haven’t said it.” Wang Xu said, “Our motto is——we have a secret
        weapon!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did not react even after he said that this was his motto. He
        just froze, trying to contain the mad laughter that wanted to burst out.
      </p>

      <p>Everyone went completely silent as they looked at Wang Xu.</p>

      <p>
        “We have a secret weapon!” Wang Xu repeated and then waved his hand
        again, “Disband!”
      </p>

      <p>
        When he walked out of the school gate once school was dismissed, Jiang
        Cheng turned to look around out of habit. He didn’t see Gu Miao, who had
        often held her skateboard like a little boss while waiting for Gu Fei at
        the school gate.
      </p>

      <p>
        He glanced at Gu Fei, and Gu Fei didn’t explain anything. He casually
        placed his hands in his pockets and walked along the road.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Didn’t ride your bike today?” Jiang Cheng asked, noticing that he
        didn’t go to get his bike.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei turned up his collar. “I only rode the broken bike halfway
        in the morning before the wheel became completely out of shape.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What?” Jiang Cheng didn’t catch what he said, “How is it out of shape,
        no one tore it…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… you’re so cute.” Gu Fei looked at him, “The bike isn’t really out of
        shape, it just started acting up.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng quite admired himself.</p>

      <p>“You’re killing me,” Gu Fei sighed.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at him and said nothing. If it was Pan Zhi, he would
        have definitely applauded and celebrated this moment.
      </p>

      <p>“What do you want to eat?” Gu Fei asked as they walked.</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t know. There’s also nothing in particular that I want to eat, and
        you don’t have to be so formal,” Jiang Cheng said. “It’s fine to eat
        what you normally eat with your friends, not like it’s a thank-you
        party.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “My friends and I huh…” Gu Fei laughed, “We eat very wonderfully. I’m
        afraid you won’t be able to endure it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What? Eat… shit?” Jiang Cheng blurted out. He was used to squabbling
        with Pan Zhi, and the two had many habitually boring and childish
        conversations.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sometimes, he felt that if no one could see them, people would think
        that they were two seven-years-old.
      </p>

      <p>“No,” Gu Fei said. “Though I can arrange it for you if you want.”</p>

      <p>“Let’s just eat something normal,” Jiang Cheng sighed.</p>

      <p>
        Now he would sigh when he thought of Pan Zhi —this problem was really
        unbelievable.
      </p>

      <p>
        Recently, Pan Zhi’s grandfather was hospitalized, and the whole family
        had been taking turns to accompany him; the two hadn’t had much contact.
        Sometimes, when he looked at his silent phone, Jiang Cheng felt utterly
        lonely.
      </p>

      <p>“Let’s go to the supermarket first,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“Supermarket?” Jiang Cheng froze, “To buy what?”</p>

      <p>“To buy what we’ll eat,” Gu Fei said. “Ingredients and stuff.”</p>

      <p>“Making it ourselves?” Jiang Cheng was very surprised.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei nodded. “My friends and I normally make it ourselves, but
        if you want to eat the ready-made food, we can…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No need.” Jiang Cheng thought that it was better to have it according
        to what Gu Fei was used to. He had never thought to ask for a meal from
        Gu Fei because of yesterday’s situation. “But I have to say first that I
        can only make instant noodles if I make noodles.”
      </p>

      <p>“It’s okay: simple, barbeque,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was surprised again,
        <em
          >in this kind of weather… making our own barbeque? Where would we even
          go?</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        As they walked around in the supermarket, Gu Fei bought chopped chicken,
        some beef and lamb for barbeque, and two bags of dumplings.
      </p>

      <p>“How do you grill dumplings?” Jiang Cheng stared, quite perplexed.</p>

      <p>
        “The dumplings will be boiled,” Gu Fei explained to him with a serious
        face.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I know that dumplings are boiled. I… forget it, I’ll just wait to eat
        them,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>“What do you want to drink? Alcohol or soft drinks?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t want to drink anything.” Jiang Cheng’s mind was crammed with a
        vision of them standing in a wasteland with the cutting northern wind,
        guarding a pile of firewood and a dying fire as they froze half-dead. At
        this moment, just thinking about what to drink, he could feel chills.
      </p>

      <p>
        After everything was bought, Gu Fei took them in the direction of their
        homes.
      </p>

      <p>
        He thought that if Gu Fei wanted him to barbeque at his place… that was
        something he was not unaccustomed to. He and Gu Fei had had many
        interactions with each other recently, but the feeling was still of
        unfamiliarity. If he went to his house, it would be fairly uncomfortable
        – he wouldn’t even go to Pan Zhi’s house.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei did not stop when they reached his family’s shop; he only glanced
        at it and continued walking ahead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng also glanced over, and through the glass window, he could
        see a woman standing at the cash register. From the hairstyle alone, it
        should be Gu Fei’s mother.
      </p>

      <p>
        As they moved forward, this street merged together with the street of Li
        Baoguo’s place.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had been here before; it was quite desolated. After walking
        past the abandoned factory up ahead, there was a road leading to a lake
        with no water… he shivered. If Gu Fei wanted to barbeque by the
        lakeside, he reckoned that he would choose to invite Gu Fei to eat at a
        restaurant.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Gu Fei directly entered the abandoned factory from a small door.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Here?” Jiang Cheng followed in, “This is some sort of factory, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, it was previously a steel mill.” Gu Fei said, “It has been closed
        for a long time… many people have worked in this factory before, Li
        Baoguo as well.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng looked around.</p>

      <p>
        After entering the door, he discovered that this factory was pretty huge
        with everything still inside, and though it appeared rather sturdy, it
        had already become a wasteland; certainly no one had cleaned it either
        since the ground was completely covered in ice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei continued to lead him in, and after they passed through a few
        basketball courts, they entered a building that appeared to be an old
        office building.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Me and… Bu Shi Hao Niao,” Gu Fei said as he walked up the stairs. “When
        we don’t want to stay in the shop, wenormally gather here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s no electricity here, right?” Jiang Cheng looked at the mess
        under his feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We bring our own wires,” Gu Fei said. “In fact, it’s quite lively in
        the summer here. There are lots of open spaces outside, the elder men
        and ladies hold their street dancing<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> activities
        here.”
      </p>

      <p>“Street dancing?” Jiang Cheng repeated.</p>

      <p>
        “En, there are even dance battles. It’s quite fashionable and at the
        peak of its time.” Gu Fei went up to the third floor and took out a key
        to unlock the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced inside and saw that it was an empty room that was
        very clean and tidy with a brick stove in the center. There were also
        many low stools and cotton cushions to the side along with a legless
        sofa.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beside the wall was a barbecue grill and an induction cooker, as well as
        actual pots and piles of bottles of oil and salt and other things.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck?” Jiang Cheng was utterly shocked, “You can practically live
        here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How is it, pretty fun right?” Gu Fei placed the goods they bought on
        the table. “We fitted the lock ourselves. If you want, I’ll give you
        one. When you don’t want to go back or have nowhere to go, you can stay
        here. Li Yan and the others usually come over on the weekends —no one’s
        here the rest of the time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t speak as he leaned against the wall and looked at Gu
        Fei. He was a bit depressed by how his frequent circumstances of “having
        nowhere to go” was summed up by Gu Fei in one sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although it felt bad, he unexpectedly wasn’t angry. He only felt that
        the fact that even a deskmate could tell what his circumstances were was
        really… too laughable.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p></p>

      <p>
        This place appeared quite desolate, but it was actually pretty lively
        —save for the time when the weather around the mill was warm. It was not
        like nobody came around this area, it was just that those who wanted to
        find a place to idle around like them weren’t as quick to come.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t come here often, but he wanted to invite Jiang Cheng out
        for a meal today. He didn’t want to be too far away from home and with
        no decent restaurant nearby, he thought of coming here when Jiang Cheng
        said that it didn’t matter.
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s no heater?” Jiang Cheng sat on the sofa and stomped his feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Make your own fire.” Gu Fei took the lighter from the table and tossed
        it over to him, “There’s a bag of coal to the side of the sofa, find
        some rags outside, and… can you make a fire?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I can.” Jiang Cheng got up and went out; after two seconds, he suddenly
        knocked his whole body violently against the door and entered, holding a
        rag in his hand with and wearing a stiff expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei, who was holding a bag of disposable plates and separating the
        food, was startled by the sudden move. “What’s wrong?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Jiang Cheng pinched the rag with two fingernails. “I just picked
        up this thing… there was actually a dead rat underneath! Scared the shit
        out of me!!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “And you still held onto it that firmly?” Gu Fei didn’t quite understand
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I thought that it was useful, so I…” Jiang Cheng threw the rag into the
        brick stove, “That should be enough to keep it going.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You could have just walked ten more steps and find something else to
        light the fire, the kind with no dead rat underneath.” Gu Fei continued
        to move the food onto the plates.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s too freaking cold. I don’t want to move.” Jiang Cheng squatted in
        front of the stove, “I think I’ve gotten used to it since the pots at Li
        Baoguo’s place have cockroaches in them.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “He usually doesn’t cook since he’s too busy gambling to care about
        food,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I can tell,” Jiang Cheng lit that rag, “If we’re talking about a place
        to sleep then he could probably also sell his home.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It can’t be sold,” Gu Fei took the pot and washed it under the faucet
        in the bathroom before he carried out a pot of water. “The buildings
        have been the mill’s right from the start; the majority of the people
        here are so poor that all they have are themselves.”<a href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh.” Jiang Cheng added two lumps of coal in the fire. He stared at
        it, seemingly entranced.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the coal was ready, Gu Fei placed the pot of water on the stove
        then smashed two pieces of ginger and threw them in, followed by a small
        packet of wolfberry and jujube.
      </p>

      <p>“Are you making soup?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng took the lid. “Do you like eating soup or eating
        meat?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… what do you mean?” Jiang Cheng looked at him, a bit perplexed.
        “You’re cooking a pot of chicken and then only let me choose between
        eating soup or eating meat?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei sighed, “It’s not that. If the chicken meat is placed in cold
        water, the soup will be thicker, and it will taste better. If you place
        the chicken in when the water is boiling, the chicken will taste
        better.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng answered in surprise. “Why?”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei thought that Jiang Cheng’s reaction perfectly reflected the
        quality of a true xueba, without common sense but with a curious mind.
        He did not want to explain it to Jiang Cheng at all. “Just say which one
        you like.”
      </p>

      <p>“Soup,” Jiang Cheng simply answered and took out his phone.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei placed the chicken meat into the pot and covered the lid,
        “The chicken is cooking. Let’s grill something to eat first.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay,” Jiang Cheng looked at his phone as he stood up. “What should I
        do?”
      </p>

      <p>“Eat,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        Li Yan and their gang especially liked to grill, hence, practically
        everything was here. After Gu Fei set up the grill, he took some coals
        from the stove and put them in; everything bought today was ready-made
        meat and only needed the ingredients to be brushed on before grilling
        them – very simple.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Put the chicken in cold water, the flavor of the chicken will gradually
        be released as the temperature rises, so the soup will be very thick.”
        Jiang Cheng sat by the stove, keeping an eye on the fire while reading
        out loud from his phone. “Put the chicken in boiling water, the skin of
        the chicken will be cooked in an instant, sealing the flavor inside. In
        this case, the chicken will taste stronger… right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… right,” Gu Fei glanced at him. “Do you still want to take notes?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “This kind of thing doesn’t usually require recitation of the original
        text, just understanding the meaning is enough.” Jiang Cheng also looked
        at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei turned his head and brushed the ingredient on the meat. When
        Jiang Cheng said this sort of thing, he had the swag of a xueba – the
        type where once he spoke, there was nothing much for you to say.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you guys always gather here? Everything’s here.” Jiang Cheng stood
        up and stood beside the grill, “There’s even cumin?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cumin, ground pepper, chili powder, they’re all here though I’m not
        sure if they’re expired since I don’t know when they bought them.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… fuck,” Jiang Cheng took the bottle. “Let me see… the shelf life is 36
        months, there shouldn’t be a problem. You guys must’ve not come to eat
        these over thirty months ago, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “36 months is how long ago?” Gu Fei took the bottle without lifting his
        head and started to sprinkle the powder.
      </p>

      <p>“Three years,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “At most, half a month ago,” Gu Fei said. “You’re so particular. I
        normally smell it, and if it is not odd, I’ll eat it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You must’ve just eaten it as it is because you don’t quite understand
        the shelf life,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s right,” Gu Fei swept a glance his way. “Can’t compare to a
        xueba’s meticulous life.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The meat skewers began to drip oil after a while, and the smoke
        pervading the room began to emit a strong fragrance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Skewering meat wasn’t a technically difficult job, and with Gu Fei
        appearing remarkably skilled, Jiang Cheng didn’t help him and sat back
        down beside the chicken soup to maintain the fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was silence outside the room —the sky had completely descended
        into darkness, and the open window resembled a cataclysmic black cloth
        that made you feel rather cold, but the stove and barbeque grill in
        front of them showed a bright and utterly steady fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        This kind of feeling was absolutely wonderful, just like sitting in the
        small cornmeal-colored bun that day —outside were the purely cold
        streets shrouded with the freezing wind, and inside the car was silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside the window was the unknown and unsettling darkness, yet before
        them was brightness and warmth.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng quite liked this kind of feeling.</p>

      <p>
        It had been a long time since he came here with depression and anger,
        perplexity and confusion, and all kinds of discomfort. Until today,
        until now, he suddenly felt that he had a steady footing on the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although this feeling might only be temporary, or maybe it was only an
        optical illusion, he nevertheless could not help but want to experience
        it quietly at this moment.
      </p>

      <p>“Can you eat spicy food?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“Just a bit is okay, not too much,” Jiang Cheng answered.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei sprinkled a bit of chili powder then handed him a few meat
        skewers on a plate. “Try it, I like it a little charred, these aren’t
        charred at all.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I also like it slightly charred.” Jiang Cheng took a bite of a skewered
        meat, “It tastes pretty good.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I thought a xueba like you didn’t eat charred food… if you need to look
        at the shelf life, are you not worried about getting cancer from eating
        charred food?” Gu Fei continued to grill.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Aren’t you being annoying?” Jiang Cheng said while eating, “How much
        resentment do you have towards a xueba for you to bear a grudge like
        this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ve lived for nearly 18 years and this is the first time that I’ve met
        a true xueba, it’s hard to stay calm.” Gu Fei placed the remaining
        skewers together on a plate, piled them high, and then put them on a
        wooden box that was turned upside down and used as a table at the side
        of the stove. “A xueba’s mouth is actually pretty foul.”
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a very delightful type of enjoyment in guarding the fire and
        eating meat skewers on a cold day. Jiang Cheng did not want to bicker
        with Gu Fei at the moment, so he gave no voice and simply immersed
        himself in eating.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you want a drink?” Gu Fei looked through a cardboard box to the
        side, “I remember that the liquor from last time wasn’t finished.”
      </p>

      <p>“A white one?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Nonsense, do you drink beer on such a cold day?” Gu Fei took out a
        bottle of liquor and placed it on the wooden box, “At a time like this,
        a bottle of Niu Er liquor is what hits the spot.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at the bottle and hesitated for a moment but then
        nodded: “Alright, just a little.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As Jiang Cheng watched Gu Fei pour the liquor, he was utterly shocked as
        the paper cup was filled to the brim. He had never drunk liquor like
        that before but seeing as how he and Gu Fei could choke each other at
        any time given the way they talked, he didn’t speak and quietly watched
        as Gu Fei placed a full cup of liquor in front of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Perhaps, you think it’s not necessary to say, ‘thank you’,” Gu Fei
        picked up his cup, “But it’s still proper to say thank you once more.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Perhaps, you think it’s not necessary to say, ‘don’t be so polite’…”
        Jiang Cheng also picked up his cup, “But I still have to say, there’s no
        need to be so polite.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed and bumped his cup against his and then drank a mouthful.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at his cup, this bastard drank a cup of liquor as if
        he was drinking beer, thus, in accordance with the norm, he also had to
        drink almost a mouthful.
      </p>

      <p>
        The liquor burned all the way down from his throat to his stomach and
        then rose all the way back up, setting aflame his neck and the root of
        his ears.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei glanced at him, “You don’t normally drink liquor?”</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t drink liquor like I do beer,” Jiang Cheng said, lowering his
        head to take a bite of meat. In fact, taking such a bite while guarding
        the fire on a chilly day like this was immensely satisfying.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You could’ve just taken a sip or two at random,” Gu Fei said. “Aren’t
        you still injured?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t feel anything today.” Jiang Cheng pressed the wounded area – he
        indeed didn’t feel anything. He hesitated for a moment and then asked,
        “Gu Miao… how is she?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Staying home for the time being,” Gu Fei drank another mouthful.
        “Yesterday, those parents called the parents of the other two kids and
        went to cause a ruckus at the school together.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the fuck!” Jiang Cheng’s brows twisted, “They must have done
        something for Gu Miao to react that way since she normally doesn’t even
        look at people straight on.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “They drew in Er Miao’s notebook before.” Gu Fei lifted the lid of the
        pot and saw that the soup inside had already come to a boil. He tasted
        it and added salt and msg. “Er Miao wanted to handle it herself, so I
        never went to ask about it at the school. I also never thought she would
        handle it like that.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He could still remember that when he was in elementary school, there was
        a child with a lower IQ in the class who was excluded and bullied by
        almost the whole class. He had even participated in it, as if afraid
        that if he looked different from the majority, he would have been
        treated the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did the school let Gu Miao return home then?” Jiang Cheng said,
        “Regardless of the cause and effect? Even if it is wrong to hit someone,
        they shouldn’t go so far as to not let her go to school!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “At first, the school wasn’t willing to take her back, but I asked the
        principal for a long time.” Gu Fei paused, and after a long moment of
        silence, he glanced at him again. “Er Miao should go to a special
        school.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… is that so.” Jiang Cheng had guessed that Gu Miao had some sort of
        problem, but when Gu Fei said those twowords, “special school”, he did
        not know how to proceed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “She was born… with a little bit of a problem.” Gu Fei sprinkled a bit
        of cumin on a bunch of meat skewers, “She couldn’t speak and was only
        able to when she was around three years old, though the two or three
        words that bounded out were alljumbled up. She couldn’t learn anything,
        and it also seemed she couldn’t express herself either since she would
        only shriek when she was hungry, thirsty or in pain.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then she…” Jiang Cheng opened his mouth but didn’t say anything. Gu Fei
        kept staring at the things in his own hands when he said all those
        things, and although he appeared to not care in the least, Jiang Cheng
        could perceive his depression.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t ask any more and Gu Fei didn’t go further either.
        What issues Gu Miao had, and how the scar on the back of her head came
        to be, was it truly because Gu Fei’s father had dropped her like what Li
        Baoguo had said…?
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, were the jianghu-like<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> rumours regarding Gu
        Fei real or not?
      </p>

      <p>He was curious about these, but he didn’t plan to ask anymore.</p>

      <p>
        The chicken soup was delicious. In fact, he didn’t know if it was
        because of the cold but the hot chicken soup looked especially
        captivating. With just a sip, he felt so warm that his head became a bit
        dizzy.
      </p>

      <p>“This chicken soup is really satisfying,” Jiang Cheng lamented.</p>

      <p>
        “A xueba like you is too proper,” Gu Fei took a sip of the liquor and
        waved the cup in front of him. “What’s really satisfying is this.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh,” Jiang Cheng paused, picked up his cup and also took a drink
        before nodding. “That’s right.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Although the strength of this liquor was high, and Jiang Cheng didn’t
        normally drink liquor, a paper cup of liquor was nearly gone as he ate
        and drank this time around.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know if it was because of this reason, but he suddenly wanted
        to laugh really bad, like when he brought up their fight in the shop the
        other day and laughed foolishly—right now, he really wanted to laugh…
        foolishly.
      </p>

      <p>“I…” He turned to look at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was drinking a sip of soup but after glancing at him face to
        face, he slanted his head and completely spurted out a mouthful of soup.
      </p>

      <p>With this spurt, their foolish laughing was turned on.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng laughed so intensely that he couldn’t even hold his
        chopsticks, and they fell on the table. He wanted to place them
        properly, but they rolled to the ground instead. He laughed, and while
        reaching out to pick them up, he picked up a small wooden stick and
        placed it at the side of the bowl.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei held the bowl with both hands, and with just a glance of that
        small wooden stick, he laughed so much that half of the soup in the bowl
        spilled out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m dying,” Jiang Cheng laughed and pressed on his wound. “I’m a
        wounded person, I can’t laugh like this…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t speak as he leaned against the wall behind him and
        continued to laugh mischievously for a while longer. Finally, he took in
        a deep breath: “I almost couldn’t breathe.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Once it came to an end, Jiang Cheng originally thought that because the
        wind blew in from the open window, his back occasionally felt a trace of
        coldness, yet now, his back was sweating.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey,” Jiang Cheng fished around in his pocket, looking for a tissue to
        wipe his mouth but even after a while, he couldn’t find any. “I’m dead
        tired.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Looking for tissue?” Gu Fei pointed at the table behind him, “There’s
        some there.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng turned around and saw that there were rolls of paper on the
        broken table behind him.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he reached out far enough and grabbed over a roll, a piece of paper
        was brought down from the table and fell near his feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he picked it up, wanting to place it back, he stopped and froze as
        he looked at the thing on the paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        This staff-printed kraft paper, ripped from a book of staff paper, was
        something that he was incredibly familiar with. Kraft-paper coloured
        staff-paper books were a favourite of his.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was nothing unusual about the ledger line of the musical staff.
        For a xuezha<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> like Gu Fei, it might have been
        bought as an English book…
      </p>

      <p>But what surprised him was the writing on the paper.</p>

      <p>It was more than half of a musical score.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Jiang Cheng blinked as he held onto the edge of the table for
        support and tried to align the double vision before him. Then he hummed
        a tune, “It’s pretty good, what song is this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was still leaning against the wall and stared at him for a while
        before finally speaking: “You also know scores?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nonsense.” Jiang Cheng took the score, leaned back against the table
        legs and looked down. “For a xueba, anything is… this, who wrote the
        song?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei said nothing.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at it for a while, looked up at him and then pointed
        his finger at him: “You wrote this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En?” Gu Fei took a sip, “Why me, do I look like a person that can write
        songs to you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You don’t look like one, but…” Jiang Cheng flicked the paper, “But this
        tonal mark, look at this ‘b’, it’s the same as what you wrote and it’s a
        bit longer underneath, like a one-handed akimbo.”
      </p>

      <p>“What the hell,” Gu Fei laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “Did you write it? Or did you copy it for someone?” Jiang Cheng pinched
        the paper and waved it in front of him, humming a bit more, “It’s really
        nice.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “A xueba is a xueba. You must have learned musical staff in middle
        school huh and you can still remember it.” Gu Fei did not answer his
        question.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck, don’t look down on a xueba.” Jiang Cheng stood up and slapped the
        paper on the table, thinking that he was probably actually invigorated
        by the drink. He held his head high in a good mood and even his words
        had swag. “I’ll show you something eye-opening.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you going to sing a song?” Gu Fei was also in a good mood as he
        stood against the wall and applauded him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wait,” Jiang Cheng went to the sofa and picked up his own school bag,
        “I’m not sure if I brought it… I normally do… oh, here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei watched Jiang Cheng rummaging through his bag for a long while,
        eventually pulling out a semi-transparent and slender plastic case,
        <em>a bamboo flute</em>?
      </p>

      <p>
        The fact that Jiang Cheng knew musical score and could immediately hum
        it surprised him tremendously—for someone like Jiang Cheng, even if Lao
        Xu said that he was a xueba, it was unlikely that many people would
        believe him if his grades didn’t come out. Fighting and taunting others
        was an asset, being good at basketball wasn’t strange, but knowing how
        to read music was really a surprise.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like him, even if he wrote the songs and stamped the composer as Gu
        Fei, an unfamiliar person would have thought that he beat the composer
        and stole it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was probably excited because of the liquor. One paper cup of
        liquor was probably two and a half glass, andJiang Cheng’s cup was
        already empty; for someone who didn’t normally drink, having two and a
        half in their stomach at this rate was an almost revolting behavior.
      </p>

      <p>“A flute? So meticulous.”</p>

      <p>
        “En, a tin whistle,” Jiang Cheng cleared his throat. “An Irish tin
        whistle. I really like it, though I don’t play often. I didn’t play it
        at my previous home either.”
      </p>

      <p>“Why?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Because it doesn’t look as posh as a piano,” Jiang Cheng laughed. “My
        mom… anyways, she doesn’t like it, said it was noisy and that she likes
        the piano.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can play the piano?” Gu Fei looked at Jiang Cheng’s hands. He
        didn’t pay attention to them before, and now that Jiang Cheng’s fingers
        were pressed on the finger holes<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>, they were
        pretty long—the knuckles connecting to the long, slender fingers were
        clear but not obtrusive.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yes, do you want to kneel down? I think there’s a cushion on the sofa.
        You can bring it over,” Jiang Cheng pointed to the ground in front of
        him with the tin whistle, “Just kneel here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed as he felt for a stick of cigarette and let it hang in
        his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        He thought to himself that he probably had never heard a tin whistle
        before, but after Jiang Cheng played out that short section, he reacted.
        For a short period of time, Ding Zhuxin really liked Celtic music and
        would listen to it all day long; there were various recorders and
        bagpipes.
      </p>

      <p>He didn’t know what Jiang Cheng played, though it sounded familiar.</p>

      <p>
        Just as he was lamenting that Jiang Cheng could also play this and
        played it rather well, with his fingers leaping nimbly on the finger
        holes… Jiang Cheng suddenly stopped, tilted his head to the side and
        coughed. “Sorry, let me start over.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei had to applaud again.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at him then placed the whistle back to his mouth
        once more. His eyes hung low before his fingers soon jumped, and the
        notes slipped out again.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the first time that Gu Fei had ever heard someone play a
        whistle in front of him— there was an indescribable feeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s usually uncomfortable and irritated face disappeared when
        the first note leaped out, and his slightly shaking lashes appeared calm
        and peaceful.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this second, Gu Fei wholeheartedly accepted Jiang Cheng’s setting as
        a real xueba.
      </p>

      <p><em>Translate: Sae | Proofread: Ice/Anasofi</em></p>

      <p>The author has something to say: Continuing tomorrow.</p>

      <p>
        The time to show off your talents has arrived; “Da Fei please make sure
        to focus on staring at the shining-all-over Cheng-<em>ge</em>
        <em>yo~</em>” The author, who now has a small heating coaster and has
        been drinking hot coffee this entire time, says extremely happily.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I will share the song that Cheng-<em>ge </em>played on Weibo today, you
        can give it a listen to better integrate yourself.” The author who felt
        that they are incredibly considerate pulled out a small black cashmere
        cushion from the closet and patted the fur while talking.
      </p>

      <p>
        “A private space and alcohol! This is precisely the author’s scheme!”
        The small black cashmere cushion cried out as it splayed on the ground.

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The sound of the tin whistle was pretty clear, coupled with the
        resonance of the interior space, it sounded both mellifluous and
        spirited.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Gu Fei did not know why anyone would think that such an instrument was
        not as posh as a piano. Jiang Cheng stood there leaning against the
        table, holding this small, black, and delicate tube in his hand – it was
        unforgettably posh.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The tune that he played sounded quite cheerful and lighthearted, but Gu
        Fei could inexplicably hear a bit of loneliness; he didn’t know whether
        it was the instrument itself or the person playing it.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The last note reverberated in the dancing flames, and after it slowly
        disappeared, Jiang Cheng’s hand that held thewhistle dropped down;
        neither of the two uttered a word.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        After a while, Jiang Cheng looked up with a slight smile that was barely
        distinguishable at the corner of his mouth. “How was it?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Excellent,” Gu Fei answered and applauded.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Say something good, why don’t you.” Jiang Cheng took a small velvet
        cloth and wiped the mouthpiece of the flute. “Asking for a beating the
        moment you open your mouth.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Really amazing,” Gu Fei answered once more. “You must have practiced
        for a long time, right?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “En,” Jiang Cheng sounded in agreement but then thought about it and
        shook his head. “It shouldn’t be that long either, not as long as the
        amount of time that I have practiced the piano.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Not that long yet you can play it that well,” Gu Fei said. “You deserve
        to be called…”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        When Gu Fei only managed to say half of it without continuing, Jiang
        Cheng sighed. “Yes, a x-u-e-b-a. When are you going to be done with this
        standing joke, huh?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Gu Fei laughed for a moment and then finally added, “You’ve honestly
        played it very well.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Actually, it’s not that difficult, starting is pretty easy.” Jiang
        Cheng held the tin whistle in his hand, twirled it a few times, and
        passed it over to him. “Want to give it a try?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “…then I’ll try it.” Gu Fei walked in front of him and took the tin
        whistle, “Play it directly?”
      </p>

      <p>“How else?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“What I meant was, do you have mysophobia?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng laughed out loud, feeling that he couldn’t endure it anymore
        on this night – he laughed for what seemed like most of the day and
        finally pointed his finger in all directions. “In this environment,
        whoever has mysophobia would have collapsed the second they entered.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “True, you just took the quilt from a dead rat.” Gu Fei looked at the
        tin whistle, studying its appearance, and pressed his fingers on the
        finger holes. “Like this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng lightly flicked his fingertips. “Press on it hard, and
        the sound will come.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After Gu Fei properly pressed it, he attempted to softly blow into the
        mouthpiece.
      </p>

      <p>
        The whistle produced a rather staggering and ear-piercing shrill; he
        frowned and tilted his head to the side, “Hey, what’s with this sound,
        scared the crap out of me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng restrained a laugh, “Loosen up a bit when you blow. It’ll
        sound better when you let it flow and not stop.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay.” Gu Fei inhaled and then blew into the mouthpiece once more.</p>

      <p>
        This time, it was a lot better; the tune echoed and stretched out,
        though the sound was…
      </p>

      <p>
        “Forget it,” Gu Fei loosened his hold on the tin whistle. “Starting may
        be easy but that doesn’t mean you can listen to it with just two blows.
        With just these two steps, anyone who didn’t know better would have
        thought that I was calling out for a silly husky<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a
        >.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re still too tense.” Jiang Cheng took the whistle, and casually
        rubbed the mouthpiece on his own pants. “Look at my face, relax.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at him earnestly as he played a musical scale<a
          href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >: “Understand?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “If I say I don’t understand,” Gu Fei laughed. “Are you going to scold
        me?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t speak and continued to play, another scale, a short
        tune, and after he played for a while, Gu Fei poked his face. “You said
        this needs to relax…”
      </p>

      <p>
        The cheerful tune suddenly stopped and the whistle in Jiang Cheng’s hand
        immediately smacked Gu Fei’s hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck!” Gu Fei pulled his hand back, and then swinging his arm and
        rubbing the back of his hand, he cursed. “What’s wrong with you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng suddenly felt an embarrassing feeling of wanting to jump out
        of the window. He wasn’t sure of whether it was because of the liquor or
        the close face-to-face contact that made him always feel the atmosphere
        —in all its entirety— was ambiguous all along.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s voice and Gu Fei’s words as he breathed, all made him feel a
        bit dizzy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The touch of his fingertips on his face was only a light touch, and the
        area was so small that it was negligible, but that action nevertheless
        made him somewhat overreact.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this moment, he could not distinguish whether it was his own
        conditioned reflex or a subconscious avoidance.
      </p>

      <p>
        The key was that Gu Fei had been incomprehensibly smacked by him, and he
        had no means to explain it.
      </p>

      <p><em>Hello, I really don’t like others touching me.</em></p>

      <p>
        <em
          >And because I like men, I don’t want to be touched by them even
          more.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Hello, Wang Jiuri saying that I was troublesome is actually a correct
          judgment…</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wang Xu said that a troublemaker like you don’t let others pat your
        shoulders.” Gu Fei looked at him and snatched his internal dialogue,
        “You truly are troublesome.”
      </p>

      <p>“Ah,” Jiang Cheng also looked at him. “You’ve only realized that?”</p>

      <p>Gu Fei went silent and stared at him.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t know what to say either, so he just stood there as
        well and stared straight back at Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        After staring for a mere ten seconds, Jiang Cheng felt that things were
        not too encouraging – he wanted to laugh.
      </p>

      <p>He really wanted to laugh.</p>

      <p>
        If he actually laughed his head off without end right after just
        smacking Gu Fei like that, Gu Fei ought to come and fight with him,
        right?
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, alcohol could not be swallowed at random as it could easily
        spoil things.
      </p>

      <p>
        After this myriad of thoughts, he gritted his teeth without laughing. Gu
        Fei was probably tired from staring at him; he rubbed his hand again:
        “Luckily you’re not a girl, otherwise, you can’t get married<a
          href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng howled with laughter at that exact moment.</p>

      <p>What the fuck are you laughing your ass off at!</p>

      <p>What the hell was there to laugh about!</p>

      <p>
        A paper cup of Niu Er liquor could actually make him mentally retarded!
      </p>

      <p><em>Jiang Cheng, are you fucking stupid? Yes.</em></p>

      <p>
        He furiously scolded himself while laughing until he leaned against the
        table behind him – even shaking uncontrollably.
      </p>

      <p>“Do you believe that I won’t smack you?” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng covered his wound area and continued to laugh joyously, and
        Gu Fei, finally infected by his mental retardation once again, laughed
        out loud.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, aside from this mental retardation, there was also an advantage
        – the embarrassment that enveloped Jiang Cheng was, at long last,
        laughed away.
      </p>

      <p>It was just, the laughter hurt his sides.</p>

      <p>“Hey…” He fell onto the sofa, “Sorry, I must have drank too much.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei let out a leisure breath, presumably waiting for the laughter to
        pass then he walked over and sat heavily down on the sofa beside him.
        “Wang Xu said that he only patted your shoulder and you wanted to punch
        him?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Although the sofa was quite shabby, the elasticity of it was still
        surprisingly good. Gu Fei pounced on it like a cannonball, causing Jiang
        Cheng to bounce up – feeling dizzy as if he was about to take off.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m not interested in punching that coward.” He patted the sofa then
        stood up and also pounced on it.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei also bounced up.</p>

      <p>
        “Aren’t you being childish,” Gu Fei said, and then got up and pounced on
        it again.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You started it…” Jiang Cheng slanted slightly from that and fell on Gu
        Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        This sofa was not large. It was a small two-person sofa, and thus, with
        this fall the two directly pressed together – their heads nearly
        connecting.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Jiang Cheng whispered and held onto the sofa in an attempt to
        sit upright.
      </p>

      <p>
        With a push of his hand, he directly pressed into Gu Fei’s hand instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s hand was very warm, and the feel of his knuckles beneath the
        palm of his own hand was unusually distinct.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this time, Jiang Cheng, did not have a conditioned reflex. He,
        himself, didn’t even know the reason for why he froze in place as if he
        had been pressed on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t speak or move, and when he turned his face, his breath
        swept by the edge of his ear.
      </p>

      <p>“You…” Jiang Cheng opened his mouth without knowing what to say.</p>

      <p>“What?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        That simple word —under the influence of alcohol and the close range—
        resembled a sparkling electric current, and as soon as that voice
        emerged, Jiang Cheng felt all the pores on half his body explode.
      </p>

      <p>He turned his head, and kissed Gu Fei’s face.</p>

      <p>He had gone mad.</p>

      <p>
        That was the only detail flashing in Jiang Cheng’s mind – apart from
        that, everything else was completely empty.
      </p>

      <p>Your brains must be fucking missing.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei still did not move or say anything else. At that moment, the two
        seemed to be frozen in a fix and endless space.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei did not react, and Jiang Cheng could not clearly see the
        expression in his eyes either because of the dizziness – he only hoped
        that a bolt of lightning would strike away this moment from them.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng woke up in the morning, the time on his phone displayed
        half past ten along with three missed calls from Lao Xu.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the first time that he was late since school started; if he was
        any later, it could result in cutting half the day of classes.
      </p>

      <p>He sat up on the bed with eyes half-closed and head hung low.</p>

      <p>He did not want to go to school.</p>

      <p>He really did not want to.</p>

      <p>Because of yesterday’s event.</p>

      <p>His last memory was of his lips touching Gu Fei’s face.</p>

      <p>After that, he couldn’t remember anything else.</p>

      <p>Even if he could remember it, he didn’t want to remember it.</p>

      <p>
        Forcibly drunk to cut off the images —forcibly forgetting such a memory.
      </p>

      <p>If not for his incompetence, he should forget that scene.</p>

      <p>
        He didn’t sleep soundly that night and had many dreams that he had all
        completely forgotten… now that he recalled them, they were just a cloud
        of white and black smoke.
      </p>

      <p>That made him feel extremely exhausted.</p>

      <p>And the first feeling after being sober was shame.</p>

      <p>And uneasiness.</p>

      <p>
        He had known Gu Fei for half a winter vacation plus another half a
        semester<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>, yet after having some alcohol, he lost
        his mind and kissed him… right, got drunk and acted crazy.
      </p>

      <p>Got drunk and acted crazy —that was a great explanation.</p>

      <p>
        His tolerance for alcohol was not adequate to withstand finishing up
        that large cup of Er Niu beer in such a short amount of time, so he was
        intoxicated.
      </p>

      <p>Intoxication made him behave atrociously.</p>

      <p>A thoroughly beautiful explanation.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng got out of bed and put on his clothes. Thinking of that
        reasonable explanation made him suddenly feelrelieved. After he washed
        up, he returned Lao Xu’s call and hurried to school with his bag.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he entered the school, it happened to be in between classes, so he
        carried his bag and went in from the back door.
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, he was calm and composed on the way here, but the second he
        stepped foot in the classroom only to see that Gu Fei had actually not
        cut class and was looking down while playing that retarded Craz3 Match
        game, he suddenly became slightly uneasy once more.
      </p>

      <p>
        He swore to the god of xueba that before he had kissed Gu Fei, he didn’t
        have any motive toward Gu Fei. Besides feeling normal things that the
        general public would admire such as him being good-looking and having
        nice hands and so on, he didn’t have any other intentions.
      </p>

      <p>But he did not know whether Gu Fei would mind or not.</p>

      <p>
        Although Jiang Cheng was not too willing to admit it, Gu Fei was the
        only person that he was willing to spend time with in all the days that
        he had been here in this city, and someone he could regard as a
        “friend”.
      </p>

      <p>He felt a faint hint of fear.</p>

      <p>
        If he broke his relationship with Gu Fei, who else could he chat with?
      </p>

      <p><em>Zhou Jing?</em></p>

      <p><em>Wang Jiuri?</em></p>

      <p>This sudden confusion made him inexplicably nervous.</p>

      <p>
        If he had never interacted with Gu Fei, he would have always
        disassociated with the crowd, and this kind of feeling would not have
        been so obvious.
      </p>

      <p>“I’m going in,” Jiang Cheng kicked the leg of Gu Fei’s chair.</p>

      <p>
        “Yo.” Gu Fei looked up and seemed to be surprised, “Thought you wouldn’t
        come today.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Overslept.” Jiang Cheng squeezed from behind the chair and sat down; Gu
        Fei appeared normal, which made him feel relieved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took out the tin whistle from the drawer, “You forgot to take
        this yesterday.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng received the whistle – the word “yesterday” had nearly
        caused his hand to tremble.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you still want the key to the steel mill?” Gu Fei asked while
        sweeping his fingers on his phone screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        “… want.” Jiang Cheng thought about it, “Bu Shi Hao Niao, they won’t
        mind?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s there to mind?” Gu Fei took out his own key and gave him one at
        the top. “In any case, they’re not a good bunch<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>,
        just ignore it if they have any complaints.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>“They won’t mind. It’s not like they don’t know you,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“Thanks,” Jiang Cheng took the key.</p>

      <p>
        “Treat me to a meal when you have time.” Gu Fei continued to play his
        game, “The stuffed flatbread from Jiuri’s place is fine.”
      </p>

      <p>“… why?” Jiang Cheng froze.</p>

      <p>“I gave you the key,” Gu Fei said. “I still have something on you.”</p>

      <p>“What?” Jiang Cheng turned his body.</p>

      <p>
        “If you don’t treat me to a meal, I’ll tell Jiuri that you behaved
        immorally toward me,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The… fuck?” Jiang Cheng felt extremely shocked that he could no longer
        be embarrassed, “I fucking drank too much, okay?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ask around here if anyone becomes intoxicated from drinking only two
        and a half cups of Niu Er liquor.” Gu Fei laughed out loud.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then I am the one that gets intoxicated off of two cups,” Jiang Cheng
        felt quite mystical. “What, you guys don’t allow anyone with low alcohol
        tolerance? There’s even discrimination based on alcohol tolerance?”
      </p>

      <p>“That’s right. You’re a southerner?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“… I’m not,” Jiang Cheng reminded him.</p>

      <p>
        “From here,” Gu Fei put down his phone and waved his hand in the space
        in front of him and said, “All places south of here are part of the
        South.”
      </p>

      <p>“Bullshit,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “Just let it go. I’ve already agreed with you about your low alcohol
        tolerance, yet you won’t even agree with my bullshit,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>“I…” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t laugh.” Gu Fei pointed at him, “I’m serious. If you laugh again,
        I’ll really invite you to meet at the back of the school.”
      </p>

      <p>
        It was fine if those words weren’t said, but as soon as they were, Jiang
        Cheng could feel himself wanting to laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, Zhou Jing turned his head around at this time: “Jiang
        Cheng, Jiang Cheng? Jiang… I need to discuss something with you.”
      </p>

      <p>“What ‘something’?” Jiang Cheng sighed.</p>

      <p>
        “Midterm exams are almost here,” Zhou Jing said. “Let me see the answers
        during the exam.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How’s the seating arrangement for exams?” Jiang Cheng asked, having
        heard such a request many times over.
      </p>

      <p>
        In his previous school, they sat separately. No matter which exam, half
        the class had to take their exams in the laboratory or some other place.
        With the order also being disrupted, and not going according to the
        student ID number, bumping into somebody that you could copy the answers
        off of could even be considered to be someone you have destiny with.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that he recalled it, his relationship with Pan Zhi became this good
        probably because during every exam, the two were always in the same
        classroom with the same examination papers.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The desks are pulled apart a bit and the exam starts, how else?” Zhou
        Jing said.
      </p>

      <p>“Oh, separate A and B exams?” Jiang Cheng asked again.</p>

      <p>“No,” Zhou Jing said.</p>

      <p>
        “… oh.” Jiang Cheng thought that Pan Zhi could only wish with all his
        might to come and take exams at Si Zhong – there was literally no point
        in not copying.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just place it on the table, I can look at it myself,” Zhou Jing said
        again.
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng sounded.</p>

      <p>Zhou Jing lied back on his table with satisfaction.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng turned to look at Gu Fei, remembering that they were talking
        before Zhou Jing interrupted, but after turning his head, he forgot what
        he wanted to say again.
      </p>

      <p>“I won’t copy it,” Gu Fei looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng turned, then thought about it and turned his head
        again. “Do you answer yourself on the exams?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “Can you answer them?” Jiang Cheng felt that the book on Gu Fei’s desk
        had never been opened before. In class, he either slept or watched
        videos, listened to music or played that retarded Craz3 Match game.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Answering can be done. Just fill in the answer that fits your eyes,
        what can’t be answered.” Gu Fei took out a piece of candy, “Wanna eat
        one?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced over and saw that little round candy from yesterday,
        “No!!”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei put the milk candy in his mouth and laughed for half a day.</p>

      <p>
        For several days after that day, Gu Fei never mentioned the drinking
        that took place. It was almost the same every day; he was late, played
        on his phone in class, and went to practice with a group of people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Either occasionally cutting classes or requesting leave, Jiang Cheng
        could still perceive Lao Xu’s profound disappointment and frustration.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for the key to the little room, Jiang Cheng strung it on his own
        keychain.
      </p>

      <p>
        His keys were many in number; a key to the front door of his previous
        home, a key to the garage, a key to his room, a pile of keys to his
        drawers, all of which he still carried with him even after he came here.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he placed the key to the little room in his keychain, he hesitated
        a moment. He then removed the originals, though seeing that there was
        only a single key left on the keyring, he sighed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo’s place had a chain of keys; the rooms all had locks though
        the keys had long gone missing and the drawers in the place were all
        unlocked.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he hung the key to the small room, Jiang Cheng held the key in his
        hand, gripping it and feeling rather upset —the feeling of loneliness
        and helplessness was, however, no longer that intense.
      </p>

      <p>
        The days would always move forward, and the people would always change
        —he did not know whether to let it fade from his memory or adapt.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao did not go to school for a week after the incident, Jiang Cheng
        knew that very clearly because every day, she would slip into Si Zhong
        during the third period and come to stand in the corridor in front of
        their classroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        And today, she arrived even earlier. There were still a few minutes
        remaining of the second class when Jiang Cheng saw her hugging her
        skateboard with half her head popping from the classroom door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei made a gesture with his hand, signalling her to go to the
        corridor.
      </p>

      <p>She turned and went to lean over the railings in the corridor.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng thought that the fight from that day and not being able to
        attend school seemed to not have any effect on her at all; she was still
        the same as before.
      </p>

      <p>
        He rested his body on the table and let his sight flow out of the window
        ahead, but midway, it was intercepted by Gu Fei’s profile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was also looking out the window —bright sunlight spilled in, and
        a faint halo was drawn on his profile.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng suddenly recalled that night.</p>

      <p>
        At first, it had already become fairly vague and even what the feeling
        of touching Gu Fei’s face felt like was unclear, but this glance brought
        all the memory back.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck!</em></p>

      <p>
        How he embarrassingly fell onto one side of the sofa, how Gu Fei so
        calmly lit a cigarette and had even given him one, how the two of them
        together finished smoking the cigarettes, and how again they magically
        finished the chicken soup together… all the details that he clearly
        remembered —but had forcibly forgotten— flitted before his eyes without
        warning.
      </p>

      <p>Why was this brain so disobedient now?!</p>

      <p>“Stuffed flatbreads,” Gu Fei said as he turned his head.</p>

      <p>“Ah,” Jiang Cheng answered, returning to his senses. “Ah?”</p>

      <p>“When will you treat me? The competition is tomorrow,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“Today then,” Jiang Cheng said. “Bring Gu Miao?”</p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p><em>The competition is tomorrow?</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took out his phone and looked at the date. It was true, the
        time had seemingly flown by somewhat quickly but then again, it hadn’t
        passed very efficiently either; the red banner for the school’s big
        competition had already been pulled out for several days.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao was in a good mood that day, circling around them on her
        skateboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I have to make a phone call first.” Wang Xu took out his phone while
        walking, “For the donkey meat, I have to let my dad make it first and
        leave us some of what we want… by the way, just come to my house this
        afternoon. The members of our basketball team, Lao Xu, have helped us
        borrow some uniforms and separate them, and also, we need to discuss the
        tactics.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Miao. The little girl’s hair had grown
        quite fast, and it could be seen at the edge of her hat though there
        just wasn’t much style to it. Gu Fei, himself, had shaven his own head
        into a skyline-breaking style and even drew patterns, so if his own
        sister wasn’t bald then it was a mess of a head…
      </p>

      <p>“Your wound is okay now?” Gu Fei whispered from beside him.</p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng touched his wound. “Basically nothing’s wrong.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t speak but then suddenly reached out and patted his
        shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looked at him: “What are you doing?”</p>

      <p>“Your conditioned reflex is dormant?” Gu Fei patted again.</p>

      <p>
        Just then Jiang Cheng reacted and didn’t say anything for a long time.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        Jiang Cheng and Gu Miao were walking at the very front while Gu Fei and
        Wang Xu were on their bikes, using their legs to push and follow behind
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu kept on talking on the side about his plans for the competition
        while Gu Fei wasn’t listening carefully; what Wang Xu wanted was only to
        speak anyways, having an audience wasn’t the most important.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei continued to play games on his phone. He had already made it to
        the last level of Craz3 Match and intended to pass it before the next
        level update, but he still hadn’t made any progress in the past three
        days.
      </p>

      <p>“Give me a heart,” Gu Fei spoke.</p>

      <p>“… and then you could bring the ball…” Wang Xu stopped, “What?”</p>

      <p>Gu Fei waved the phone screen in front of him.</p>

      <p>
        “Oh, wait a sec.” Wang Xu took out his phone and sent him a heart, then
        glanced ahead. “<em>Ai</em>, that troublemaker Jiang Cheng is actually
        pretty likable to children. Your sister hasn’t even looked at me
        straight in the eye yet, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “At this age, your face matters in whatever you do.”<a href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
        Gu Fei continued to play the game, “It even matters when you’re playing
        with kids.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Really?” Wang Xu stepped on the pedal of the bike and stood upright,
        then took a look at his reflection from the glass on a store by the
        road. “I don’t think I look any worse than Jiang Cheng. It’s just that I
        don’t look very friendly.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei sounded in response.</p>

      <p>
        In truth, Wang Xu actually looked pretty friendly, and this was the
        reason why his attempts at being the boss by pretending to be cool were
        never successful.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re talking about lacking friendliness, Jiang Cheng’s type of
        appearance was what really lacked friendliness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei always felt that people with slightly drooping eyes gave off two
        types of feelings; one was pitiful, and the other was Jiang Cheng’s type
        – one that made people want to punch him. Adding on the impatient
        expression he usually had on his face, he appeared much less easy to
        pick on in comparison to Wang Jiuri.
      </p>

      <p>
        But… when they were drinking in the steel mill that day, Jiang Cheng had
        a few split moments where he became the first type. After getting drunk,
        he carried a slightly excited look, appearing a little well-behaved.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a pity that this sort of state only lasted for a really short
        amount of time; once he picked up a cigarette, he would return to his
        usual state.
      </p>

      <p>Even when he was embarrassed, it would be like that.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at the silhouettes of Jiang Cheng and Gu Miao jumping on
        and off the skateboard… he had already completely forgotten how he felt
        when Jiang Cheng personally came that day; or it may be more accurate to
        say that he didn’t have enough time to feel anything. But Jiang Cheng’s
        “nothing happened, nobody remembers anything”expression when he
        violently slammed and leaned on the other side of the sofa was really
        funny.
      </p>

      <p>
        If Jiang Cheng didn’t do anything, then he wouldn’t think much of it
        either. Bu Shi Hao Niao… fine, when Bu Shi Hao Niao drank too much they
        were much, much more dramatic than this. Liu Fan even had the desire to
        make a public performance before; he even prepared a camera, but sadly
        he fell to the ground and passed out before his pants could even come
        off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s reaction was a little big but considering his habit of
        making the other person suffer a punch if they even pat his shoulder,
        tug at his clothes, or poke his face, it may not mean anything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t plan on thinking about it anymore. If it was something
        that they were willing to show, then nobody would deliberately hide it,
        and if it was something that they didn’t want to be noticed, then he
        wouldn’t feel good even if he knew.
      </p>

      <p>
        That kind of feeling of being probed open, one can remember for a
        lifetime if they have experienced it once.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t think about much else regarding Jiang Cheng; he was curious
        about him, admired him, had a good opinion of him, and was willing to
        grow closer to him. Plus, Gu Miao, that little girl also really liked
        Jiang Cheng… when Gu Miao immediately grew fond of Jiang Cheng, who she
        only knew for less than two days, it really made him incredibly shocked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some people attracted cats, some people attracted dogs, it seemed that
        Jiang Cheng attracted weird children…
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Er Stuffed Flatbread’s business wasn’t bad; it was packed in both
        the noon and the evening.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was no available boxed room today; Wang Xu’s mom placed them in
        the room where they would usually eat themselves.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s too messy outside,” she said. “It would be fine if you guys sit
        here. You can even chat.”
      </p>

      <p>“Thank you, auntie,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>
        Since Wang Xu had to run in and out to get things, he sat near the door.
        He and Gu Fei were seated a little more inside, with Gu Miao sitting
        directly in between the two of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wipe your hands.” Jiang Cheng grabbed a bag of wet wipes from his bag
        and took one out for Gu Miao, “Your palms are all dark now, did you fall
        today?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao shook her head, took the wet wipes, and briskly wiped her hands
        a couple of times before putting it down.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng sighed. He glanced at Gu Fei, “Do you want one?”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei smiled. “Actually, my philosophy is eating without being clean
        means without being sick…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng ignored him and took out a wet wipe preparing to clean his
        own hands, but he hadn’t even gotten a firm grasp on it yet when Gu
        Fei’s hand reached out to pinch it with two fingers, snatching away the
        wet wipe.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Can you not be so hypocritical?” Jiang Cheng looked at him, “Be a
        little more honest and the world would be a better place.”<a
          href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did you hear that?” Gu Fei looked at Wang Xu and wiped his hands while
        saying, “Be a little more honest.”
      </p>

      <p>“I don’t want to!” Wang Xu immediately replied honestly.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng sighed.</p>

      <p>
        It wasn’t the first time Gu Miao came to eat flatbread. Wang Xu placed
        the small basket containing the flatbread in front of her and she
        accurately took a donkey meat one.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You only eat this type every time.” Wang Xu laughed, “Don’t you want to
        try another flavor?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao ignored him and lowered her head to take a big bite.</p>

      <p>“Say thank you,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao immediately stood up, eating and bowing at Wang Xu at the same
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai, ai, ai,</em> you’re welcome.” Wang Xu had just sat down but
        sprang back up again, also bowing back to Gu Miao, “Please enjoy, my
        Queen.”<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
      </p>

      <p>“You’ve got potential,”<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> Gu Fei remarked.</p>

      <p>“She’s too cold,” Wang Xu replied. “I am being sincere.”</p>

      <p>
        “You don’t want your image as a big boss anymore?” Jiang Cheng asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “With you two here, what big boss can I be?” Wang Xu squinted at him,
        “But don’t you guys drag my hind leg<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> when I
        arrange the formation in the afternoon.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh.” Jiang Cheng lowered his head to look underneath the table.</p>

      <p>“What are you looking for?” Wang Xu looked down with him.</p>

      <p>“Looking for your hind leg,” Gu Fei stated as he ate.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Wang Xu cried out in dissatisfaction, “Deskmates really are
        different! Just by training together for a couple days and you can
        cooperate so tacitly!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wasn’t too hungry today; he didn’t get to eat as much as
        last time before he started burping. He felt like he didn’t even eat as
        much as Gu Miao.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao ate so much that her face was flushing, her forehead all sweaty.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ey,” Jiang Cheng took off her hat and saw a mess of hair, “Your hair…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao put down the flatbread in her hand and raised her hand to grab
        at her hair.
      </p>

      <p>“<em>Ai!</em>” Jiang Cheng grabbed her hand, “It’s all oily!”</p>

      <p>“It’s fine,” Gu Fei spoke from the side.</p>

      <p>“She’s a girl in any case,” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “It’ll be fine if you just treat her as a kid.” Gu Fei took Gu Miao’s
        hat and looked over it, “Is it ripped? Because you fell?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao glanced at the hole on the hat and nodded her head.</p>

      <p>“Let’s get you another one, okay?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao thought for a while, then grabbed the corner of her sweater and
        motioned towards Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>“You want a yellow one now?” Gu Fei asked, “Alright.”</p>

      <p>
        “You’re… going to knit one for her?” Jiang Cheng couldn’t help asking.
      </p>

      <p>“Of course,” Gu Fei glanced at him.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao was very excited over the fact that she was getting a new hat.
        From when they left Wang Xu’s home, she dragged Jiang Cheng to buy
        yarns.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll take you there,” Gu Fei told her. “Cheng-<em>ge </em>doesn’t have
        to go.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao didn’t react. She still held tightly onto Jiang Cheng’s hand and
        didn’t bother to loosen her grasp as she half-leaned on him and held on.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em> has to rest at noon every day. He has to take a nap.”
        Gu Fei squatted down and gazed at Gu Miao as he spoke.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao gazed back at him, her eyes open wide, but still she didn’t have
        any reaction.
      </p>

      <p>“It’s fine,” Jiang Cheng spoke. “Let’s just go. I won’t nap today.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao still maintained that posture, as if she didn’t hear what Jiang
        Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You…” Gu Fei raised his head, beckoning to him. “Let her look at you,
        then speak again.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng squatted down and moved in front of Gu Miao’s line of
        sight. “I’ll go with you. I won’t take an afternoon nap today.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao finally had a reaction; she turned and pulled him forward.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei sighed lightly from the side.</p>

      <p>“Where will we go to buy?” Jiang Cheng asked him.</p>

      <p>
        “Past the bridge, there’s a street that sells yarn,” Gu Fei answered, he
        thought for a while and asked, “You take an afternoon nap every day?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s you who said that I take an afternoon nap every day,” Jiang Cheng
        replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Gu Fei smiled, “I have to take an afternoon nap every day. If I
        don’t sleep, I’ll get tired.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can sleep while in class, you don’t listen anyway.” Jiang Cheng
        pulled Gu Miao, who was standing on the skateboard, forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Can’t do that,” Gu Fei said with a righteous expression. “I have to
        pass that level in Craz3 Match. I’m competing with Li Yan. I have to
        pass that level before him.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re sick.” Jiang Cheng thought for a moment, then reached out to
        him, “Hand it over, let me try.”
      </p>

      <p>“Weren’t you not playing?” Gu Fei took out his phone.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t play only because I’m sick of it.” Jiang Cheng took his phone,
        “Plus my luck was always pretty good. I am a xueba with both luck and
        IQ, understand?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Now it’s you who can’t stop bringing up this joke. Don’t blame me
        again,” Gu Fei said. “I might only have three hearts, is that enough?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t answer as he lowered his head and started playing.
      </p>

      <p>
        From Wang Xu’s family’s flatbread restaurant to the yarn-selling place
        past the bridge, it was a pretty long trip, but Jiang Cheng stared at
        the phone with his head down the entire time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t have much patience when playing with this game. He was too
        lazy to think about it step-by-step, so he usually just eliminated
        wherever he saw could be eliminated. But Jiang Cheng was different from
        him, he would stare at the screen for an incredibly long time before
        making a move.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took the amount of time that would normally allow him to play at
        least three rounds before raising his head.
      </p>

      <p>“Did you pass?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Nope,” Jiang Cheng continued to lower his head and stare at the phone,
        “Died.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao tugged at the edge of his clothes, excitedly looking around
        without paying attention to the road. He wasn’t paying attention to the
        road either, leading Gu Miao over to a broken step beside the bridge.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei hurriedly pedaled the bike over and grabbed his arm.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng abruptly froze and pulled back the arm that was positioned
        behind him. Gu Fei couldn’t evade on time atop of the bike and could
        only watch as his clenched fist flew towards his nose with a small gust
        of wind.
      </p>

      <p>Had the dormancy of his conditional reflex ended?</p>

      <p>
        But when there was still a bit of distance away from his face, Jiang
        Cheng’s hand stopped.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You didn’t brake so hard that your arm broke right?” Gu Fei loosened
        his grip on his arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sorry about that.” Jiang Cheng turned his head over and glanced at the
        steps, “Fuck.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Er Miao, help Cheng-<em>ge</em> watch the road, lead him.” Gu Fei
        flicked Gu Miao’s head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao nodded her head and with one hand hugging her skateboard and the
        other tugging at the hem of Jiang Cheng’s clothes, she continued
        forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Past the bridge, when they arrived at the storefront of the shop Gu Fei
        usually bought from on the yarn-selling street, Jiang Cheng still had
        his gaze fixated to the screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Three hearts can last you this long?” Gu Fei asked. “We’re here. It’s
        fine if you can’t pass. Even if you don’t succeed, you’ll still be a
        xueba.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Take a look.” Jiang Cheng positioned the phone with the screen facing
        him. There was only one move left.
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Gu Fei looked at the screen.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng extended a finger, made a stroke on the screen, and after
        the burst and disappearance of multiple explosions, he passed the level.
      </p>

      <p>“… amazing.” Gu Fei made a heartfelt sigh.</p>

      <p>“No applause?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei made a round of applause.</p>

      <p>
        “Uhh…” Jiang Cheng handed him the phone, “You just received a message.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Gu Fei lowered his head and placed his phone back into his pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng told him that he didn’t look, but then felt that seemed a
        little deliberate. After all, he did take a glance when the message
        first arrived, and even saw the sender and the content…
      </p>

      <p>– Zhuxin: Come over and listen to me sing today, okay?</p>

      <p>If there was anything after that then he didn’t see.</p>

      <p>
        Initially, Jiang Cheng had always thought that Gu Fei and Ding Zhuxin
        had a romantic relationship; they had a sort of familiarity and tacit
        understanding that people can feel. Plus, the musical note patterns that
        they both had on their bodies, and that day Gu Fei turned on the do not
        disturb mode, he had also arrived at the hospital accompanied by Ding
        Zhuxin.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when he saw Ding Zhuxin’s message, the word “okay” made it seem like
        the two were actually a little distant.
      </p>

      <p>
        People with a very close relationship would more likely directly tell
        somebody to go over and listen to them sing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng entered the yarn shop with Gu Fei and once again felt that
        always thinking over other people’s private affairs for no reason was a
        little unethical. What did whether or not those two are a couple had to
        do with him?
      </p>

      <p>
        “Come to pick out some yarn again?” The proprietress greeted the moment
        she saw Gu Fei. “It just so happened that some new yarn came in these
        two days. This batch isn’t very thick when knitted, perfect for use when
        spring comes by. There’s plenty of colours, and we also have green.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “She doesn’t want green now.” Gu Fei smiled and patted Gu Miao on the
        shoulder, “Go pick out a colour.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao ran over to the rows of priced yarns and looked back and forth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t know a thing about yarn. He never saw anybody knit a
        sweater before at home. Now seeing the bundles and rolls of yarn was
        actually pretty interesting. He also made his way over and reached out
        his hand to grab at the bundles of yarn.
      </p>

      <p>Both thick and fluffy, so comfortable to touch…</p>

      <p>“Isn’t it nice to touch?” Gu Fei asked from beside him.</p>

      <p>
        “Ah.” Jiang Cheng nodded, “It seems like a bundle of yarn and a
        bunched-up sweater feels pretty different to touch.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hand-knitted stuff feels just like a bundle of yarn,” the proprietress
        smiled and said. “Machine-knitted stuff doesn’t feel as good as
        hand-knitted ones.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Really?” Jiang Cheng was a little mystified, “I never wore hand-knitted
        stuff before.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let your friend knit you something then.” The proprietress picked up a
        bundle of dark blue yarn and rubbed it a little on his hand, “This one
        has a lot of yarn and feels good, dark colours are also suitable for
        boys.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah?” Jiang Cheng was stunned, feeling like the proprietress, for the
        sake of promoting her yarn, was really…<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        “You want it?” Gu Fei asked laughingly as he leaned against the counter
        beside them.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No, no, no, no need.” Jiang Cheng hastily pushed aside the bundle of
        yarn, “I have quite a lot of sweaters, and I don’t really need them with
        the weather growing warmer.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can still wear it next year,” the proprietress picked up yet
        another lump of yarn. “This yarn is suitable for…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No, no, no, no…” Jiang Cheng’s face was nearly all red, continuously
        backing up till he was almost outside the door as if wanting to hide. “I
        really don’t need it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei continued to have fun at the side, not making a sound, just
        laughing and watching the show.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your friend didn’t even say that he wouldn’t knit one for you.” The
        proprietress kept lifting up the yarn and evenchased after Jiang Cheng
        with extreme fervor. “Take a look at this type…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jie, jie, auntie, auntie…” Jiang Cheng looked at her with a sincere
        gaze, “I really don’t need him to knit for me. That, I… I also know how
        to knit.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei raised his eyebrows with interest.</p>

      <p>
        “Really?” The proprietress was really surprised. She turned back to look
        at Gu Fei, “You know how to knit, your friend also knows how to knit,
        youngsters these days are really impressive.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, that’s right.” Gu Fei nodded his head, “We are the youngsters of
        the new age.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then won’t you buy some?” The proprietress once again looked back at
        Jiang Cheng, “Aiyo, let me tell you, those who know how to knit would
        find their hands itching if they don’t knit for one day.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t want to say anything else after he said that. In his
        heart, he was burying himself and expressing extreme dissatisfaction
        toward his own behavior.
      </p>

      <p>
        The proprietress’s attempts at promoting her yarn were overwhelming.<a
          href="#_ftn7"
          >[7]</a
        >
        To escape from it, Jiang Cheng could only finally nod his head, “Fine,
        then I’ll… have a bundle.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just one?” The proprietress looked at him, “One bundle to knit a
        sweater?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No, I’ll just knit…” Jiang Cheng really didn’t know what one bundle
        could knit, so he could only send a quick glance at Gu Fei to beg for
        help. Gu Fei raised his hands and he hurriedly answered, “Gloves.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When they finished buying the yarn and left the store, Jiang Cheng felt
        like he was dripping with nervous sweat.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You didn’t even help me a bit.” He sighed, “This proprietress is
        really…”
      </p>

      <p>“You said it yourself, that you know how to knit,” Gu Fei stated.</p>

      <p>
        “Take a look at me,” Jiang Cheng pointed at himself. “Do you think
        somebody with my appearance looks like somebody who would know how to
        knit a sweater?”
      </p>

      <p>“Do you think I look like one?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “… fine.” Jiang Cheng’s words failed him.<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> He
        handed over the small bag containing the bundle of yarn and a set of
        bamboo knitting needles in his hand over to him. “I’ll gift this to you
        since I have no use for this. You can make another pair of gloves or a
        small scarf or something for Gu Miao.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei smiled and took the bag, “Thank you.”</p>

      <p>
        There wasn’t any time to go home after buying the yarn. Gu Fei told Gu
        Miao to go straight to the shop at the intersection, then walked back to
        school with Jiang Cheng while carrying a bag of yarn.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re not going to ask her to take this with her?” Jiang Cheng asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No need,” Gu Fei replied. “Since you passed that level in that retarded
        Craz3 Match game, I now happen to have nothing to do in the afternoon…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You want to knit a sweater in the classroom?” Jiang Cheng was shocked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What?” Gu Fei retorted, “If you want to learn then I can teach you.”
      </p>

      <p>“No need!” Jiang Cheng immediately answered.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei really was an unbelievable person. He actually kept his head
        lowered as he knitted a hat for Gu Miao for the entire afternoon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t really care to listen to the lessons in the afternoon
        classes and couldn’t help but constantly take peaks at Gu Fei. On one
        hand, he was shocked by how Gu Fei’s level of skill was no less than the
        old ladies who would carry around their grandchildren, knit, and chat at
        the same time, and on the other hand, he was shocked by Gu Fei’s hands…
        a person that had a head of only an inch-long shaved hair with even
        engraved patterns, and could press a person against a tree with one arm,
        actually had hands that could be so pretty when holding a knitting
        needle.
      </p>

      <p>
        And what was more unbelievable was that not a person around them was
        surprised by his behavior. Perhaps they were already surprised long ago
        and were already used to it by now.
      </p>

      <p>“<em>Ai</em>,” Gu Fei quietly sighed.</p>

      <p>“What is it?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I dropped a needle,” Gu Fei replied as he kicked a needle over. “I have
        to…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Jiang Cheng couldn’t help quietly crying out loud, “You need to
        do so much all over again? She won’t be able to tell, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You probably won’t be able to tell,” Gu Fei quietly answered. “But Er
        Miao is pretty particular about things. She can’t even accept it if the
        start of the thread is too big. She would throw a tantrum, and you won’t
        be able to coax her.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh…” Jiang Cheng recalled the day where Gu Miao was screaming like mad
        and felt that it really wasn’t easy for Gu Fei to be a big brother.
      </p>

        Gu Fei’s speed was pretty fast. When school was over in the late
        afternoon<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>, he had already finished a small part,
        there were even some swirls in it. Jiang Cheng had an impulse to raise a
        fist and cry out he was awesome.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t go yet for now,” Wang Xu said. “I’m going over to Lao Xu’s to get
        our uniforms. Wait for a bit guys. Let’s head over to my place at night
        to eat some flatbread and discuss tomorrow’s tactics along the way.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The group of basketball-playing people all surrounded Gu Fei’s table and
        chatted while waiting for Lao Xu’s borrowed uniforms.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I think it’s better not to have any expectations,” Guo Xu said.
        “Remember the uniforms from last year.”
      </p>

      <p>“What kind of uniforms were there last year?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“No. 4 Prison Basketball Team,” Gu Fei replied as he knitted.</p>

      <p>“… even that could be borrowed?” Jiang Cheng was stupefied.</p>

      <p>
        “This year, we have so much hope. We shouldn’t have to wear a prison
        uniform again, right?” Lu Xiaobin wondered.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who knows, Lao Xu’s aesthetics have always been different from most.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Everybody chatted for a while. Wang Xu carried two big bags of uniforms
        back to the classroom, and from the expression on his face, they knew
        that these uniforms probably weren’t much better than No. 4 Prison’s
        uniforms.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I think we will have to mainly rely on our temperament.”<a
          href="#_ftn10"
          >[10]</a
        >
        He placed the bag on the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everybody took out the uniforms for a look and then suddenly
        collectively collapsed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Five Star… Farmers?” Guo Xu pulled at one of the uniforms and read
        aloud the words on it. “Isn’t Five Star Farmers, the farmer’s market two
        stops north of our school?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yes.” Gu Fei put away the yarn, stared at the pile of uniforms, and
        sighed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s even a fucking advertisement.” Wang Xu pointed at the uniform,
        “Fresh Noodles.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng really couldn’t hold himself back from laughing; laughing
        and taking pictures of the uniforms with his phone at the same time. He
        then sent them to Pan Zhi.
      </p>

      <p>
        – Grandson, we have a basketball competition tomorrow, come admire our
        uniforms.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s put away the uniforms,” Gu Fei spoke. “I’ll bring over some
        uniforms for you all tomorrow.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’ll be great.” Wang Xu immediately stuffed the uniforms back into
        the bag, “What’re they like?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “My friends’ team’s,” Gu Fei answered. “There’s also a team name and
        stuff, but at least it’s not some Team Farmer’s Market.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck, why didn’t you say this earlier? If you had said that, I wouldn’t
        have let Lao Xu go over there.” Wang Xu stuffed the uniforms into the
        desk, “Let’s go. Let’s eat dinner and discuss some tactics.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng packed up his things and followed the group of people
        outside the classroom.
      </p>

      <p>Pan Zhi’s reply came when they went downstairs.</p>

      <p>
        – Grandpa, I feel so pleased that my tears have almost covered my face.
        You’ve finally fucking turned back to the old grandpa.
      </p>

        The author has something to say: Resting tomorrow, continuing on Friday.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Every day’s “the author has something to say” is so long-winded and not
        in line with my style, so I’ll keep it short.” The author who is
        kneeling on the floor with a cup of coffee says coldly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “So cold!” The black cashmere cushion hanging in front of the heater
        because it got dirtied by coffee powder and had to be washed cried
        loudly.

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Gu Fei was riding his motorcycle toward Liu Fan’s house when his phone
        sounded. He plugged in an earbud and answered the call; Ding Zhuxin’s
        voice resonated from the other end. “Not bad, kid. You’re really not
        showing up?”
      </p>

      <span id="more-6241"></span>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “No, I…” Gu Fei then remembered the message Ding Zhuxin had sent a while
        ago. “Forgot. How about I head over now, where are you?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “It’s okay. It was an informal performance anyways,” Ding Zhuxin
        replied. “I was at WildFire just now, so I called you. I’m out drinking
        with friends now, a place you definitely won’t appear at.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">“En,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “I bumped into Xiao Bing and his group at the entrance just now,” Ding
        Zhuxin continued. “Their lead vocalist changed again.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “They didn’t ask for you to go back?” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “I wouldn’t go back even if they asked,” Ding Zhuxin laughed. “A tough
        nut like me.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “You were at your greatest potential when you were together with them,”
        Gu Fei said. “You don’t have to compete with them because of me. It’s
        been three years now, right? It’s about time to finish it.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Then, are you ‘finished’”? Ding Zhuxin asked.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “I bear grudges. I’ll remember this sort of thing for the rest of my
        life,” Gu Fei answered.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Then, that’s alright,” Ding Zhuxin said. “I don’t bear grudges, I just
        find it disgusting… oh right, whenever you’re free, take some photos for
        me?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Of you?” Gu Fei made a turn and saw Liu Fan walking along the sidewalk
        with two large bags in his hands. He pressed down on the rear brake and
        whistled.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Fuck,” Liu Fan turned his head. “I was just about to see which dumbass
        is brave enough to molest his uncle like this.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “You went to pick them up on foot?” Gu Fei asked.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “They had dropped it off at the intersection.” Liu Fan saw him with an
        earbud in, “You have a call?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, Xin-<em>jie</em>.” Gu Fei turned his head slightly with his foot on
        the ground. “Get on.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Liu Fan straddled onto the seat behind him: “Drive slow, the wind is
        freezing cold at night.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Not for me,” Ding Zhuxin replied on the other end. “The photographer I
        hired for my shop went back to his hometown to get married. I’m not sure
        when he’ll be able to come back, and the model I was used to working
        with also… come and help me with this urgent matter. I have a pile of
        clothes that haven’t been photographed yet.”
      </p>

      <p>“En, sure,” Gu Fei said. “Do you need me to find a model as well?”</p>

      <p>
        “Yeah, just find a temporary person who we can shoot for these goods.
        Just don’t ask Liu Fan, though he does have a nice figure…” Ding Zhuxin
        said.
      </p>

      <p>“But not a good face?” Gu Fei laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “He doesn’t meet the requirements. The goods that I have this time are
        quite “badass”, and Liu Fan looks too honest. He’s like an old gangster,
        not a bad boy,” Ding Zhuxin said. “Do you have anyone suitable in mind?
        Time is tight, so I’m paying much more than usual.”
      </p>

      <p><em>Bad boy?</em></p>

      <p>
        “I’ll look around,” Gu Fei answered. When Ding Zhuxin said ‘bad boy’,
        Jiang Cheng’s face flashed before his eyes for some unknown reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of all the people he was acquainted with, very few of them were not
        “bad”. But for some reason, if it was the term “bad boy”, only Jiang
        Cheng was the most fitting.
      </p>

      <p>
        The basketball competition was quite the occasion at Si Zhong. It
        started in the afternoon during the second period, yet aside from the
        seniors, the first and second years were already piled onto the
        bleachers during the first period.
      </p>

      <p>Four ball courts were all surrounded by people.</p>

      <p>
        Aside from those who grew a sudden interest in basketball because of the
        competition and were fooling around on the court, the teams from many
        other classes were already starting to warm up… or more accurately,
        already starting to show off.
      </p>

      <p>
        The uniform Gu Fei brought was definitely way better than the prison
        uniform and Noodle Fresh Soy Sauce<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> sold at the
        Five Star Farmer’s Market – red in color, and aside from a number on the
        back, there was only an imprinted ‘Fei – 飞 – character designed in
        blaring flames.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you naming the team after your name?” Wang Xu took off his own
        clothes and shrugged into a uniform. “Not bad.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng hurriedly scanned the surroundings, except for them being in
        the classroom, no one else was there; they had already gone to the
        court.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I recommend you wear a t-shirt underneath,” Gu Fei looked at him.
        “Let’s not have our Captain freeze to death before the competition even
        begins.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Everyone, change. Gu Fei, Jiang Cheng, cover up tightly,” Wang Xu said
        as he changed. “These two won’t be going on the court at the beginning,
        secret weapons should be hidden for as long as possible. They will only
        play when we can’t hold on anymore.”
      </p>

      <p>
        From the beginning, Wang Xu was persistent in saving the “secret
        weapons” for the grand finale, but once the competition chart was
        published yesterday, he instantly became aghast. Class 2 had almost won
        against the sophomore team last year but had also almost lost to Class 5
        along the way.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I think,” Guo Xu was somewhat restless. “Let’s not drag it on for too
        long before they go on the court because if the gap in the score
        stretches too far, it’ll be difficult to catch up. It’s Class 5 ah,
        they’re a strong team.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu didn’t answer, but after some thought, he solemnly slapped the
        table. “Fuck! Who knows how this competition chart was made. Lots should
        have been drawn by separating the strong and the weak! At the very least
        it should be a lousy team with a strong team; only that can ensure that
        the competition will be amusing to watch ah!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Captain, there is no problem with the lot. The strongest team
        <em>is</em> Class 5.” Gu Fei finished changing and pulled on a sweater,
        pointing around the group of people on either side of him, “We are the
        lousy team.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “We…” Wang Xu stretched out his neck, unwilling to submit, and sighed
        after a pause, “<em>Ai</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu was also very excited. He ran back to the class, urging them to
        go on the court.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the group walked out of the classroom, Jiang Cheng followed from
        the very back. He felt as though every one of them walked with traces of
        the wind carrying them afloat. It was as if this whole time, they had
        been looked down upon by the common people, yet today, they were a bunch
        of floor-sweeping monks about to become known by the world from the
        battlefields…
      </p>

      <p>
        “The Center<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> from Class 5 is sharp,” Gu Fei said
        in a small voice while walking alongside him. “Wider than Lu Xiaobin by
        a full diameter, like a tower. If the ball ends up in his hands, we
        basically have no chance of getting it back.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng nodded his head, eyed Lu Xiaobin walking in front, and
        tried to imagine the build of that other Center. “You only need to be in
        charge of going up to the basket, and I’ll guard…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do I still need to look at where you are when I pass the ball?” Gu Fei
        asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng turned his head to look at him, and only after a while did
        he answered. “No, I can get there.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei gave him a thumbs up.</p>

      <p>
        Class 8 had always upheld the image of a weak little chick – the
        presence of the other team on the court caused a bit of commotion by the
        audience, but when their team walked by, only their class waved at them
        under the lead of the class representative, Yi Jing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The audience had no interest whatsoever in the team members being led by
        Captain Wang Xu… actually, this was not accurate, there was someone who
        perked their interest – Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to exercise Captain Wang Xu’s “secret weapon” plan in full
        length, Jiang Cheng and Gu Fei did not enter together with their team.
        When they arrived at the edge of the court, quite a few girls raised
        their phones and made no move to conceal their action of taking pictures
        of Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Stay away from me.” Jiang Cheng couldn’t handle it anymore. The girls
        from his previous school also liked to gather together and gossip about
        who was handsome from so-and-so class. He also had pictures taken off
        him. But those girls would at the very least be embarrassed by the
        action and opted to take photos in secrecy – at the very least they
        would act as if they were taking selfies.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now there were at least four to five phones raised toward him from a
        single pod. He suddenly felt a bit awkward.
      </p>

      <p>
        “They’re not all taking shots of me,” Gu Fei smiled carelessly. “Do you
        not know that people had started to poke around about you on TieBa<a
          href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >
        since the second day you enrolled?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… your school has a TieBa?” Jiang Cheng was greatly surprised, and his
        emphasis was even skewered.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Of course, you can go look,” Gu Fei said. “It’s quite lively with all
        sorts of gossip, arrangements for fights, being pretentious pricks<a
          href="#_ftn4"
          >[4]</a
        >, and also failing at being said pricks.”<sup>4</sup>
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng sat down on the chair alongside the court.</p>

      <p>
        “Stand up, stand up.” Wang Xu walked over and waved at him with a smug
        expression. “This is the resting spot for team players, the audience has
        to move to the side.”
      </p>

      <p>“The fuck?” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Secret weapons,” Wang Xu shot him a meaningful look, trying desperately
        to control his mouth from moving while talking. “Cooperate for a bit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>…” Jiang Cheng sighed in exasperation and found a chair to
        sit on somewhere in the back.
      </p>

      <p>
        His previous school had an audience stand. Si Zhong had many courts, but
        if you wanted to watch a game while sitting down, you had to carry your
        own chair over. Thank goodness that although the team from his class was
        so-so, the logistics service was strong, and a lot of chairs were
        carried over.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If we can’t keep up later, Jiang Cheng, you will go up first.” Wang Xu
        instructed from beside him while stretching his arms and legs.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That won’t do,” Jiang Cheng replied. “I have to enter with Gu Fei. I
        can’t cooperate with just myself on the court, there’s no use to that.”
      </p>

      <p>“Da Fei?” Wang Xu looked over at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>“Listen to him,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        “Fine,” Wang Xu jumped up and down. “You guys be prepared, I’m kind of
        nervous…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What are you nervous about?” The state he was in made Jiang Cheng want
        to laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Because I suddenly feel like we won’t last for more than ten minutes
        before you two have to go up,” Wang Xu answered.
      </p>

      <p>“Take the time to show off your true color,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “En!” Wang Xu nodded his head then skipped to the edge of the court and
        did all sorts of warm-up poses to the side.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Jiang Cheng eyed the area he was standing in, he immediately laughed;
        a teacher was nearby, circling around the court with a camera aiming
        everywhere as he took shots.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today’s opening match was probably used to draw attention. The
        sophomores had their two strongest teams scheduled together with Class 5
        on court one and Class 2 on court two. Their rival teams were the number
        one weakest chicken Class 8 and Class 3, the comparatively less weaker
        chicken as opposed to Class 8.
      </p>

      <p>Once the courts were assigned, the match began.</p>

      <p>
        The people from Class 5 were screaming and clapping enthusiastically
        while Class 8 had a much weaker vigour in comparison – possibly because
        their “secret weapon” was so well hidden that even the people from their
        own class didn’t harbour an inkling of hope.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only Lao Xu stood along the sidelines with his hands on his hips,
        shouting toward Wang Xu and the others. “Play well! Play to your
        greatest potential ——show ‘em what you got!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng quite admired Lao Xu — during an atmosphere when everyone
        thought Class 5 was only here to put up a demonstration match, he could
        still scream as if Class 8 was the future champion.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Relax and play! Let loose and play!” The sound of a loudspeaker
        suddenly blasted out from behind them.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sound was quite loud. Jiang Cheng jumped in surprise, and everyone
        turned around together and saw Lao Lu standing in the back row with the
        microphone he used during class in hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Lu Laoshi!” someone shouted from the referee’s seat. “Lu Laoshi! Don’t
        use a microphone, it will cause distractions to the competition.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The game hasn’t even started yet!” Lao Lu said into the microphone.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Put it down you, put it down,” Lao Xu pointed at Lao Lu. “Watch the
        game in peace.”
      </p>

      <p>“Do you want to use this?” Lao Lu continued to speak into the mic.</p>

      <p>
        Yi Jing stood up and walked up to Lao Lu. She said something smilingly
        and Lao Lu handed both the microphone and loudspeaker to her, then
        walked toward Lao Xu to stand with him along the sidelines with their
        hands on their hips.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Lao Lu has quite the confidence in Wang Xu and the others?” Jiang Cheng
        asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “He has a good relationship with Lao Xu,” Gu Fei answered. “They’ve been
        partners for years. If Lao Xu was the homeroom teacher for Class 5, then
        he would definitely find confidence in Class 5.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The game started, Lu Xiaobin and the Tower were in position for a jump
        ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Tower had a name, Gu Fei had said it once, but Jiang Cheng didn’t
        remember it.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the ball was thrown into the sky, Jiang Cheng knew Lu Xiaobin had no
        chance at touching the ball. Though the Tower had a large built, he was
        not slow to react, and was even taller than Lu Xiaobin by half a head
        length.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the ball fell, it undoubtedly landed in the hands of Class 5 who
        immediately sped across the court and arrived at the basket. Class 5,
        who sat across the court, erupted into a sea of cheers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was speechless as he watched them throw the ball into the
        basket with ease, scoring two points with little to no defense.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Zhou Jing,” Gu Fei kicked the leg of the chair in front of him which
        belonged to Zhou Jing, who was feverishly slapping his own thighs. “Go
        scream, tell them to guard.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay,” Zhou Jing instantly leaped over a few chairs and screamed toward
        the court. “Guard them! You guys, guard them to death! Quickly return to
        defense! Make an effort to steal the ball ah!”
      </p>

      <p>Zhou Jing screamed for a while with heightened energy.</p>

      <p>
        But Wang Xu and the others were very visibly nervous from the moment
        they stepped onto the court and were not able to loosen themselves up.
        The opposing team was able to score under a few seconds, and from then
        on, they were continuously oppressed. The people on the sidelines were
        all screaming, but it was as if they couldn’t hear a thing and continued
        to play in a disorderly fashion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within less than five minutes, Class 5 had already scored four baskets.
        Wang Xu and the others had no way of refraining the Tower from obtaining
        the ball, henceforth, they had no way of refraining him from scoring.
        When they finally got their hands on the ball and reached the basket,
        the people from Class 5 hissed and booed from all around; the ball
        hadn’t even left their hands before it was stolen.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck,” Jiang Cheng stared at the time and score shown on the
        scoreboard. “They’re not even<em> this</em> lousy normally.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Li Yadong has been charging towards the basket right from the centre
        line, and no one is able to stop him, plus his movements are excessively
        arrogant,” Gu Fei said and hugged his arms as he leaned back against the
        chair. “The first half of the game is going to continue on like this. It
        may even be possible for Wang Xu and others to score zero points.”<a
          href="#_ftn5"
          >[5]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        “You have to also take the centre line later.” Jiang Cheng watched Wang
        Xu, growing more and more agitated as the game continued. “Kill their
        ego a bit.”
      </p>

      <p>“I’d be threatened by both sides of the centre line,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“There’s me,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>
        After Wang Xu looked toward Gu Fei for the third time, Gu Fei stood up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu then immediately made a hand gesture, requesting for a break at
        Lao Xu.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though the time for a break hadn’t reached yet, the few people on
        the court who saw Wang Xu’s hand gesture immediately acted as if they
        had been injected with a blast of cardiotonic that even their jogs
        increased in speed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei hadn’t even stood up for more than two minutes before the
        audience around them started to notice. Some instantly yelled: “Fuck,
        Class 8 has Gu Fei this time?”
      </p>

      <p>“Gu Fei, Jiang Cheng, get ready,” Lao Xu approached them and said.</p>

      <p>
        It was only then that their class seemed to understand and erupted into
        cheers as they all stood up and started to scream.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked over at Gu Fei. He was starting to feel excited for
        some inexplicable reason – a feeling he didn’t even harbour when he was
        playing in competition with his school team before.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was probably because Wang Xu had brainwashed them with notions of the
        “secret weapon” during this period of time that when he stood up, he
        instantly felt as if he and Gu Fei held the weight of a historical
        mission on their shoulders.
      </p>

      <p>The referee called for a time-out.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng started to take off his pants and immediately felt himself
        bathe in utter stupidity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was a wondrous character enshrined in a mysterious atmosphere at
        school – the big boss who roamed the edges of the earth, battled no one,
        and no one dared to provoke him. He never attended any group activities,
        and yet at this moment, he was going on court to play in a competition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone’s gaze turned their way. The teacher that was taking photos
        outright stood beside them, and there were also numerous phones aimed at
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, at this moment, he and Gu Fei stood between two rows of chairs,
        taking off their pants instead.
      </p>

      <p>This moment couldn’t get any better…</p>

      <p>
        “I’ll start the ball,” Jiang Cheng said. “Wang Xu will come get the
        ball, and just like how we’ve cooperated during practice, we run lots
        and guard them to death. Lu Xiaobin, you just tangle yourself to the
        Tower. You have good stamina so just make sure to be wherever he is.
        Don’t worry about the ball.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Tower?” Lu Xiaobin asked. His stamina was indeed quite well, he wasn’t
        even breathing harshly at this moment.
      </p>

      <p>“Li Yadong,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>“En,” Lu Xiaobin nodded his head.</p>

      <p>
        “Pass the ball from below,” Jiang Cheng continued. “We have no height
        advantage compared to Class 5.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu held no grudge against Jiang Cheng for stealing his role as
        Captain. He simply stood to the side and nodded his head furiously, and
        even walked back onto the court without even remembering to make a
        concluding statement like he normally did.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as Gu Fei and Jiang Cheng walked onto the court, the members on
        both teams, including the audience on the side, experienced a complete
        change in atmosphere.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 5’s team members were completely unclear about Jiang Cheng’s
        skills level, but they had perfect knowledge of how Gu Fei played.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rest of the people from the classes that were not participating in a
        match at the moment all gathered around Court 1.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sidelines were suddenly crowded with people, the cheerleading squad
        elevated in volume, and the people who regarded Class 5 as the rival
        class all started to cheer for Class 8 – the court was filled with
        screams.
      </p>

      <p>“Captain,” Jiang Cheng called out to Wang Xu from behind.</p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu suddenly grew very cheerful and whipped around expectantly.
        “What’s the matter?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “This ball is very important,” Jiang Cheng said. “We’re relying on you.”
      </p>

      <p>“Rest assured,” Wang Xu answered steadily.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng walked to the edge of the court and took the ball from the
        referee. He dribbled it on the ground a few times to get a sense of it
        and – it felt pretty good.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the sound of the whistle, Wang Xu ran past the other team members and
        charged toward Jiang Cheng. But just as Jiang Cheng was about to pass
        him the ball, the shortest member from Class 5 suddenly blocked himself
        in front of Wang Xu.
      </p>

      <p>
        This person’s style was very similar to Li Yan: quick-paced and agile.
        This ball couldn’t be passed to Wang Xu anymore, so Jiang Cheng raised
        his eyes to scan the centre of court – Gu Fei was blocked by the Tower.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Lu Xiaobin was very loyal to his responsibilities, and quickly
        squeezed through.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment Gu Fei escaped, he reached his hands out toward Jiang Cheng,
        and Jiang Cheng threw the ball over to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once he got the ball, Gu Fei did just as he had previously said. He
        turned around and charged toward the basket from the center line.
      </p>

      <p>
        The volume around the court must have instantly increased by at least
        twenty decibels – they were screaming as if a large tide was rolling in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng increased his own speed and followed. From behind, Wang Xu
        yelled in a really upset tone: “Fuck, why didn’t you pass to me?!”
      </p>

      <p>“Follow them!” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu suddenly sped forward as if he was kicked in the back, blasting
        past Jiang Cheng like a gust of wind. He secured a spot right behind Gu
        Fei and got tangled in a mess of “you push, I push” with the other two
        people from Class 5 who were in charge of guarding Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        The team from Class 5 returned to defense<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> very
        quickly, almost at the speed of light in comparison to Class 8’s
        returned defense. By the time Gu Fei eye-catchingly rushed straight to
        the basket from the center line, their people had already pushed back to
        the three-second lane.<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s path to the basket was completely blocked by two people. As he
        backed away, he simultaneously passed the ball from behind his body;
        Jiang Cheng leaped forward with a big step and caught the ball. He
        dribbled past Li Yan No.2 and someone else, and once Gu Fei was able to
        squeeze back in through an opening, he threw the ball back to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        It can’t be denied that the Tower from Class 5 was much more capable
        than the Tower from their own class. Lu Xiaobin was a step away from
        constraining him with a hug, yet he still managed to slip away.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei received the ball, the Tower was like a large duvet that
        covered in front of Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng quickly maneuvered to refrain from anyone locking dead onto
        him. He glanced at the timer, there was still time, Gu Fei would
        probably still pass the ball at this point.
      </p>

      <p>But at the next second, Gu Fei suddenly jumped.</p>

      <p>
        Fuck! Jiang Cheng quickly prepared to intercept and return to defense.
        The Tower jumped along with Gu Fei and pressed down on him like the
        weight of Mount Tai. If the ball was to leave Gu Fei’s hands, it would
        doubtlessly be blocked.
      </p>

      <p>Unless… he played a stunt, then there would still be a chance.</p>

      <p>Sure enough, Gu Fei’s hand violently dropped in the air.</p>

      <p>
        And now, he needed only to hook around the Tower’s arm – the ball
        probably had a chance of going in.
      </p>

      <p>
        These two points were very important as they could arouse the momentum
        for Class 8.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Gu Fei’s next move made Jiang Cheng swear about a big yellow dog in
        his mind. The guy was making a fucking pass!
      </p>

      <p>
        Although Jiang Cheng instantly understood Gu Fei’s intentions as the
        ball flew toward him, he still couldn’t refrain himself from swearing.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” He caught the ball then quickly backed a few steps out of the
        three-point line, and without hesitation, he delivered the ball high
        toward the basket.
      </p>

      <p>
        The instant the ball fell through the net, the tides rolled in around
        the sidelines again. The people from Class 8 jumped up and screamed
        until their throats were about to burst.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Beautiful!” Nobody knew when Lao Lu had gotten his hands on the
        microphone again as he yelled into it. “Beautiful shot!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Wang Xu shouted in Jiang Cheng’s ear with trilling excitement.
        “That felt so good!”
      </p>

      <p>
        With this seamless corporation plus the three points, everyone instantly
        broke out into wild cheers as if they were high on drugs. When they
        returned to their end of the court, it was as if their feet were
        attached to slingshots.
      </p>

      <p>“You got a problem?” Gu Fei asked as he ran past Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>“No problem, I’m just watching you swag,” Jiang Cheng answered.</p>

      <p>
        “Since we’re already on the court and already playing,” Gu Fei said.
        “Then let’s have them die thoroughly.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng responded.</p>

      <p>
        As he ran back along with the others, he suddenly remembered Pan Zhi’s
        message from yesterday.
      </p>

      <p>
        It really did feel a bit like… the previous feelings had come back to
        him.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Class 5 was the most powerful team last year after all. Although Jiang
        Cheng and Gu Fei were caught off guard because they were not
        psychologically prepared to be suddenly on the court, they slowly
        adapted after running for several rounds, and even had targeted defense
        against them.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Unlike Class 8, which only relied on two main players’ cooperation,
        Class 5 had no particularly top-notch players, but their skills were
        even out that even the substitutes were better than Wang Xu.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Sometimes, Jiang Cheng thought that it was pretty amazing that, in any
        school and in any grade, there was always a situation where the
        ballplayers concentrated in only a certain class or two.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        In the few minutes before their opponents recovered their attention, he
        and Gu Fei quickly scored until there was only a difference of one
        point. During that period, Class 5 had only scored two points once.
        After Jiang Cheng scored a three-point throw, Gu Fei continued with a
        layup, scoring another point that caused nearly all the audience at the
        side of the court to reach the peak of excitement.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        There probably was not that much excitement in watching Class 5 and
        Class 2; after all, Class 8 was a weak little chick born out of nowhere,
        so for Class 5 to only score once after several minutes against them was
        a rare occasion.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Most importantly, this was a single-elimination competition<a
          href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >, and the direct end of losing was to join the audience.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        In the first elimination match, the weakest chicken team losing would
        hold no significance, but for a team that <em>could</em> enter the
        finals to lose, now that, that would be simply brilliant – the dark
        horse<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> was well-received by the melon-eating
        masses!<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">“We can win!”</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        When Class 5 called for a time-out, Wang Xu, who was glowing with vigor,
        had some water and said, “Shit, we can win! We definitely can…”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Stop the bullshit and don’t waste time.” Jiang Cheng didn’t even give
        the Captain any face and just interrupted him. “Guo Xu, you rest. Switch
        in that person over there.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">“Who?” Wang Xu asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Him.” Jiang Cheng pointed to one of their substitute players, who
        although didn’t have any skills, was surprisingly quick on his feet.
        “Don’t do anything else and just keep a close eye on that one… who’s
        that, the smallest person on their team.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “This is Zhang Yuan,” Wang Xu said. “And the smallest one over there is
        Tang Xiwei.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, Zhang Yuan, keep an eye on Tang Xi,” Jiang Cheng said. “You’re fast
        so follow him, and you can break the rules. If you can’t block him, just
        push him but don’t make it so obvious. Don’t give him a chance to touch
        the ball, but if he has the ball in his hand, don’t touch him.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay,” Zhang Yuan nodded. “His name is Tang Xiwei, not Tang Wei.”<a
          href="#_ftn4"
          >[4]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        “I know,” Jiang Cheng responded. “It’s more advantageous for us if Tang
        Wei doesn’t get the ball since he has passed over half the balls that
        scored so far.”
      </p>

      <p>“Then, what about us?” Wang Xu asked.</p>

      <p>
        “That… Li Yata<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> has already broken the rules
        twice.” Jiang Cheng simply ignored him and looked at Gu Fei. “Let him do
        it once or twice more.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Gu Fei drank some water, “Li Ya… Dong.”</p>

      <p>“What about me?” Wang Xu asked a little more obviously this time.</p>

      <p>
        “Captain.” Jiang Cheng pulled his wrist guard, “If someone comes to
        interfere with me when I have the ball, you can deal with him…”
      </p>

      <p>“Alright! No problem!” Wang Xu patted his own chest.</p>

      <p>
        “Also, our returned defense is too slow,” Jiang Cheng said. “Didn’t we
        already practice this during our training… when the opponent goes into
        offense, we have to immediately return to our basket. Two at the
        three-second lane, everyone else, go to the three-point line and don’t
        let them get through.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Understood! Keep up that fighting spirit! What we practiced will be
        used now,” Wang Xu said and patted everyone’s shoulder, however, when he
        got to Jiang Cheng, he cautiously passed over him. He finally got to Gu
        Fei and patted his shoulder, “Da Fei, keep up that fighting spirit!”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Gu Fei glanced at him.</p>

      <p>“Water?” someone asked from beside Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        He turned his head and saw Yi Jing holding a bottle of water. First, she
        glanced at Gu Fei who was drinking water, and then she turned to look at
        Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Thanks.” Jiang Cheng took the bottle from her hand and twisted off the
        cap for a drink.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You guys played so well,” Yi Jing said in a small voice. “Everyone in
        the class was never this excited before.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng smiled but didn’t speak.</p>

      <p>
        Indeed, they played pretty well. His and Gu Fei’s forceful cooperation
        in acting cool could be very inspirational, but… it could also draw in
        hatred.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned to glance at Class 5 and saw several people staring at them
        with fire blazing in their eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Li Yata’s eyes met his, both his hands suddenly rose. He stuck out
        his middle fingers and pointed them in his direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        After giving him the finger, he didn’t withdraw his eyes and instead
        continued to viciously stare at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t react. He was rarely angry on the court since
        bringing in your emotions during a competition was a taboo.
      </p>

      <p>However, inciting your opponent was okay.</p>

      <p>
        After he looked face-to-face with the Tower for a while, he blew a kiss
        at him – the kind where the hand was kissed first before it was then
        blown over.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck your mother.” The Tower immediately became angry and swore.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng smiled, and ignored him.</p>

      <p>
        “I notice that you’re a real jerk,” Gu Fei whispered from behind him as
        they returned to the court.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Remember to make him get a foul,” Jiang Cheng said. “If he stays too
        long, it will be hard for us in the second half of the game.”
      </p>

      <p>“As you command,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        With less than seven minutes before the end of the first half, the ball
        was in the hands of Class 5. They had to widen the lead in that time
        then adjust themselves well in the second half so that the opponents
        wouldn’t be able to catch up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at the person that was preparing to toss the ball,
        and then took a mental note of what position the people on the court
        were.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zhang Yuan was pretty good. Li Yan No.2, no, Tang Xi… Tang Xi’s out of
        nowhere moves were very quick. When others targeted him, he could
        rapidly escape from them, but Zhang Yuan was like a bouncing jujube.
        Even when Tang Xi swayed left and right several times, he was unable to
        shake him off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 5 also had a method to their ball-playing. The jump ball was all
        passed to Tang Xi who would then organize a strategic offense, but since
        he couldn’t take the ball right now, and the rest of his team was
        completely overwhelmed by Class 8 in a one-to-one defense, the
        ball-handler didn’t actually know what to do.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a pressing five seconds, the person behind Jiang Cheng finally
        winded around him and rushed to get the ball. The ball-handler hurriedly
        threw the ball over but because it was still a slight distance away and
        had not flown halfway yet, Jiang Cheng rushed to intercept between them
        and took it.
      </p>

      <p>“The fuck!” Tang Xi shouted, “Are you fucking blind?!”</p>

      <p>
        As soon as Jiang Cheng got the ball, Gu Fei had already run toward the
        basket. He didn’t hold onto it for long, and immediately swung it
        firmly, sending the ball off to Lu Xiaobin outside of the three-point
        line.
      </p>

      <p>
        They had practiced this tactic during their training beforehand. Lu
        Xiaobin, who had a height advantage, caught the ball in the air and
        immediately after did a jump shot move and gave the ball over to Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei received the ball, but Class 5’s returned defense was still
        amazingly rapid; the Tower had already stopped in front of Gu Fei within
        just a matter of a few steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was prepared to provide support, but Wang Xu had already
        reached the three-second lane, and with no defense there for the time
        being, he could receive Gu Fei’s pass at any given moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        This series of reactions, this series of cooperation, made Jiang Cheng
        feel very gratified and think that if Wang Xu was to come over and pat
        his shoulder, he wouldn’t feel disgusted.
      </p>

      <p>
        But immediately after, Wang Xu shouted: “Da Fei, pass the ball! Da Fei,
        pass the ball!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng instantly had an urge to go over there and slap him. Right
        after he finished that sentence, the route to that pass was completely
        blocked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was fairly accurate in his shots, but with the Tower sticking so
        close like this, it was hard for him to do a layup – although not having
        the ball be snatched by the Tower was already pretty good.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt that it was too late to shoot for the basket, and even
        if he did it, it would be hard to score. With the Tower there, the
        rebound would not be easy to snatch either.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment, Gu Fei could either pass the ball or withdraw first.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Gu Fei suddenly made a posture as if to shoot for the basket
        instead.
      </p>

      <p>The Tower jumped, just a split second faster than Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei had only jumped after he did, and in that instant, for the sake
        of that tiny bit of time difference, Gu Fei kept his arm slightly down,
        and forcefully shot the ball out of his hands.
      </p>

      <p>The ball flew almost straight up and quickly spun into the basket.</p>

      <p>A burst of explosive shouts immediately sounded from all around.</p>

      <p>
        The referee’s whistle practically followed the ball into the basket at
        the same time: “No. 5, hacking foul!”<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a><sup></sup>
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng felt a series of shocks.</p>

      <p><em>Fuck!</em></p>

      <p>He scored even with that posture, at that angle!</p>

      <p>
        The bastard’s initial move to shoot for the basket was actually a feint!
      </p>

      <p>That Li Yata got a hacking foul!</p>

      <p>
        The scoring ball led to a foul and a penalty was added at the same time.
        Jiang Cheng almost wanted to roar together with the audience outside of
        the court.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei slowly retreated to the free-throw line<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>
        and extended three fingers at the Tower: “Three times.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” The Tower gritted his teeth and squeezed out that one word with
        a flushed face raging with anger.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was basically no suspense in whether or not Gu Fei could make the
        free throw, but who knew if he was showing off or wanted to provoke
        anger as he forcefully created suspense.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he raised the ball for the free throw, he turned his head to look
        straight at the Tower and then shot.
      </p>

      <p>Scored.</p>

      <p>
        The whole audience shrieked, with the girls’ shrieks nearly drowning out
        the boys’ applause and cheers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Fei. Although Gu Fei’s move was drop-dead
        gorgeous, his cockiness should also have a limit. He wanted to say
        something for Xiao Ta.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Aren’t you being cheap?”<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Jiang Cheng said when
        he returned to defense with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just learning from you. He can’t stand being provoked, you know. He’s
        already going crazy now,” Gu Fei said. “Look, we’re not even in the
        second half of the game and he’s going to get four fouls.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s judgment was correct. This Li Yadong… Jiang Cheng suddenly felt
        extremely pleased with himself for remembering his name. Li Yadong not
        only had an explosive temper but was also quite strong. Before, when
        Wang Xu had pressured him, he still managed to get two fouls, and now
        that he was in such a state of emotion, it would not be difficult to
        make him get a foul.
      </p>

      <p>
        If he was the Captain for Class 5, he would have replaced the player at
        that time, but it was obvious that Class 5 still relied on his ability
        to score and chose not to replace him.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the first half was about to end, Gu Fei had the ball. Just as he
        passed the center line, he was blocked by the Tower. Gu Fei didn’t even
        have to fake a move to lure him. He simply glanced at his hands and
        slightly leaned forward for the Tower to lose control and slap his hand.
      </p>

      <p>“No. 5, hacking foul!” the referee blew the whistle.</p>

      <p>
        “He’s about to graduate!”<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> someone in the
        audience shouted, and many others followed suit as they also heckled.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng could make out that the voice was Zhou Jing’s. He glanced
        over and saw Zhou Jing hiding behind Lao Xu.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of the first half, Li Yadong had four fouls. No matter how
        good he was, he wouldn’t play at the start of the second half and would
        definitely be left for the crucial moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        But right now, Class 5 had fallen behind them by 9 points. If Li Yadong
        did not take the court, the hope of recovering the score would be slim…
      </p>

      <p>What a struggle.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng drank some water.</p>

      <p>
        “As long as we continue to play like this in the second half, and at a
        steady pace, we can win!” Wang Xu said, “Think about it, not only will
        this be our first win, this will eliminate Class 5! Eliminate ah!
        Eliminating Class 5 means that the day we put Class 2 beneath our feet
        won’t be too far off!”
      </p>

      <p>Everyone nodded excitedly.</p>

      <p>
        “Are there any adjustments to our tactics?” Wang Xu asked Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Guo Xu get on, Zhang Yuan, you rest.” Jiang Cheng said. “Li Yadong
        shouldn’t be going up for a while and even if he is, he won’t stay for
        long. Tang Xi… Wei won’t be passing the ball to him all the time
        anymore. I suppose he will take the ball over himself. Leave him to me
        and everything else stays the same.”
      </p>

      <p>“Got it!” Wang Xu nodded.</p>

      <p>
        In the second half, Li Yadong did not play and was replaced by a team
        member that was about the same height as him, though he was thinner than
        him by a lot. This person’s jump was not as good as Li Yadong’s, so when
        Gu Fei did a layup, he was completely unable to block him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 8’s members all seemed to be on fire, truthfully, on fire was an
        inadequate description – it was simply the phoenix flame that set those
        on and off the court ablaze.<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        The audience also seemed to have taken drugs, probably from not having
        anticipated seeing such an unexpected match on the first day of the
        competition. Their shouts completely overwhelmed the entire area, and
        they didn’t know which side to support. In short, they shouted when they
        went on offense and shrieked when they scored, there was no difference
        between them – they were one in spirit.<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was a person who was not easily excited, especially during a
        game. As soon as he played defense, he needed to calmly observe – even
        if he wanted to act cool, he needed to rely on skills and not emotions.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now that the sidelines were shouting like there was a volcanic
        eruption, and a team like theirs could actually play to such a degree,
        he really couldn’t keep calm either.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The last quarter, the last quarter.” Lao Lu had somehow gotten his
        hands on the microphone again, and the referee couldn’t handle him
        anymore. He shouted like when he scolded in class, full of strength.
        “Stabilize! Don’t worry! Go steady and strike hard!!”
      </p>

      <p>
        There were only ten minutes left, and even with the additional overtime,
        it still wasn’t much. With Class 8 risking it all, and Class 5 also in
        the same circumstance, the score was not widened to a 15 points
        difference like Jiang Cheng had hoped – it was only 13 points at the
        moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 5 switched Li Yadong back into the game, and Jiang Cheng had the
        ball. If this ball could be guaranteed to be scored by Gu Fei, 15 points
        could psychologically destroy the team members in Class 5.
      </p>

      <p>
        He quickly passed the ball over to Guo Xu, who was ahead of him to the
        right, when Tang Xi came over to block him.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this moment, as if by the will of God, Guo Xu didn’t even hold onto
        the ball for long when he got it. When Tang Xi turned his head to look,
        he passed the ball from above back to Jiang Cheng, who had already
        passed by Tang Xi.
      </p>

      <p>“A beautiful pass!” Wang Xu roared.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took the ball and continued to advance forward, but Tang Xi
        was extremely quick, and blocked his path once more.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that second, Jiang Cheng wished that Tang Xi was in Class 8. That
        kind of speed and reaction… he glanced to the left, and as expected,
        Tang Xi tilted his body slightly over to that side; he was too
        emotionally excited, and the shortcoming of reacting too quickly lied
        precisely here.
      </p>

      <p><em>I just faked a move yo!</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng rushed over from the right with the ball and saw Gu Fei, who
        had entered the three-point line… and also coming from the right to
        intercept was Li Yadong’s foot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>What the hell! Fuck your uncle in the Southern Heavenly Gates!!</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stepped on Li Yadong’s foot with his left foot but couldn’t
        step forward with his right foot. His whole body suddenly lost balance
        and fell to the left.
      </p>

      <p>
        But before he fell to the ground, he gritted his teeth and swung the
        ball in his hand over to Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then he fell heavily on the ground and his elbow slid more than a meter
        away.
      </p>

      <p>
        The shouts from the surroundings heightened once more. He wasn’t sure if
        the screams and shouts were due to Gu Fei’s beautiful layup or that he
        fell hard, unable to stand for a few seconds.
      </p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng!” Wang Xu was anxious and rushed over.</p>

      <p>“Idiot.” Jiang Cheng pushed him, “Return to defense!”</p>

      <p>
        Class 5 started the ball relatively quickly, and Tang Xi had already
        passed by them at that moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Good no-call!”<a href="#_ftn12">[12]</a> Jiang Cheng shouted, “Wang Xu,
        return to defense!”
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck!” Wang Xu got up and ran over there.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stood up, and Gu Fei looked back at him. He shook his head,
        there was no problem with his feet —he had protection— but he fell on
        the injured rib from before and was a bit stunned.
      </p>

      <p>This ball, everyone held it with hot anger.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had just crossed the center line when Li Yadong, who had
        wanted to shoot for the basket, was kept in control by Gu Fei’s perfect
        block, and the ball was soon in the hands of Lu Xiaobin.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng——”Lu Xiaobin roared, full of aspiration and boldness as he
        passed the ball over to Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wasn’t sure if it was because they previously had a score of 5:4, but
        Class 5 believed that scoring these two points was a definite thing to
        solidify a win. When the ball was in Jiang Cheng’s hands, Tang Xi, who
        was the closest to him, was still at the three-point line of their
        team’s basket.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the ball in his hand, Jiang Cheng turned around and took a few
        steps, then stopped on his toes at the three-point line.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he prepared to make the shot, he glanced back at the few people in
        Class 5 who had rushed over and then calmly cast the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ball drew a long arc in the air – Jiang Cheng raised three fingers,
        and as the ball fell into the basket, he pressed his fingers down.
      </p>

      <p>Clean shot.</p>

      <p>Beautiful.</p>

      <p>
        In the sea of applause and cheers that erupted from the sidelines he
        could hear Lao Xu’s broken voice shouting “nice shot”. He glanced into
        the crowd of excited faces, and Lao Xu’s was the most conspicuous. He
        was so excited that his face was even redder than those who had actually
        played in the game.
      </p>

      <p>
        The score was widened to 16 points, and now there wasn’t much time left
        in the last quarter. Even without him and Gu Fei, the points were
        unlikely to be recovered.
      </p>

      <p>“Slow down.” Gu Fei glanced at the timer.</p>

      <p>
        In this case, there was no longer a need to rush to score. They could
        play even more steadily than before and the ball could leave their hands
        with the time calculated precisely.
      </p>

      <p>
        The people on Class 5 were already discouraged, and although each and
        every one of them was brimming with anger, there was no chance for them
        to explode.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei and Jiang Cheng controlled the ball and firmly pressed toward the
        basket. During this period, Class 5 scored four points, but Gu Fei gave
        up on the two points and passed the ball to Jiang Cheng twice to cast
        three-point shots instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng could feel the sound waves around him every time he made a
        three-point shot.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was never that smug when he played in the competitions for his
        previous school team.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, amid an atmosphere of extreme excitement, the whistle that
        ended the whole scene sounded.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei, who was holding the ball in his hand and was standing only a few
        steps from the three-point line, vigorously cast the ball toward the
        basket.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s not over!” Jiang Cheng looked at the ball that bounced on the
        backboard and entered the basket.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ahhhh——” Wang Xu’s voice was especially resounding in the space that
        was filled with cheers.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as Jiang Cheng turned his head, he saw him rush over with open
        arms, and without waiting for a reaction, he had already hugged Gu Fei
        and even kissed him fiercely on the face.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck off!” Gu Fei pushed him and then rubbed his face a few times.</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t touch me!” Jiang Cheng shouted and immediately pointed at him
        when he saw Wang Xu turn around.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ahh——” Wang Xu was undaunted by danger<a href="#_ftn13">[13]</a>
        as he pounced over, hugged, and kissed him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You fucker!” Jiang Cheng seemed to have been whipped as he made use of
        all his limbs to push Wang Xu aside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu didn’t care as he hugged and kissed all the players one by one
        in ecstasy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The whole class was wild with excitement and gathered around the court,
        grabbing onto people ‘till they turned into one screaming crowd. This
        kind of mood was probably only felt by this super weak chicken class
        that had never won any game in any school competition.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey,” Gu Fei came to him and spread open his arms. “I haven’t played
        such a cool ballgame in a long time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at him, hesitated, and then opened his arms to hug
        him. “Me too.”
      </p>

      <p>“Is your leg okay?” Gu Fei patted his back.</p>

      <p>“It’s fine,” Jiang Cheng smiled.</p>

      <p>This hug felt very… comfortable.</p>

      <p>
        Carrying tacit understanding and appreciation, as well as a “closeness”
        they had that was different from that with anybody else, even though the
        brief moment that Jiang Cheng brushed against Gu Fei had the face from
        the night when Gu Fei was practically glued to him flashed before his
        eyes, and the face of Gu Fei who donned a halo beneath the sunlight
        followed after… he still felt calm.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know why he would describe a hug as ‘calm’, but this was
        really the first time he was in such close contact with someone aside
        from Pan Zhi in a very long time.
      </p>

      <p>He could even feel the tip of his hair sweep Gu Fei’s face.</p>

      <p>However, there was no awkwardness or resistance.</p>

      <p>
        “Go, go, go,” Lao Xu excitedly waved his arm after the people in the
        class dispersed. “Lao Lu and I are taking you all out for dinner. We’ll
        treat you to something good!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I want to eat hot pot,” Wang Xu said. “No, I want to eat grilled meat…
        ah, Mongolian fire pot isn’t bad either…”
      </p>

      <p>
        A group of people followed Lao Xu and Lao Lu to go out, with the feeling
        of their blood boiling in their veins hadn’t yet passed; at this moment,
        it was all spent on discussing what to eat.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Umm, there’s something I want to ask you.” Gu Fei and Jiang Cheng
        walked side by side.
      </p>

      <p>“En, what is it?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“Do you want to make money?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“Ah?” Jiang Cheng froze and looked at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei suddenly asking “do you want to make money” without rhyme or
        reason made him immediately think of a mommy talking to an ignorant
        girl.
      </p>

      <p>He almost wanted to say, “No, I’m still young”.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        “I said, you…” Gu Fei seemed to be distracted by his ‘ah’ and didn’t
        know how to put it, “Do you want to make a bit of pocket change?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En?” Jiang Cheng looked at him, <em>pocket change</em>? For some reason
        that sounded rather strange.
      </p>

      <p>“Just… take some pictures and stuff…” Gu Fei explained.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng knew that Gu Fei couldn’t possibly introduce him to anything
        weird. But at this moment, his brain was lacking adequate blood supply
        just right after that intense ballgame, and he was caught in a spiraling
        thought of “this is a trap with evil intentions”, unable to free himself
        for quite some time. Finally, he blurted out, “I’m a decent person.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How is this the intelligence of a xueba?” Gu Fei honestly couldn’t help
        himself, “You must have actually gone to Special-Ed school before,
        right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh!” Jiang Cheng finally returned to his senses, “Take photos? What
        kind of photos?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nudes,” Gu Fei gestured irritably. He lit a cigarette and kept on
        walking, “We’ll talk again when you’re awake.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m awake now…” Jiang Cheng glanced at the cigarette hanging in his
        mouth and froze. He knew that Gu Fei frequently smoked in the bathroom
        in between classes, but he didn’t expect him to just light up one in the
        middle of the sports field in broad daylight.
      </p>

      <p>“Want one?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “No.” Jiang Cheng decisively refused. Although he and Pan Zhi had also
        hid in the bathroom to smoke sometimes, generally speaking, they were
        not decent people.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What photos?” Wang Xu, who was walking ahead, suddenly turned his head.
        “Did someone take photos of us… ah, of course, someone did. We were so
        handsome today! Let’s check the school forum tonight. There must be all
        kinds of poses… ay, but it’s probably all of you two…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll get someone to come just for the purpose of taking photos of you
        for the next match,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you for real?” Wang Xu laughed, “That’s enough, don’t tease me…”
      </p>

      <p>“Gu Fei—” someone called from behind them.</p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ooohh</em>.” Wang Xu looked up, “Your Excellency, the class
        representative.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng turned his head and saw Yi Jing running over with a small
        bag in her hand.
      </p>

      <p>“You called me?” Gu Fei also turned.</p>

      <p>
        “This…” Yi Jing handed the bag to Jiang Cheng. “I just got these from
        the infirmary, rubbing alcohol and stuff. You fell during the game,
        right? You should check it out later.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng was a bit taken aback. He did feel a slight burning
        sensation on his elbow, but today, they had all worn T-shirts under
        their uniforms. And when he fell, his sleeves separated his elbow from
        the ground so it shouldn’t be anything that serious. He took the bag,
        “Thanks.”
      </p>

      <p>“No problem.” Yi Jing smiled.</p>

      <p>
        “Why did you call Gu Fei’s name when you wanted to give something to
        Jiang Cheng?” Wang Xu had a meaningful smile on his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I couldn’t remember Jiang Cheng’s name for a second.” Yi Jing brushed
        at her hair, slightly embarrassed before she turned to leave.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu <em>tsk</em>-ed at her back. “Only remembers Gu Fei’s name,
        huh?”
      </p>

      <p>“She only didn’t remember Jiang Cheng’s name,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu and Lao Lu were pretty generous; the game today probably exceeded
        their expectations to such an extent that they actually called for
        several taxis to take the group to a barbeque buffet.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Xu-<em>zong</em>.” Gu Fei stopped Lao Xu at the entrance, “It’s too
        expensive here. Let’s go to a normal restaurant instead.More
        importantly, it’s just a gathering and shouldn’t have to be anything
        big.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What gathering?” Lao Lu spoke from the side, “It’s a celebration! Gu
        Fei, you go in. Don’t worry about this, your Xu Zong and I can pay for
        this much.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What a good boy!” Lao Xu grabbed Gu Fei’s arm with a touched expression
        on his face. “What a good boy! You know how to be considerate of your
        teacher! I just knew that you…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… can still be saved.” Gu Fei helped finish his sentence, then turned
        around and went inside the restaurant.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng followed in from behind, holding back his laughter.</p>

      <p>
        The restaurant had a huge private room that probably didn’t get used
        much, which was perfect for the large group of them to go in.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go get some food.” Lao Xu propped himself on the table as if he was in
        class. You can eat enough to satisfy your cravings, and you can even get
        some alcohol, but I’ll have to approve how much you can drink.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Hearing that, everyone squeezed out all at once to go get their food.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took off his coat and was just about to look at his elbow
        when his cellphone sounded.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took it out for a glance and saw that it was a notification for the
        auto-payment of the current month’s phone bill for a hundred yuan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Normally, he wouldn’t think that a hundred yuan was much, but now that
        he looked at the notification, he felt a slight twinge in his heart.
        Should he switch to a cheaper plan? But then there wouldn’t be enough
        data, and also, Li Baoguo’s place didn’t have Wi-Fi… maybe get an
        Ethernet cable? But that would also mean more spending.
      </p>

      <p>
        He frowned. Although he had money in his card; nonetheless, he was still
        made uneasy by this state of constantly having no income at all. Li
        Baoguo had only provided him with a room and nothing else. Now, he even
        had to go out and buy food once a week to keep in the fridge for him to
        make something to eat on the daily.
      </p>

      <p>He sighed and walked out of the private room to get some food.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was in front of him, holding a plate in his hands as he looked at
        the meat in the rows of freezers before him, seemingly in a daze.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng walked over to stand beside him. He also picked up a plate
        and a pair of tongs, and in just a few grabs, pork belly, fatty beef,
        and fatty lamb all piled up on the plate. Then he stacked his plate on
        top of Gu Fei’s and picked up another one and continued: pork belly,
        fatty beef…
      </p>

      <p>“How do you maintain your figure?” Gu Fei looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “I go running when the weather is warm,” Jiang Cheng said. “And it’s not
        like I eat like this all the time.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Gu Fei responded.</p>

      <p>
        “What you just said… about the photos.” Jiang Cheng looked around, there
        were no classmates nearby. “What was that all about?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s Xin-<em>jie.</em>” Gu Fei hesitated for a long while with the
        tongs in his hand then picked up a few shrimps and piled them on the
        plate. “She has a shop that sells menswear and she’s looking for someone
        to take some photos.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah,” Jiang Cheng thought about it. “Don’t these shops normally have
        their own regular models?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just one regular and the others are all temporary hires. The regular
        has something to do,” Gu Fei said. “There are new goods that came in the
        last couple of days, but no one to take photos of them. She asked me to
        help her look for a suitable person.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I see,” Jiang Cheng was a bit hesitant. “I’m completely inexperienced,
        is that okay?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s not a problem, you have the face and the figure, and you’re also
        photogenic,” Gu Fei said. “Liu Fan helped out with the photos before. If
        he can do it, it definitely won’t be a problem for you.”
      </p>

      <p>“What kind of clothes?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I’ll show you in a bit.” Gu Fei lifted his chin toward the food
        counter, “Help me get a bit of vegetables. I can’t take it if it’s all
        meat.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng took a small basket and filled it with veggies.</p>

      <p>
        When they got to the private room, everyone had already returned from
        getting food, and the room was piping hot from the steam.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as they entered, Lao Xu picked up a glass of wine and stood up.
        “Come, our saviors, have a seat. I have something to say.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After Jiang Cheng and Gu Fei sat down, Lao Xu raised his glass.
        “Everyone worked hard today. I had you since sophomore year, of course
        some from junior year… our Class 8 ah, we don’t even rank in the daily
        morning exercise routine competition<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> but today,
        we can hold our heads up high! It hasn’t been easy! I believe that with
        your current abilities, entering the finals will not be a problem!
        Fighting! Come, let’s drink!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Everybody picked up their glasses and cheered with dissonant clangs.
      </p>

      <p>
        They had barely taken a sip when Lao Xu started again: “We also have to
        thank classmates Gu Fei and Jiang Cheng for their efforts today…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Lao Xu, Lao Xu,” Lao Lu called out twice, “That’s enough. Let them eat
        first, they’re all hungry. You’re going to put yourself in tears being
        this emotional.”
      </p>

      <p>“Drink!” Wang Xu tilted his head back and emptied his glass.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at the glasses that all contained beer, and only Lao
        Xu and Lao Lu’s held liquor.
      </p>

      <p>He followed with a couple of gulps.</p>

      <p>
        “Tomorrow is the girls’ competition,” Wang Xu said. “I wonder how it’ll
        go.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Not a chance. Don’t our girls always get on the court just to lose the
        match and complete the task? The ball goes flying once they start, and
        none of them like to play basketball anyway,” Guo Xu said.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a collective ensemble of sighs for the girls’ team before
        everyone then went back to discussing the upcoming matches.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Look,” Gu Fei browsed through his phone and then passed it over to
        Jiang Cheng. “They’re mostly in this style, pretty niche…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took the phone and swiped through some of the photos that
        were all of Liu Fan – the shots were pretty cool. As he swiped to the
        next few photos, they were of another person, probably Ding Zhuxin’s
        regular model. He could definitely see the difference if comparing them
        side to side.
      </p>

      <p>“Steampunk?”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “There are others as well, with all kinds of retro nostalgia,” Gu Fei
        said. “What do you think? The payment can be by a single piece or by day
        which is based on professional models’ rate. And since she is in a rush
        to shoot, it could be more than usual.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng hardly hesitated, after all, it was money. He nodded his
        head, “Okay.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll tell her then. We don’t have any matches for the next two days, so
        we can go shoot in the afternoon and evening,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng looked at the photos once more, “Does anyone actually
        buy these clothes? They’d be surrounded and stared at for sure if they
        went out like this. If they’re even a bit complacent about it, they
        might even get beaten up…”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei laughed, “You even worry about this for them?”</p>

      <p>“That’s right, I’m kind-hearted like that,” Jiang Cheng stated.</p>

      <p>
        The management at Si Zhong was pretty lenient. With matches initiating
        in the early afternoon, those that wanted to go, and watch didn’t even
        attend classes and crowded onto the sports field, and those that left,
        no one even took notice.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, Jiang Cheng still gave Lao Xu a call. He said that the fall
        from the day before had caused some pain and he needed to get it checked
        out at the hospital. Lao Xu approved and even casually lamented that a
        good student was as good as what was expected of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, Jiang Cheng had never asked for leave in the past when he
        didn’t go to school. But with Lao Xu being the mother-hen type of
        homeroom teacher who liked to spread his wings and cluck at them all day
        long, he felt that Lao Xu would be a bit pitiful if he didn’t say
        something.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The place is a bit far, but it is only a bus ride away.” Gu Fei took
        Jiang Cheng to the bus stop. “Her studio doubles as a warehouse and a
        bedroom that has a small photography set.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p>
        He was a little nervous. He wouldn’t even be nervous if someone asked
        him to take their exams for them to earn money, but modeling for photos…
        this type of thing that he had never thought of was a bit far from his
        comfort zone.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they got on the bus, he noticed that what Gu Fei carried was not
        his school bag but a rather heavy-looking bag instead. “What are you
        carrying?”
      </p>

      <p>“Camera, lenses.” Gu Fei went to sit in the very last row.</p>

      <p>“You’re… taking the photos?” Jiang Cheng froze.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei pulled his sleeve a little and dragged him to the side seat
        before an uncle squeezed over to sit down.
      </p>

      <p>“<em>You </em>are taking the photos?” Jiang Cheng asked once more.</p>

      <p>
        “Yes, yes.” Gu Fei looked at him, “I’m taking the photos. Is that
        strange or something? It’s not like I haven’tphotographed you before.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I didn’t mean that. I just thought that she had her own photographer,”
        Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, it wasn’t strange knowing that Gu Fei would shoot the photos.
        He had seen Gu Fei’s photos before, and Gu Fei had also shared them
        often in his Moments; they were indeed very professionally photographed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ding Zhuxin has her own photographer, but she asks me when it gets too
        busy,” Gu Fei said. “I’ve always helped people take photos though.”
      </p>

      <p>“… ah.” Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>Once the bus started to move, Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything else.</p>

      <p>
        The heated bus shook and moved exasperatingly slowly. Beside his ears
        were sounds of people talking and laughing, and while the people in the
        bus stayed in place, the scenery outside the window constantly changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was the time where one would be harrowed by an unusual drowsiness
        and the need to sleep, especially in the afternoon, when the eyes
        started to scuffle with you from looking at the warm sun.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei also kept silent. Jiang Cheng glanced over at him and found that
        he was holding his arms with his eyes closed.
      </p>

      <p><em>Sleepy.</em></p>

      <p>
        At first, he could hold it back for a while but seeing that Gu Fei had
        actually fallen asleep already, he felt his own eyes no longer capable
        of remaining open. He pulled up the hood of his coat over his head and
        also closed his eyes, letting his head hang low.
      </p>

      <p>
        But saying that he was sleepy didn’t mean that he could fall asleep just
        like that. He was in a daze the entire time, surrounded by vague sounds
        and shadows that constantly flitted by.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t know how long he was in that state of
        half-consciousness, until he felt a bit of weight on his shoulder. He
        lifted his hood and found that Gu Fei’s head was unknowingly leading
        against his shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei’s eyelashes were pretty long, but not as thick as Gu Miao’s.</p>

      <p>
        Although he didn’t have any motive toward Gu Fei, especially with Ding
        Zhuxin feasibly being Gu Fei’s girlfriend…… at this moment, he felt an
        inexplicable itch in his heart, nevertheless.
      </p>

      <p>
        This itch that spread from his shoulder, felt like down feathers that
        had been fluffed up in the sunlight, and gradually caressed the rest of
        his body.
      </p>

      <p>He closed his eyes again.</p>

      <p>
        The feeling of loneliness, he had always been able to taste it ever
        since the day he realized that the attractiveness of men was greater to
        him than that of women, and when the days where he could only strictly
        keep the secret to himself started.
      </p>

      <p>This feeling of loneliness appeared from time to time.</p>

      <p>
        Pan Zhi knew his secret but wasn’t able to alleviate him of the pressure
        that came with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he had a family, parents and a brother, classmates and friends,
        though this loneliness existed, he did not feel it as profoundly.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was only after he arrived here that they overlapped and pressed
        together little by little.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t need the allies, didn’t need those of the same kind who
        casually nestled together to keep warm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though it was an objective attraction, Gu Fei, and Gu Fei’s unconscious
        position now.
      </p>

      <p>Gave him the illusion of the warmth of ‘two people”.</p>

      <p>He wasn’t exactly sure what this taste was.</p>

      <p>
        “Stop requested.” Gu Fei raised his head after the stop was announced.
        “It’s the next one.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He froze for a couple of seconds when he saw Jiang Cheng’s shoulder, and
        then said: “Sorry. I’m too sleepy.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s okay.” Jiang Cheng stretched out his shoulder, “You’re too tired
        from acting all cool yesterday.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei laughed and stood up, “Let’s go.”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng followed. He had only dozed off for a moment, yet his legs
        felt soft at the knees when he walked… perhaps, he was too fierce the
        day before, especially since he hadn’t had that much exercise since
        winter began.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the wind blew when they got off the bus, the feeling of having no
        strength in his whole body gradually waned.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ding Zhuxin’s studio that doubled as a warehouse and bedroom, and had a
        small photography set, was on a very artistic street; the kind that had
        all sorts of graffiti on the street, and all kinds of drawings and
        paintings on the manhole, telephone booths and matching circuit boxes.
        There were small stores with renovations on either side of the streets
        that would make anybody who wanted to act pretentious and couldn’t act
        pretentious enough be afraid to enter in case they lose their shit.
      </p>

      <p>
        This street was not long or grand, but Jiang Cheng was still rather
        surprised that a place like this could still exist in such a rundown and
        crappy little city.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took him into a building that was similar to a small office
        building. It appeared quite old on the outside, but looking at the
        signage plates on the wall, the names of the companies here were
        striving in a direction that made people unable to comprehend.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at the names while they waited for the elevator but
        couldn’t exactly make sense of any of them; the ones in roman alphabets,
        he didn’t know which country they belonged to, and the Chinese
        characters also didn’t seem to follow the usual order at first glance.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What is this place, each and every one of them seem so full of
        themselves that they can’t even be fucking pulled back by steel cables.”
        He couldn’t help but say when it was only him and Gu Fei in the
        elevator.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This area is called the ‘‘90s Convergence.” Gu Fei leaned against the
        enclosure and laughed. “It was meant to be a place where young people
        could gather, the really trendy and fashionable ones, but it kind of
        steered a bit away from that. No one but pretentious pricks come here
        now, however, the rent is pretty cheap.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Ding Zhuxin was waiting in the studio, and the moment the two walked in,
        she smiled. “I knew you would call him over.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Reaallly…” Gu Fei threw the bag he carried on the floor. “We’re all
        acquainted so there’s no need for introductions.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Have a bit of this.” Ding Zhuxin brought over a pot of fruit tea and
        poured a cup for Jiang Cheng. “I made it myself and added a bunch of
        random things. It’s actually pretty good.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Thanks.” Jiang Cheng accepted the cup and looked around the studio.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was a mess, with fabrics and posters everywhere along with several
        large unopened parcels that most likely contained clothes. But through
        this mess, he could still perceive that the very foundation was still
        the largely cold and industrial style that consisted of concrete walls,
        concrete lighting, exposed red bricks, and intertwining water pipes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s get started.” Gu Fei laid down on the sofa, “Let him see the
        clothes first.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Come.” Ding Zhuxin took Jiang Cheng to the racks of hangers and pointed
        at the clothes hanging on them, “The style this time is ‘back to the
        basics’, all knitted…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Knitted?” Gu Fei interrupted her. “You had me find a ‘bad boy’ for this
        style?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Knitted material.” Ding Zhuxin leaned against the rack, “The design
        follows a ‘bad boy’ style, though it can be a bit difficult for the
        model…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Ding Zhuxin looked at Jiang Cheng up and down, “But he can manage it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Whatever you say.” Gu Fei sat up, opened his bag, and began to prepare
        the camera.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s strive for 30 sets today,” Ding Zhuxin said. “What do you think?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… okay.” Jiang Cheng looked at the clothes on the racks that were just
        hanging there in a row like that. Apart from the so-called knitted
        garments, he couldn’t discern any of the designs that Ding Zhuxin had
        mentioned at all; there were just a lot of long garments.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, he had never worn anything that he had always thought was
        normally worn by older and middle-aged, long-haired artists.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go change.” Gu Fei walked over and said, “The undergarments have all
        been matched already. You just have to change into them.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You…” Jiang Cheng turned his head around, but before he could speak, Gu
        Fei raised the camera and clicked the shutter. <em>Click, click.</em> “…
        bastard.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just change.” Gu Fei pointed to a room to the side, “We’ll be shooting
        in there in a bit. She will tell you what kind of feeling she wants for
        the poses. I promise to make you look… very handsome.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng responded and then looked at the clothes on the racks.
        “I can choose any one of these?”
      </p>

      <p>“Any,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng responded once more. He took off his coat and tossed
        it on the chair to the side but was somewhat embarrassed when he was
        about to take off his clothes. It was fine that Gu Fei was standing to
        the side with his camera but Ding Zhuxin was also standing there holding
        her elbow and sipping tea while staring at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wouldn’t have felt anything if it was a jacket that he had to change
        into, but when he looked at all the sets, he basically had to strip down
        to his underwear.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei turned to glance at Ding Zhuxin and gestured with his hand.</p>

      <p>
        Ding Zhuxin smiled and turned into the small room to the side. “Come in
        after you’ve changed. You have a good foundation so simple makeup should
        be enough. Da Fei can tweak them a bit later.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I have to wear makeup?” Jiang Cheng asked as he took off his clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei raised the camera toward him and looked at Jiang Cheng’s
        well-proportioned torso through the lens. It was indeed a body that had
        always been trained – very well-toned. “If we don’t apply any, your face
        will be dark.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Can you not point that thing at me?” Jiang Cheng clutched his belt and
        looked at the camera.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Starting from right now until tonight,” Gu Fei still had the camera
        raised, “This thing will be pointed at you the entire time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took off his pants somewhat reluctantly and said while
        changing into the clothes: “I’m telling you, it’s only because of the
        money that I haven’t already smacked you.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei laughed.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s legs were rather straight and were as toned as his upper
        body. He looked through the lens at Jiang Cheng, who had changed into
        the upper garment. “You’re actually pretty fitting for this style.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No way,” Jiang Cheng said and looked down suspiciously. “I’ve lived for
        almost 18 years and haven’t worn anything like this before.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t speak as he retreated a few steps.</p>

      <p>
        Ding Zhuxin’s eye for people was always pretty accurate. As soon as
        Jiang Cheng changed into these clothes, the aura around his whole person
        seemed to have changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        He always felt that regardless of gender, whoever put on a long-knitted
        jacket could pick up a bowl and go begging on the street.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when Jiang Cheng put on the jacket, and turned his face to look at
        him, Gu Fei’s breath stopped at that moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        This air about him, it was truly not something he normally saw in the
        people around him.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt that he had quite the skill to be able to pick such an
        inexplicable outfit without much thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        The outfit itself was pretty good-looking if you ignored the jacket:
        slim-fitted pants and a loose black T-shirt, and although it was also
        that of knitted material, at the very least it was the kind that
        wouldn’t lure the masses to gape at when worn outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as soon as he put this jacket on, he froze and looked back at Gu
        Fei. “Hey, are you sure I didn’t get the wrong clothes?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah.” Gu Fei was still looking at him from behind the camera. “What’s
        wrong?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nothing, but don’t you think that this looks like a knitted version of
        the one from the Matrix? No, no, isn’t it more like a missionary style
        if I wrap a woven rope around my waist?” Jiang Cheng pulled up the
        clothes and said in a small voice, “Is there a mirror? I feel like a
        Master of the Law…”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t respond and only laughed and pointed at the back wall.
      </p>

      <p>
        This jacket was quite long, enough to reach all the way down to his
        calf, and the material was relatively thin and soft, giving off a
        loose-fitting appearance when worn. It was the legendary lax and casual
        style. However, if it was worn outside by a shorter and skinnier person,
        they would certainly be caught and taken back to the mental hospital<a
          href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This requires the right face, body, height, and presence,” Ding Zhuxin
        said, leaning against the door. “You have a better vibe when you wear
        this than Da Fei. If he wore it, he would only look like a delinquent.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh, even if he doesn’t wear this, he’s essentially a delinquent.” Jiang
        Cheng stood in front of the mirror and looked at himself. It was
        actually… okay. Even though he would never buy these kinds of clothes,
        he wasn’t picking for himself at the moment. “Whoever the designer for
        this is, I have to give them a smile.”
      </p>

      <p>“It’s me,” Ding Zhuxin said.</p>

      <p>
        “… huh?” Jiang Cheng froze and looked over to see Ding Zhuxin’s
        expression of “I know what you’re thinking”, the familiar feeling of
        embarrassment suddenly sprung up unbidden, rising steeply from the
        ground. And, when he followed her into the small room, his limbs were
        moving a bit ipsilaterally.<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a><sup></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        When Ding Zhuxin applied makeup on his face, Gu Fei was switching on all
        the light sources on the photography set.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t worry, just casually move around.” Ding Zhuxin said as she swept
        the brush on his face a few times, “All done.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stood on the spot where the photo was to be taken as she
        instructed. The set itself was actually pretty cool but he didn’t know
        what to do after he got on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s take a few steps back and forth.” Gu Fei aimed the camera toward
        him, “Just move from left to right and then right to left.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng nodded and turned to the side. As soon as he moved,
        and the camera in Gu Fei’s hands clicked, he could not help but turn his
        head. “You took a shot already? I feel like I walked weirdly<a
          href="#_ftn4"
          >[4]</a
        >
        just now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just walk, and don’t worry about whether or not I’ve taken a shot.” Gu
        Fei clicking the shutter again.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng took a deep breath then walked from left to right.</p>

      <p>
        With the area where the photography set was placed being only a few
        square meters, getting to the end didn’t take that many steps. He turned
        around and walked back from right to left.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Lower your head as you walk,” Gu Fei said while clicking. “Go a bit
        faster, with larger strides.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng lowered his head slightly and walked across once more.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei stared at him through the lens and took a series of shots.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s figure was fixed in the frame, with his head lowered, his
        legs making large strides, and the corner of the lower hem of his jacket
        slightly fluttering… dynamic and breathtaking.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Put the hood on,” Ding Zhuxin said. “The hood also needs to give
        prominence to the design.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng pulled over on the hood of the jacket and walked
        forward while adjusting it. “Now I feel like the grim reaper…”
      </p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng,” Gu Fei called out to him.</p>

      <p>“En?” Jiang Cheng turned his head around.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei quickly clicked the shutter.</p>

      <p>
        It was the same striding forward post: his raised hands and the edge of
        the hood concealed half of his face, and only his eyes that were hidden
        in the shadow and the bridge of his straight nose were visible.
      </p>

      <p>“That was a great shot,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“Face forward,” Ding Zhuxin said while sipping her tea.</p>

      <p>
        “There’s no need to smile or make any expression.” Gu Fei glanced at
        Jiang Cheng, “There’s also no need for any movements either.”
      </p>

      <p>
        It would be difficult for the average person to hold this kind of stance
        that held no facial expression or movements, and arms hung to the side
        without looking stupid. Gu Fei didn’t know why he had asked Jiang Cheng,
        a person who was not a professional and had nothing to do with
        modelling, to use this posture.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wouldn’t that look stupid?” Jiang Cheng sighed and stood as he had
        instructed.
      </p>

      <p>“No,” Gu Fei answered simply and clicked the shutter.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng must have grown up showing off his good looks shamelessly<a
          href="#_ftn5"
          >[5]</a
        >, seeing as he was actually able to handle such an idiotic stance like
        this.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was no tension as if he was standing at attention, nor was there a
        deliberate uneasiness to relax oneself.
      </p>

      <p>
        His center of gravity was slightly shifted to the right leg, and his
        shoulder was naturally relaxed – this was very important. Those that
        didn’t know how to stand properly would either overly stretch back their
        shoulders or hunch forward unnecessarily…
      </p>

      <p>
        This kid must have practiced standing in front of the mirror before; the
        tall and straight, and casualness of his posture… made his long arms and
        legs appeared relaxed and content.
      </p>

      <p>“Lift your chin a bit,” Ding Zhuxin said, “Be a bit arrogant.”</p>

      <p>“Arrogant… how?”</p>

      <p>“When you first walked into Class 8,” Gu Fei said. “Like that.”</p>

      <p>
        “I was annoyed then.” Jiang Cheng recalled the time he had stood there
        like a complete idiot to accept the whole class inspection, and
        immediately felt some of that annoyance return.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei clicked the shutter, and after a few more clicks, he finally put
        down the camera. “You should consider this profession if you ever run
        out of options.”<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s that supposed to mean, why does he have to be out of options to
        consider doing this?” Ding Zhuxin laughed and said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “He’s a xueba,” Gu Fei said. “Unlike you and your group of ex-dropouts.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Move aside.” Ding Zhuxin clapped her hands and hammered on the arm.
        “Jiang Cheng, go change into another one, the one piece.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Which one?” Jiang Cheng took off the jacket and asked as he walked out.
      </p>

      <p>“That one piece, the long pullover.” Ding Zhuxin said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng went out, but Gu Fei stayed behind and looked through the
        photos that he had just taken one by one.
      </p>

      <p>
        If he had to name something about Jiang Cheng that especially attracted
        him… excluding stuff like being a xueba, playing the tin-whistle,
        skilled with a slingshot, and such, it would precisely be this demeanour
        of his. You could call him a bad boy, you could say that he was
        hot-tempered, even contemptuous – it all worked; there was a type of
        arrogance embedded in his bones that made people concede to him, an
        attitude that said ‘<em
          >laozi<a href="#_ftn7"><strong>[7]</strong></a></em
        >
        is <em>just</em> that awesome’.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to everything else, this intuitive and straightforward
        attraction was the most powerful thing | it did not require you to
        uncover or perceive it – you needed only to look at it.
      </p>

      <p>Looking was enough.</p>

      <p>Visual animals are superficial like that.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei sighed softly – all he could do was look.</p>

      <p>
        He could no longer remember how long it had been since he last was in
        the mindset to spare a single glance at those around him that came and
        went, those that remained and those that stayed.
      </p>

      <p>Dating young must be put to an end.</p>

      <p>
        He wasn’t in the mood, but he also didn’t dare to – everything that he
        protected just couldn’t bear any instability.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Excuse me,” Jiang Cheng came in lifting a linen-coloured outfit. “Is it
        this one?”
      </p>

      <p>“Yes,” Ding Zhuxin nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “I wanted to ask, how do you wear this?” Jiang Cheng spread open the
        garment, held it by the shoulder, and shook it. “And what do I wear on
        the inside?”
      </p>

      <p>“Underwear,” Ding Zhuxin said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng shook the garment in his hand again with question marks of
        all sizes written in the expression across his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei turned his head and used the camera to obstruct his own face as
        he tried his best to hold back his laughter, thinking he could almost
        hear the desperate cry in Jiang Cheng’s heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        This garment was a very thinly knitted pullover that was rather long in
        length and looked like it could reach down to Jiang Cheng’s knees; the
        neckline was unnecessarily large as well. Gu Fei had seen this design
        before but had always thought that Ding Zhuxin had designed it for
        herself. He didn’t anticipate that it was actually menswear.
      </p>

      <p>“Go change,” Ding Zhuxin said. “It should look good on you.”</p>

      <p>
        “It’s hollow at the center?” Jiang Cheng stated, unwilling to give up.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s right,” Ding Zhuxin said. “You got abs? If you don’t, I can help
        draw it for you.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng’s expression remained incomprehensible.</p>

      <p>“Does he?” Ding Zhuxin turned to ask Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        “Ah?” Gu Fei turned his head around, without having a chance to restrain
        the smile on his face. “I think so.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go change then. I thought you were afraid of being embarrassed because
        you didn’t have abs.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng nodded his head like he had decided something, but
        after he walked out, he poked his head back in. “Xin-jie, I’m just
        asking but do people actually buy these clothes?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Of course,” Ding Zhuxin sipped her tea, “All my designs sell pretty
        well.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How wondrous. What kind of people buy them?” Jiang Cheng said in a
        small voice.
      </p>

      <p>“Crazy people, probably,” Ding Zhuxin said.</p>

      <p>
        Once he stripped until he was only left in his underpants and put on the
        garment that was practically the same as a torn fishnet, Jiang Cheng
        felt that it was no different from being naked. He quickly walked over
        to the mirror for a glance.
      </p>

      <p><em>Oh, my God —</em><em></em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng firmly believed that if this garment could be sold, it could
        only be attributed to his own figure being just too fucking good…
      </p>

      <p>He clenched his teeth and walked back in.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei had his head down and was fiddling with the camera, but as soon
        as he looked up and saw him, he immediately whistled.
      </p>

      <p>“Shut up you,” Jiang Cheng pointed at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Good thing the underpants is black.” Ding Zhuxin closely scrutinized
        his whole figure and said with great satisfaction, “I was even thinking
        of finding you a black one if it wasn’t… let’s start.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng walked over to the set only to see that part of it had
        been replaced, appearing even more fresh and cool than before.
      </p>

      <p>“Take your shoes off. Barefoot only,” Ding Zhuxin said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t have the strength to resist while wearing such
        clothes; he simply took off his shoes and socks without a word and stood
        barefoot in the centre.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This outfit doesn’t require much movement,” Ding Zhuxin said. “The name
        of this piece is ‘Soundless’. Try to find a feeling for it.”
      </p>

      <p><em>Silence.</em></p>

      <p>
        That was the only thing Jiang Cheng could think of at this moment based
        on the word.
      </p>

      <p>And as for the feeling.</p>

      <p>
        He felt a little cold… the outfit was completely covered in holes after
        all. Not to mention that Ding Zhuxin could make out that the underpants
        were black, she probably saw exactly what fucking brand it was.
      </p>

      <p>But he had to unearth the feeling, nonetheless.</p>

      <p>
        Ding Zhuxin paid him to take these photos – she was his employer. He had
        to find this so-called feeling, and besides, Gu Fei had also been
        holding the camera waiting for him.
      </p>

      <p><em>Silence.</em></p>

      <p><em>Okay, not silence. Soundless.</em></p>

      <p><em>The absence of sound.</em></p>

      <p><em>Pure peacefulness.</em></p>

      <p>
        He somehow remembered a Russian song that he used to be very fond of.
      </p>

      <p>Тихо, тихо, тихо, тихотактаетвночи……<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a></p>

      <p>
        <em>Quietly, quietly, quietly, quietly clinging for a long time…</em>
      </p>

      <p>The whole song made one feel calm.</p>

      <p>
        After a quarrel with his family, he often put on headphones to listen to
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        With his eyes closed, he would listen to the lyrics that he didn’t
        understand and hear the voice in his heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>That was a hell of a long way to go… </em>he had to search all the
        way in Siberia for such a feeling…
      </p>

      <p>
        In the frame, Jiang Cheng closed his eyes and placed his right hand
        gently on the left side of his chest.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei clicked the shutter.</p>

      <p>
        At this moment, Jiang Cheng gave off the feeling of being very far away,
        enclosed by a deep sense of distance.
      </p>

      <p>Confusion and stubbornness written in the silent placidity.</p>

      <p>
        After he clicked the shutter, he kept the camera lifted for a long time
        without moving as he looked through the lens, transfixed by Jiang
        Cheng’s face.
      </p>

      <p>… until Ding Zhuxin lightly cleared her throat.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng opened his eyes as if he had been awakened, and as his hand
        came down, his finger got caught on the collar. He gently pulled it away
        which caused it to bounce back.
      </p>

      <p>
        The shutter of the camera in Gu Fei’s hand sounded with a series of
        clicks.
      </p>

      <p>
        The faint perplexity in Jiang Cheng’s eyes, his slightly opened lips,
        the collar caught by his finger, and the fingertips that drew across his
        body…
      </p>

      <p>
        “I think it’s great,” Ding Zhuxin said. “Very seductive, but also very
        sensitive.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t say anything as he looked down at the camera in his hands
        for a long time, finally, he took a breath and slowly exhaled as if
        sighing.
      </p>

      <p>“I’m gonna…” Gu Fei put down the camera, “To the bathroom.”</p>

      <p>
        After he sat on the lid of the toilet, Gu Fei lit a cigarette hanging in
        his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>And watched as the smoke drifted toward the window.</p>

      <p>Life… had always been full of all sorts of unpredictable things.</p>

      <p>
        For example, Gu Miao had been unpredictably found by Jiang Cheng, who
        had unpredictably kissed Mother Earth in front of his shop, and then
        unpredictably became his deskmate…
      </p>

      <p>The aforementioned were not too unpredictable.</p>

      <p>
        What surprised Gu Fei was that he, who had always known himself to have
        a fairly good grasp of all things, had actually reacted when taking
        those pictures.
      </p>

      <p>This kind of thing was truly unpredictable.</p>

      <p><em>Truly </em>unpredictable.</p>

      <p>
        Even a person like him who had always been indifferent had to hide in
        the toilet to calm down.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he thought about this point, he couldn’t help but think that if
        Jiang Cheng was him…… he would probably off himself in the toilet.<a
          href="#_ftn9"
          >[9]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei came out of the toilet with a cigarette hanging in his
        mouth, Jiang Cheng was standing in front of the clothing racks, fighting
        to the death with another piece of garment.
      </p>

      <p>
        The unflagging battlefield had reached a stalemate; he tore apart at the
        garment, but the garment had locked fiercely around his throat.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he heard the door behind him sounded, he lifted his arm and peeked
        through the gap in the garment. Seeing that it was Gu Fei, he didn’t
        even care to be embarrassed and kept his voice down. “Fuck, come and
        help me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… what’s going on here?” Gu Fei quickly stubbed the smoke and walked
        over. He reached out his hands several times but didn’t know where to
        pull to release him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah, huh.” Jiang Cheng still had his arm held up, showing half a face
        full of anger and frustration from between his arm and collar. “This is
        not fucking meant for humans to wear! This neckline, only infants can
        get into this!”
      </p>

      <p>“Wait.” Gu Fei circled around him, “Let me see.”</p>

      <p>
        “If you had come out any later, I would’ve torn this outfit apart. I’ll
        admit it even if I have to pay for the damages,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I think…” Gu Fei lifted the left side of the garment for a look, “Did
        you go in through the sleeves?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… when you put it like that.” Jiang Cheng was stiff in place, “I
        suddenly feel like that does make a lot of sense.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t say anything and neither did he.</p>

      <p>
        After two seconds, he knew that his and Gu Fei’s cycle of foolish
        laughter was about to break loose again.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time Ding Zhuxin came out, the two were already engaged in a
        perfervid laugh. Gu Fei attempted to help him out of the garment several
        times, but the laughter had weakened his hands which made his efforts
        unsuccessful.
      </p>

      <p>
        And Jiang Cheng, himself, laughed so hard that he felt that even if the
        cuff of the sleeve strangled him, he wouldn’t be able to stop.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m sorry.” Ding Zhuxin took out her cellphone and snapped a picture of
        the two. “I need to post this on my Moment.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What?” Gu Fei asked as he leaned against the rack and continued to
        laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        “My part-time photographer and my part-time model,” Ding Zhuxin said.
        “Have gone crazy.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Almost done. He went in through the sleeves.” Gu Fei finally calmed
        down and lightly pulled and tugged at the garment while Jiang Cheng
        moved back, trying to make his arms and head become one – at long last,
        the garment came off.
      </p>

      <p>“<em>Ai</em>!” He crouched on the floor, “I’m freaking beat.”</p>

      <p>
        “Hurry up, <em>Jie</em> will treat you both to take-outs for dinner.”
        Ding Zhuxin turned around and went back in.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the start, Jiang Cheng didn’t think 30 sets of clothes were much,
        after all, he would sometimes put together and try out two or three
        outfits just before heading out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, he finally knew how annoying it was to get dressed and undressed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Constantly dressing, constantly undressing, and then having to stand in
        front of the lights to search for all sorts of feelings while the
        soreness in his legs from the ballgame had yet to completely wane, he
        wanted to rip off the clothes every time he changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        The crucial point was that Ding Zhuxin’s clothes were all complete sets,
        not 30 separate pieces of clothing whereas just changing the trousers
        alone two or three times was enough – for each change, he had to strip
        from head to toe.
      </p>

      <p>
        When darkness reigned, Ding Zhuxin had said for them to eat first, but
        Jiang Cheng refused. He felt that if he stopped to rest and finished a
        meal, he wouldn’t want to continue anymore even if he was beaten to
        death; even additional money wouldn’t increase his enthusiasm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence, neither of them ate and pressed on until past nine o’clock before
        finally completing today’s tiring mission.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hungry?” Ding Zhuxin asked as she transferred the day’s pay to Jiang
        Cheng. “Go downstairs and eat something. What do you want?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I… don’t want to eat.” Jiang Cheng felt a lot more comfortable after he
        changed into his own clothes. His whole body became relaxed and then
        exhaustion struck him. “I’m going back to sleep, I’m dead tired.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re not hungry?” Ding Zhuxin said, “Just have a bite or two. What
        happens if you get hungry later in the night?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Thank you, Xin-<em>jie</em>.” Jiang Cheng yawned, “Honestly, I’m so
        sleepy that I don’t even feel hungry anymore. I reckon that even if I’m
        hungry later, I won’t even know it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Ding Zhuxin laughed, “Alright then. Will you still have the energy to
        come over tomorrow?”
      </p>

      <p>“It’ll be fine after I sleep,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “Then, you should take a taxi back,” Ding Zhuxin said. “I’ll reimburse
        you for the travel expenses.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No worries,” Jiang Cheng quickly said. “It’s really not necessary, I’ll
        take care of it myself.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Ding Zhuxin still had something to say but Gu Fei cut in. “Give me the
        money. I’m taking the taxi back with him.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re not eating either?” Ding Zhuxin looked at him, a bit surprised.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei took out a stick of cigarette and lit it. “My mom made food
        today and left some for me. I have to eat it all when I get back,
        otherwise, she will cry again.”
      </p>

      <p>“Alright then.” Ding Zhuxin nodded.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng went to flag down a taxi by the roadside while Gu Fei and
        Ding Zhuxin stood there in silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei,” Ding Zhuxin opened her mouth when she saw a taxi approaching.
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        “This is my first time seeing you laugh so heartily like that,” Ding
        Zhuxin stated as she looked at Jiang Cheng’s back. “I watched you grow
        up and today was the first time I’ve seen it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What do you mean, watched me grow up?” Gu Fei laughed, avoiding Ding
        Zhuxin’s words. “You’re only a few years older than me, and you sound
        like my mom. I also watched you grow up.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Get in the car,” Ding Zhuxin said. “I have some things to take care of
        tomorrow, so I won’t be here. I will have the outfits that need to be
        photographed prepared by then. My assistant will come over to do the
        makeup, and you can help me with the rest.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay.” Gu Fei threw away the cigarette butt and got in the taxi.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng fell asleep as soon as his body touched the seat; he could
        even sense himself sleeping like a pig. Gu Fei pushed him several times
        before he finally realized that it was not the shaking of the taxi and
        opened his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We’re here?” Jiang Cheng rubbed his face and opened the door, preparing
        to get out. “I had almost started to dream.”
      </p>

      <p>“Uh…” Gu Fei pulled at his arm.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was about to ask him what happened when he heard the
        commotion from up ahead. There was the sound of a man shouting, a woman
        screaming, and another woman wailing.
      </p>

      <p>
        And as his eyes followed the source of the sound, his whole body sank
        into an endless state of anxiety – in that instant, an afternoon and
        half a night of exhaustion were literally going to blow the lid off his
        head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo, Li Hui, and Li Qian – his own father, brother, and sister –
        he recognized at a glance. There was also a woman with a limp who he had
        never seen before nor did he know who she was.
      </p>

      <p>
        This woman was dragging her limping leg and scuffling with Li Baoguo,
        crying and cursing, though she appeared to be speaking in dialect with a
        heavy accent that he could not make out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo was completely unlike his cowardly self from the other day
        when he lay on the ground and held his head as those people kicked and
        beat him. Now he was very aggressively fighting with this woman, but no
        matter how hard Li Hui and Li Qian pulled at him, they could not hold
        him back.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Believe it or not, I’ll beat you to death!” Li Baoguo’s words were
        clear and full of vigor: “You must have not been fixed<a href="#_ftn10"
          >[10]</a
        >
        enough by <em>laozi </em>yet! Just see if I’ll let you come out of this
        alive today!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng suddenly felt out of breath. He threw himself back into the
        taxi, which pushed Gu Fei —who was about to get off with him— back in
        and closed the door.
      </p>

      <p>“What’s wrong? You’re not getting off?” the driver asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Let’s take you back first,” Jiang Cheng softly said to Gu Fei – his
        throat feeling a bit tight.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright.” Gu Fei didn’t ask further. “Shifu<a href="#_ftn11">[11]</a>,
        please turn to Beixiao street.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay.” The driver turned around the car and drove over to the next
        street.
      </p>

      <p>
        After passing Gu Fei’s shop, the taxi moved ahead for a while longer.
        Once they reached the front of several residential buildings, Gu Fei
        told the driver to stop.
      </p>

      <p>“Are you going anywhere else?” the driver asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Just here.” Gu Fei handed the driver the money and then pushed Jiang
        Cheng. “Get out.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng did as he was told and got out of the taxi, his whole head
        feeling a bit numb as he looked at the building before him. “Your
        place?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei said and walked toward the entrance. “Come watch me work on
        the photos.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What photos?” Jiang Cheng hesitated for a moment but still followed
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your photos ah, don’t you want to see them? So <em>hawt,</em>”<a

          >[12]</a

        Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>“Okay,” Jiang Cheng smiled.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        The building Gu Fei lived at was newer than Li Baoguo’s. Although it had
        also been built by the street with no fencing or property management and
        was probably also public housing, it seemed much more pleasing on the
        eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was not imbued with the strong stench of the city center, and even
        the corridor walls were still white without any sign of cobwebs.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was similar in that it was also a low-rise building without
        elevators, and once you entered, climbing the stairs all the way up was
        the only option – unfortunately. When they got to the fifth floor, Jiang
        Cheng honestly couldn’t help but ask, “What floor do you live on?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The seventh which is the top floor.” Gu Fei turned to give him a quick
        glance, holding a subtle smile at the corner of his mouth. “What, can’t
        go on anymore? Do you want me to carry you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Whatever, it’s not like you’re much better. Taking a whole three
        minutes just to pee before coming out,” Jiang Cheng said. “Your kidneys
        must be deficient.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at him for a few moments without speaking, then turned
        back around and continued up the stairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were four households units on the seventh floor, and Gu Fei’s
        place was the furthest in. When the door was opened, Jiang Cheng
        composed himself, still remembering the temper tantrum that Gu Fei’s mom
        threw in the shop the other day.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment he passed through the door, he saw Gu Fei’s mom standing in
        the living room talking on her phone with a cigarette in hand. Seeing
        the two of them come in, her somewhat startled eyes flew over Gu Fei’s
        shoulders and fell right on Jiang Cheng’s face.
      </p>

      <p>“Hello, Auntie,” Jiang Cheng quickly said.</p>

      <p>“Put it out,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Why are you so late?” Gu Fei’s mom put out the cigarette, hung up on
        the call, and looked them up and down. After a while, she went back to
        staring at Jiang Cheng’s face once more. “You must be the one at the
        shop last time?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yes.” Jiang Cheng nodded, wondering if he had to change his shoes. “I’m
        Jiang Cheng.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took out a pair of slippers from the cabinet and tossed it toward
        Jiang Cheng’s feet, then turned to look at her. “Is there still food?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah, I put aside quite a lot, enough for the two of you,” Gu Fei’s mom
        replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sit for a bit,” Gu Fei said. Then he walked to a door beside the living
        room, carefully pushed open just the slightest crack, and peered inside.
      </p>

      <p>
        “He’s checking on Er Miao,” Gu Fei’s mom explained to Jiang Cheng. “Our
        Er-Miao… as an older brother, he worries more than a father.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng smiled and didn’t speak.</p>

      <p>
        “Not asleep yet?” Gu Fei leaned against the door frame and said into the
        crack. “Cheng-ge is here, do you want to get up and say hello to him?”
      </p>

      <p>
        A few seconds later, the sound of slippers shuffling against the floor
        faintly came from the other room, followed by the sight of a Gu Miao in
        a long-style pajama dashing out the door.
      </p>

      <p>“Good evening,” Jiang Cheng said smiling.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao’s face was blank, but she seemed quite anxious as she ran toward
        him and sat down on the sofa next to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s almost 10 PM and you’re not asleep yet?” Jiang Cheng looked at her
        and fixed the disheveled hair on her head. “You’re going to get dark
        circles around your eyes tomorrow.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao rubbed her eyes and smiled.</p>

      <p>
        The little girl’s hair was much longer now, and although it still stuck
        out disorderly as if without a set rule, compared to the shaven head,
        boyish look from before, this was much prettier.
      </p>

      <p>
        The brother and sister took after their mother, especially Gu Miao – in
        a few more years, and with a bit of style, she would definitely be the
        standard of beauty.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Eating now?” Gu Fei and his mom walked to the kitchen together. “I’ll
        heat it up for you guys.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei responded. “Is there rice?”</p>

      <p>
        “Yeah.” Gu Fei’s mom said as she turned to glance at Jiang Cheng. “Is
        this kid Li Yan’s boyfriend?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Even though those words were not at all that particularly loud, Jiang
        Cheng could still hear them and then suddenly lifted his head in shock.
        <em
          >Niania<a href="#_ftn1"><strong>[1]</strong></a
          ><sup>1</sup> The wind’s too strong that I couldn’t hear clearly, say
          that again?!</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>“… no,” Gu Fei said. “What are you even thinking huh?”</p>

      <p>“Then why does he have on makeup?” Gu Fei’s mom asked.</p>

      <p>
        “What does makeup have to do with Li Yan? Li Yan doesn’t put on makeup…
        Ding Zhuxin asked him to take some photos for her today, and he didn’t
        get to remove the makeup yet… oh, that’s right.” Gu Fei popped his head
        out from the kitchen. “Jiang Cheng, you can just use my mom’s makeup
        remover and wash your face.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng stood up.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s mom took him to the bathroom and handed him the makeup remover
        oil. “Use this. It’ll remove it all pretty well. You can use the face
        cleanser at the top over there, it’s Gu Fei’s.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh, thanks, Auntie.” Jiang Cheng looked at the makeup remover oil.</p>

      <p>
        “The cotton pads are in that pink box…” Gu Fei’s mom looked at him, “Do
        you know how to use it?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng really wanted to say that he did, that way she could quickly
        leave and stop staring at him. But if he answered, “I do”, then he might
        become “Li Yan’s boyfriend” even though he didn’t know what makeup had
        to do with Li Yan… eventually, he could only answer with honesty: “I
        don’t.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Er Miao,” Gu Fei shouted from the kitchen, “Go help your Cheng-ge
        remove his makeup.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao quickly charged in. After Gu Fei’s mom walked out, she stood on
        her tiptoe and grabbed the pink box of cotton pads and took out two
        pads. She poured some of the makeup remover oil on the pad and waved her
        hand, gesturing for Jiang Cheng to squat down.
      </p>

      <p>“Now what?” Jiang Cheng squatted.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao looked at him and closed her eyes tightly before she opened them
        once more to stare at him.
      </p>

      <p>“Close my eyes, right? Alright.” Jiang Cheng closed his eyes.</p>

      <p>Gu Miao started to wipe his face with the cotton pad.</p>

      <p>
        Outside in the kitchen, Gu Fei and his mom didn’t say anything else.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the phrase “Li Yan’s boyfriend” was still echoing in Jiang Cheng’s
        ears. Gu Fei’s mom said those words so casually that it sounded as if
        she was talking about Li Yan’s girlfriend.
      </p>

      <p><em>Li Yan… is?</em> And it seemed quite well-known.</p>

      <p>
        If that was the case, then Gu Fei who hung out together with Li Yan
        every day, should be very understanding of this.
        <em>Then! Fuck! </em>Jiang Cheng suddenly opened his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao frowned and shook her head with the cotton pad still in her
        hand.
      </p>

      <p>He immediately closed his eyes again.</p>

      <p>
        If Gu Fei had people like that around him and had been in touch with
        such things… then when he kissed him that day, there was now another
        explanation!
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps he wouldn’t simply interpret it as extreme inebriation like the
        average person would.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck!</em></p>

      <p>If so, then matters had just gotten more awkward!</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao left after she finished helping him remove the makeup. He picked
        up Gu Fei’s face cleanser and looked at it, ‘leaves skin feeling fresh,
        comfortable, never tight or dry’… utter bullshit.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had used this before, it still left his skin tight – for it to be
        refreshing, it would also leave the skin tight.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he came out of the bathroom, his face was already uncomfortably dry
        and tight; the second he saw Gu Fei, it was so tight, he could barely
        open his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you have some sort of toner or cream?” Jiang Cheng asked, “My face
        is about to crack.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Without waiting for Gu Fei to speak, Gu Miao quickly sped to her room,
        and returned to give him a container of cream that was for kids.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng took it, “You’re quite shameless in showing off your
        good looks. How come you have this huh?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Li Yan bought it for her. She urges everyone else to use it all the
        time yet never uses it on herself, saying it’s annoying,” Gu Fei
        commented.
      </p>

      <p>“You know Li Yan?” Gu Fei’s mom looked at Jiang Cheng and asked.</p>

      <p>
        “… not well.” Jiang Cheng answered while applying the cream, feeling a
        bit helpless.
      </p>

      <p>
        “They’ve only met two maybe three times, and Li Yan doesn’t have a
        boyfriend.” Gu Fei was probably also dumbfounded. “You should go to
        sleep… Er Miao, you go to sleep as well.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao was very obedient and returned to her room to sleep. Gu Fei’s
        mom grabbed her phone and dialed a number, glancing at Jiang Cheng
        several more times before she finally went to her room and shut the
        door.
      </p>

      <p>
        The food that Gu Fei’s mom prepared was unexpectedly delicious. Although
        it went cold and had to be heated again, it was still very appetizing,
        especially the spareribs. Jiang Cheng ate four or five pieces in a row,
        and only stopped because of embarrassment.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can eat it all,” Gu Fei said. “I was so hungry that I don’t feel
        like eating anymore.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m also…” Jiang Cheng hesitated but ended up putting another piece in
        his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>“My mom’s food is pretty good huh,” Gu Fei laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng nodded then thought about it and sighed. He looked at
        the bowl of food before him. “It’s been quite a long time since… since I
        ate a home-cooked meal.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t say anything.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything else either as he continued to bury his
        head in eating.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ever since he arrived here, he had been practically consuming take-outs
        every day, otherwise, he went out for something casual. But since he was
        currently cooking for himself in order to save some money, it was
        normally just noodles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that he had unpredictably eaten such a delicious “home-cooked meal”,
        he suddenly felt a twinge of pain in his heart – although he tried hard
        to not let himself be affected, he still couldn’t control it and even
        his nose became stuffy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Luckily, Gu Fei had chosen that moment to get up to take his own dishes
        to the kitchen, so he quickly wiped away the tears from his eyes and
        took several deep breaths to calm down his emotions.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he finished, he didn’t even bother to fight with Gu Fei to wash
        the dishes – he just didn’t want to move.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can sleep on my bed if you’re tired,” Gu Fei said and opened the
        door to another room. “I’ll sleep on the sofa.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s no need.” Jiang Cheng stood up and followed him into the room.
        “I can sleep on the sofa since I can fall asleep anywhere anyways… this
        room of yours… isn’t bad.”
      </p>

      <p>
        At first glance, the decoration of Gu Fei’s living room was a style that
        appeared to be from about ten to twenty years ago and hadn’t been
        refurbished or updated since. Although it was much better than Li
        Baoguo’s place that would have still been snubbed by others even fifty
        years ago, it was extremely ordinary and not considered a wealthy style.
      </p>

      <p>But Gu Fei’s bedroom surprised him.</p>

      <p>
        The room wasn’t big and didn’t have any decoration aside from the slap
        of white walls, but he could see that each piece of furniture had been
        meticulously chosen and matched.
      </p>

      <p>
        The bed, bookcase, desk, chair, lazy sofa, small rug, and the hammock in
        front of the window – there were many things, but it did not feel
        chaotic, instead, a great sense of warmth and coziness permeated.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Tea?” Gu Fei picked up a small electric kettle on the desk and put some
        tea leaves inside. “Or plain boiled water?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Water.” Jiang Cheng sat down on the small sofa, “I won’t be able to
        sleep if I drink tea.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took a wedge of lemon, put it in a cup, and poured some water for
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The nice and hot lemon water, the soft sofa, along with the warm and
        cozy room that he had not felt in the longest time. Jiang Cheng leaned
        back with the cup of water in his hand and didn’t even want to utter a
        word.
      </p>

      <p>
        “My mom has a low EQ like that and tends to not think before she
        speaks.” Gu Fei sat down in front of the computer and connected the
        memory card from the camera. “You can listen to the words she says, but
        don’t take it to heart.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng sounded in response. He paused for a moment but
        couldn’t help it and asked, “Li Yan…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Li Yan really doesn’t have a boyfriend,” Gu Fei said then glanced at
        him and smiled. “But Li Yan really does… like men.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng clasped the cup in both his hands and used the rising
        steam to conceal his face, “Does everyone know… that he’s?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Our friends know. I don’t know where my mom learned it from, but she
        won’t go around telling others,” Gu Fei said while transferring the
        photos, “This kind of matter, it’s not something anyone would willingly
        let others know, right?”
      </p>

      <p>“Yeah,” Jiang Cheng sighed.</p>

      <p>
        Just as that sigh came to an end, he suddenly returned to his senses and
        immediately cleared his throat in an attempt to mask that sigh.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei glanced at him but didn’t say anything.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was simply unable to control himself from overanalyzing that
        glance – the awkward tension that had not appeared between him and Gu
        Fei for the longest of time now encircled him once more.
      </p>

      <p>
        All he could do was stand up with the cup clasped in his hands and turn
        around the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        But since the room wasn’t that big, the place that he could walk to
        ended within only three steps. He felt as if he was just flopping
        around, and that was even more awkward than just sitting.
      </p>

      <p>Eventually, he stopped in front of the bookcase.</p>

      <p>“Can I look at the bookcase?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “… I don’t even know how to answer that.” Gu Fei turned to look at him,
        “What’s there on the bookcase that can’t be looked at that needs you to
        ask for permission?”
      </p>

      <p>“Ah,” Jiang Cheng laughed, “It’s a habit.”</p>

      <p>
        “Your previous… upbringing must have been a bit too strict,” Gu Fei
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Maybe, the whole family was very strict. Rules, courtesies, education.”
        Jiang Cheng looked at the books on the shelves, “I was slow. I should
        have known from the start that I wasn’t a part of their family. A family
        of five, and I was the least…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re pretty good,” Gu Fei looked at the progress bar of the photo
        transfer.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Here, I’m probably pretty good.” Jiang Cheng recalled Li Baoguo’s
        family and the woman with a limp that he had seen earlier. Yeah… only in
        an environment congested with that kind of life and that kind of
        lifestyle, could someone like himself be considered “good”.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Some things don’t need to be compared to be seen.” Gu Fei smiled,
        poured himself a cup of tea, and took a sip. “Whether or not a person is
        genuinely ‘good’, you only need to look at the person. There is no need
        to look at where he is or who’s around him.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… you,” Jiang Cheng looked at him in shock. “You suddenly don’t seem
        like the type of person to hand in a blank test paper.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Bullshit. When have I ever handed in blank test papers… I’ve always
        filled them all in beforehand,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>“Oooh,” Jiang Cheng couldn’t help laughing.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei picked up the camera and faced the lens toward him.</p>

      <p>
        “You’ve been shooting for the whole day, aren’t you fed up yet?” Jiang
        Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If it’s of you, then no,” Gu Fei said. “When you smile, you look very…
        good.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s smile froze on his face. Gu Fei held up the camera and
        cursed himself, <em>idiot. </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        When the first half of the sentence came out, he instantly felt that it
        wasn’t appropriate, especially just right after Li Yan’s sexual
        orientation was “exposed” – such words were bound to sound flirtatious.
      </p>

      <p>
        But against reason, he added another sentence in order to escape the
        trouble, though he immediately regretted it before he had even finished
        – words that were more inappropriate than the next, he insisted on
        finishing, otherwise, it would look even worse.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time he was completely finished, both he and Jiang Cheng were
        motionless.
      </p>

      <p>
        He held the camera to cover his face, not knowing what to say to ease
        the atmosphere.
      </p>

      <p>
        For someone who had never felt any sort of embarrassment, and seldom
        minded what other people thought, the dilemma before him now was in and
        of itself enough to make him speechless.
      </p>

      <p>
        “After this shoot is over, Ding Zhuxin will probably ask you to shoot
        some others.” Gu Fei was still holding the camera as he stared at Jiang
        Cheng’s face in the lens. “If you think that the price is suitable, you
        can work with her long-term. She’s always unsatisfied with her models
        but she was pretty happy with you today.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng looked to the left, then to the right and then back at
        the camera. “Then huh, I wanted to ask you ah, just that… that… uh,
        Xin-jie is your… that is, you and her… e… is she your…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Girlfriend?” Gu Fei interrupted him, “She’s not. I believe I’ve said it
        before. She and I are childhood friends. I call her big sister.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh!” Jiang Cheng responded loudly as if trying to escape the
        awkwardness.
      </p>

      <p>
        “All that effort.” Gu Fei couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief on
        his behalf, “I thought you were going to ask about Li Yan and I.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Huh?” Jiang Cheng froze and looked at him in utter shock, “You and Li
        Yan? Are….”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No!” Gu Fei put down the camera, “<em>Ai</em>, Li Yan and I are just
        friends. Does he and I look like a couple to you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know.” Jiang Cheng leaned against the bookcase, seemingly a bit
        unable to adjust to such a conversation, “Not really. He and Liu Fan
        look even more like it to me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei leaned on the chair and laughed for a while: “Liu Fan would be
        mad at you if he heard this.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… really.” Jiang Cheng glanced at him, smiled, and didn’t say anything
        else.
      </p>

      <p>
        Bu Shi Hao Niao along with Li Yan and Gu Fei, all appear to have a very
        good relationship, hung out together in their free time, and also had a
        common meeting point at the steel mill.
      </p>

      <p>
        But hearing the subtle meaning in Gu Fei’s words… even as close as they
        were, there was still someone who couldn’t just accept it.
      </p>

      <p>Yeah, what Pan Zhi said was correct.</p>

      <p>
        Leniency and tolerance only existed in two-dimensional worlds – reality
        was dreadfully ruthless.
      </p>

      <p><em>Then what about Gu Fei?</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng rested his head slightly back against the glass door of the
        bookcase and watched as Gu Fei leaned back and played with his camera.
      </p>

      <p>
        What kind of attitude he had could clearly be seen – he wasn’t disgusted
        and could accept it.
      </p>

      <p>But was there anything more?</p>

      <p>
        The kiss he had planted on Gu Fei’s face that day, Gu Fei didn’t even
        have any reaction to it. If it was Pan Zhi, he would at the very least
        be taken aback and then start to poke fun at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although Gu Fei was not someone who wore his heart on his sleeve, that
        kind of tranquil and unperturbed demeanor between two people who were
        not familiar enough with each other to get dead drunk was nonetheless a
        bit unusual.
      </p>

      <p>
        And now that he thought about it, his reaction the next day was also too
        natural.
      </p>

      <p><em>Too natural.</em></p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng took a sip of the lemon water.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei might be a xuezha, but he was a smart xuezha.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng suddenly felt a sense of weakness – that everything had
        already been seen through.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei probably knew everything, and the latest information made him
        unable to respond. So much so that he couldn’t even calmly continue on
        with their conversation.
      </p>

      <p>
        After all the photos were completely transferred, Gu Fei created a
        folder, marked the date, and then began to edit them.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cursor slowly swiped through the dense thumbnails of photos. He
        didn’t like to arrange the pictures in sequence and preferred to pick
        them out himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cursor finally clicked on the one with Jiang Cheng’s finger caught
        on the collar.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the photo was opened, he leaned back – compared to that split
        second at the set, this clear and sharp frozen moment that suddenly
        appeared before his eyes was even more stunning.
      </p>

      <p>
        He propped his arms on the armrests of his chairs, rested his fingers
        against his forehead, and whistled softly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “And what about you?” Jiang Cheng suddenly asked those words at this
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei thought that he would just say “shut up, you” as a conditioned
        reflex, but when he realized what Jiang Cheng said was not that, he
        didn’t even dare to turn his head to look at Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En?” He maximized the image to full screen and adjusted the color.
        “What… about me?”
      </p>

      <p>“Are you?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        To be honest, Gu Fei never thought that Jiang Cheng, who was easily
        prone to awkwardness at the drop of a hat, would suddenly be so
        straightforward – there wasn’t even a hint of concealment in his tone.
      </p>

      <p>“Are <em>you</em>?” Gu Fei turned around.</p>

      <p>
        “You know if I am or not.” Jiang Cheng looked straight at him, “Now, it
        is me asking you.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei did not want to answer this question.</p>

      <p>
        Whether or not Jiang Cheng was, he had never actually thought about it,
        much less in detail.
      </p>

      <p>And also whether he was or not didn’t have any effect on him.</p>

      <p>
        Even if he had some sort of ideas, he had always kept it to himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        What Jiang Cheng wanted to know, he was a bit afraid to answer –
        however.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was relatively easier to get along with each other if neither knew
        about the other, or at least feigned ignorance. But if it was suddenly
        out in the open, all the attraction and attention would have a defined
        purpose and that could expectedly create a panic-stricken feeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        At least he was like that. He had never thought of doing anything. But
        once things became transparent, his every word, every look, could all be
        construed to seem as though he expected something.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nevermind,” Jiang Cheng took the cup and sat back down on the sofa. He
        looked up and let out a long sigh of relief, “You don’t have to say
        anything, I know.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei.” Jiang Cheng tilted his head to the side to also look at him,
        “I honestly don’t mean anything else by it. I just want to tell you that
        if you know, keep it a secret for me, I don’t want… others to know.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei nodded, recalling that this was the first time that Jiang
        Cheng did not call him ‘Gu Fei’.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just like how you also don’t want others to know.” Jiang Cheng took
        another sip of water.
      </p>

      <p>“You, threatening me?” Gu Fei laughed.</p>

      <p>“Yeah.” Jiang Cheng also laughed and nodded his head.</p>

      <p>“I will keep it a secret,” Gu Fei said.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        After the non-verbal agreement ended, neither of the two spoke again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei did not acknowledge or denied Jiang Cheng’s question, and even
        after Jiang Cheng came to the “conclusion”, he still did not acknowledge
        or deny it.
      </p>

      <p>
        His attitude was a little vague, but Jiang Cheng felt that it was
        enough. His question was originally just a daring probe that simply
        appeared to be an attack to protect his own secret.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were so many people in this world who wanted to keep themselves
        hidden and so many things that they needed to keep hidden.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei opened the window just a crack, lit a cigarette, and prepared to
        continue with retouching the images.
      </p>

      <p>After two drags, Jiang Cheng reached out his hand: “Give me one.”</p>

      <p>
        “You usually smoke, don’t you?” Gu Fei placed the pack of cigarettes in
        his hands. “How come you’re always asking me for one? What happens when
        I’m not here?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I ran out,” Jiang Cheng said and lit one. “If you’re not here, I just
        won’t smoke.”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei cracked the window open just a bit more.</p>

      <p>“It’s cold.” Jiang Cheng withdrew back onto the sofa.</p>

      <p>
        “Then go smoke in the kitchen with the vent on.” Gu Fei clicked the
        mouse and enlarged Jiang Cheng’s face on the screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, for photos of clothes, he was generally disinclined to deal
        with the model’s face or only casually touched it up a bit at the very
        end – though, for most photos, he would directly crop out the face if he
        thought that it wasn’t shot nicely.
      </p>

      <p>
        This face of Jiang Cheng, however, was honestly very good – so good that
        he could set aside the details of the clothing and get to work on that
        face first.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the small lounging sofa near the desk, Jiang Cheng was basically
        face-to-face with him from where he was and couldn’t possibly see the
        screen, contrariwise, he needed not to fret over the embarrassment that
        would betide for if Jiang Cheng caught sight of him high-spiritedly
        touching up the model’s face first for photos he took of clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei.” Jiang Cheng reached over to lightly flick the ash into the
        ashtray on the desk.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei pushed the ashtray toward his hand. “Using my full name
        again?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You know, that was a plea earlier.<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> I had to try
        and pretend to be friendly with you.” Jiang Cheng held the cigarette in
        his mouth and smiled. “I have a question to ask you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ask away.” Gu Fei stared at the screen, and to be truthful, there
        wasn’t much that needed to be done to this face of Jiang Cheng’s –
        physiognomically beautiful with also remarkably good skin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced over at the bookcase, “The musical score that I saw
        last time, you wrote it right?”
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Gu Fei froze and then also looked over at the bookcase.</p>

      <p>
        “With such a large stack of books on music composition and all sorts of
        theories, if you still insist on saying that you didn’t write it,” Jiang
        Cheng said. “That’s just being too dishonest.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed and after a while leaned back into the chair, “Yeah, I
        wrote it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How unexpected.” Jiang Cheng spun the cup in his hand, “It sounded
        pretty good. An illiterate that can also write and compose music…”
      </p>

      <p>“I’m not illiterate,” Gu Fei corrected him.</p>

      <p>
        “A majorly unenthusiastic xuezha who can also write scores…” Jiang Cheng
        glanced at him. “You have any finished works?”
      </p>

      <p>“No,” Gu Fei answered him very bluntly.</p>

      <p>
        In reality, there were many finished works that were all saved in his
        computer even though he technically never listened to them, hence,
        saying that there were none wasn’t exactly wrong – the only one he
        occasionally listened to was the song sung by Ding Zhuxin.
      </p>

      <p>
        When it came to these things, it wouldn’t have mattered if it was some
        other person, they could have listened all they wanted. He wasn’t very
        willing to reveal them in the presence of Jiang Cheng, however.
      </p>

      <p>
        With Jiang Cheng being able to hum out the tune from just a quick glance
        of the score, he didn’t want to make a fool of himself due to any
        ignorant blunders.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Man up a bit.” Jiang Cheng was probably pretty bored as he said full of
        zest with the cigarette still in his mouth, “I will keep it a secret.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Keep a fucking secret,” Gu Fei laughed. He hesitated for a moment, then
        opened the music player, searched around, and clicked play on that song.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the guitar sounded, Jiang Cheng leaned back into the sofa. He
        didn’t know how to play the guitar but had always liked the sound of it.
        The thing was that everything he liked, whether it be the guitar, the
        tin whistle, or the recorder, his mother had always felt that they were
        not good enough to be presented.
      </p>

      <p>Then came the harmony of a piano.</p>

      <p>Devoid of feelings.</p>

      <p>
        Having heard it too much, and also playing it too much, he simply did
        not want to touch a piano for even a second after passing eighth grade
        junior high.
      </p>

      <p>
        His inept behaviour must have made his mother… made Shen Yiqing very
        much disappointed. After that, whenever relatives and friends came over
        and proposed to hear him play the piano, Shen Yiqing would always refuse
        with eyes full of disappointment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just be disappointed then, it wasn’t like he wanted to play anyways.
      </p>

      <p>
        The prelude was pretty good, and it was possible to clearly descry the
        conveyed emotion – complete obscurity.
      </p>

      <p>He couldn’t help but glance over at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        The perception that Gu Fei gave others was not of someone that had this
        sort of mentality.
      </p>

      <p>
        A low female vocal humming sounded, and Jiang Cheng recognized the voice
        immediately.
      </p>

      <p>“Ding Zhuxin?” He looked at Gu Fei, slightly taken aback.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei responded as he continued to edit the photo with his eyes
        still glued on the screen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stretched his head forward to take a peek – after holding
        back, that was – and saw a half of his own face and bare chest, along
        with a pulled open collar.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the fuck.” He quickly sat back down on the sofa… quite an oddity
        undoubtedly existed in seeing someone else editing photos of him.
        Naturally, he had been looking at himself in the mirror for more than a
        decade, however, this was downright awkward as heck as if he was peeping
        at a stranger.
      </p>

      <p>“This shot is especially good,” Gu Fei said, looking at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng nodded, then amidst Ding Zhuxin’s husky and indolent
        voice, he lowered his head to sip the lemon water.
      </p>

      <p><em>“I step into a void, as if I’m about to fly…</em></p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Above me is confusion, and below me, I hear you say ‘this world is
          empty’…</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>You say one, two, three, shatter the past, let it wither away…</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >The wind blows, destroying the path back, do you see me singing…</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >You say, one, two, three, turn around, listen to the panic being
          wiped out…”</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        The melody was quite obscure, and so were the lyrics. But when Jiang
        Cheng heard, “<em>do you see me singing</em>”, he looked up and swept a
        glance toward Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        The word “see” suddenly made him comprehend the concept of “soundless”
        that Ding Zhuxin had sought after earlier.
      </p>

      <p>A silent kind of repression.</p>

      <p>“Who wrote the lyrics?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Guess.” Gu Fei folded one leg on the chair and rested his chin on the
        knee while the mouse being clicked sounded.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It must be you,” Jiang Cheng said. “The lyrics and tune are all you,
        right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei grabbed the coat that had been thrown to the side, took out a
        handful of candies from the pocket, and placed them on the desk in front
        of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You play in a band with Ding Zhuxin, don’t you?” Jiang Cheng put a
        piece of milk candy in his mouth, feeling somewhat startled.
      </p>

      <p>
        He hadn’t completely grasped the lyrics, but he could still recognize
        the delicacy and sensitivity within… the tenor was such that it was
        difficult to connect it with Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked fixedly at Gu Fei, beneath the equanimous exterior of this
        person, what exactly was it like in his heart of hearts?
      </p>

      <p>“No. She used to bring me along, that’s all,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “That’s interesting,” Jiang Cheng said. “But you don’t seem the type to
        play around with these things. I wouldn’t be surprised if you played the
        guitar. Generally speaking, most bad boys tend to put in a bit of effort
        in knowing how to pull a few chords for the sake of showing off…”
      </p>

      <p>“I don’t know how to play the guitar,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Ohhh~ a bad boy that doesn’t know how to play the guitar,” Jiang Cheng
        said. “That’s considered a handicap on the road to picking up girls
        then.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei looked at him but didn’t say anything.</p>

      <p>“… oh.” Jiang Cheng raised the cup toward him.</p>

      <p>“Are you in a bad mood or something?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“En?” Jiang Cheng took a sip of the lemon water.</p>

      <p>“You got a lot to say,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng went silent for a moment then placed the cup on the desk,
        “Do you recognize the woman that was fighting with Li Baoguo earlier?”
      </p>

      <p>“I do,” Gu Fei answered plainly.</p>

      <p>
        “Is she Li Baoguo’s ex-wife?” Jiang Cheng asked. “The one that he beat
        off.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah, she did run off after he beat her, she’s not his ex-wife though.”
        Gu Fei lit another cigarette. “She’s his current wife. They’re not
        divorced.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… ah,” Jiang Cheng was startled but only for a second before he leaned
        back on the sofa and closed his eyes. “Fuck. What the fucking hell is
        all this shit, a bunch of crap.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “She hasn’t been back in quite a long time. We normally don’t even see
        her more than once every few years or so,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was probably Gu Fei’s way of consoling him: this woman didn’t
        normally show up, not even once every few years.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Jiang Cheng felt that no statement could spare his feelings because
        regardless of whether she only appeared once in a few years, or even if
        she did not reappear at all for a lifetime, she was still his biological
        mother.
      </p>

      <p>As inconceivable as Li Baoguo, yet so real – nonetheless.</p>

      <p>
        He especially wanted to call Shen Yiqing and ask her how desperate was
        she to actually adopt a child from such a family back then.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>,” Gu Fei called out to him. “Come here, I have
        something to say.”
      </p>

      <p>“What is it?” Jiang Cheng got up and walked over to his side.</p>

      <p>
        “If you’re able to go in for the shoot tomorrow,” Gu Fei pointed at the
        screen, “Pay attention to your arm, and bring it in a little…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck.” Jiang Cheng now saw clearly what he looked like in that
        outfit that allowed the wind through from all directions. He honestly
        couldn’t stand it and pointed at the photo, “You dare to edit photos for
        a living at this speed?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed, “No. I edit pretty quickly. It’s a progressive process…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “This is progressive? You’ve been on this exact photo for such a long
        time, where has the progress gone to anyways?” Jiang Cheng clearly could
        not understand this logic, “Is this photo a landslide-dammed lake?”<a
          href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        “I edited a bunch already. I’m just using this one to explain to you,”
        Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why do you have to use this one? Do I not have arms in the other
        photos?” Jiang Cheng sighed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed for a long while and then also sighed: “This one is
        exceptionally good. I reckon Ding-<em
          >laoban<a href="#_ftn4"><strong>[4]</strong></a> </em
        >will use it as the featured image, and she might even gift you the
        outfit.”
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck off,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>“Do you remember what I said just now?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I remember.” Jiang Cheng pulled up a chair behind him and sat down on
        it. “Bring my arms in a bit.”
      </p>

      <p>“Then I’ll continue,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng watched the cursor move back and forth as Gu Fei clicked on
        all sorts of editing options besides the photo, suddenly changing the
        image from light to dark and then maximizing to minimizing. After the
        change, he honestly couldn’t see any difference from the original if
        there was nothing to compare; he only knew that Gu Fei was certainly in
        the midst of this “progressive process.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As he watched the photos of his various poses and expressions being
        ‘tormented’ in Gu Fei’s very hands, he couldn’t exactly look directly at
        it, constantly worried whether such clearly captured photos would reveal
        his eye gunk, nose hairs, and so on…
      </p>

      <p>
        He stood up, returned to sit on the sofa and took out a notebook from
        his school bag.
      </p>

      <p>“Not watching anymore?” Gu Fei asked with his hand still moving.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t want to anymore,” Jiang Cheng said. “Is there another desk
        here?”
      </p>

      <p>“For doing homework?” Gu Fei turned around to look at him.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng nodded. “There’s an exam in a few days. I have to take
        a look at the notes.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was still looking at him, but his hand had now stopped moving
        altogether. He asked after a long while: “You <em>have</em> to study?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Bullshit.” Jiang Cheng stared at him in disbelief, “There’s an exam,
        why wouldn’t I study?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Gu Fei dropped the mouse and stood up. He moved the monitor and
        the keyboard to the side then unplugged the speakers and placed them on
        top of the computer tower which cleared half of the desk for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t you normally have a desk or something to do your homework on?”
        Jiang Cheng asked, putting his textbooks and notes on the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If I have time, I copy them at the shop. If not, I won’t write it,” Gu
        Fei answered matter-of-factly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh.” Jiang Cheng remembered that Gu Fei was after all a xuezha, zha,
        zha, zha.
      </p>

      <p>
        This thing called homework was for Jiang Cheng not a particularly
        annoying task since he could always write it out in any case. However,
        he was also always extremely serious every time.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he was in primary school, he didn’t like to do homework, but the
        discipline at home was very strict, and the consequences of not doing
        homework were dreadfully severe. He gradually developed the habit of
        writing quickly and conscientiously for the sake of playing hard after
        he finished.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the contrary, his younger brother had never allowed others to worry
        about things of these sorts.
      </p>

      <p>Naturally, hereditary was different – genetics was genetics.</p>

      <p>
        If he had never been adopted and had grown up next to Li Baoguo, then he
        would have been just as Li Baoguo and Li Hui were.
      </p>

      <p>
        He sighed lightly, collected his thoughts, and continued with his
        homework.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the gaps between his scribbles, he could see Gu Fei’s hand that was
        holding the mouse – it was truly, very good looking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t know how to play the guitar, but he should be able to play
        the piano, though at what level was unknown.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng liked to watch the way fingers leaped between the piano keys
        – this was also his only joy in practicing the piano before.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sole motivation to keep him playing a good tune was in the hope of
        seeing his fingers leap even more beautifully.
      </p>

      <p>
        When his homework was almost completed, he reckoned that the photos were
        done, seeing that Gu Fei’s hand had also left the mouse.
      </p>

      <p>“Done yet?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Just a bit more.” Jiang Cheng kept on writing while he asked, “Do you
        want to copy it?”
      </p>

      <p>“Are you going to help copy it for me?” Gu Fei asked again.</p>

      <p>
        “Can’t you have some face once in a while?” Jiang Cheng glanced at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I won’t copy it then.” Gu Fei stretched his body, “I’m sleepy. You can
        keep writing. I’m going to shower first.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng responded.</p>

      <p>
        Even though writing out his homework was a matter that highly dampened
        his spirit, he still had some rather shameless imaginations after Gu Fei
        walked out of the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        It wasn’t merely directed at Gu Fei, but rather at the phrase that Gu
        Fei had said, “take a shower”… after all, he was also a person who had
        seen many inappropriate ‘videos’, hence, in the atmosphere after
        exchanging secrets with Gu Fei, the lethality of those three words were
        still quite strong.
      </p>

      <p>
        And even more unbearable was that after he had managed to calm down
        himself – though with great difficulty – by focusing on his homework, Gu
        Fei had finished showering and walked back into the room with pajamas on
        – he was immediately hard once more.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fucking balls. </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you want to shower?” Gu Fei pulled open a drawer and took out a thin
        cardboard box. “I have an old pajama, and underwear that has never been
        worn before…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay.” Jiang Cheng quickly got up, snatched the box and turned to
        leave.
      </p>

      <p>“There are three pairs in there,” Gu Fei said from behind him.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng opened the box at the speed of light, took one out, and
        threw the box back at him before he walked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this wasn’t Gu Fei’s home, and his mom and little sister weren’t in
        their rooms, he would honestly have taken care of business in the
        bathroom. Ever since he got here, he had not done much of this activity
        especially with Li Baoguo who would always push open his door to come in
        at any moment, and the roaches and spiders that passed through the
        bathroom from time to time…
      </p>

      <p>
        Lost in his myriad of thoughts, he somehow finished showering only to
        then realize that Gu Fei didn’t give him a towel. After hesitating for a
        while, he picked up the clothes that were already wet from the shower
        water and carelessly wiped himself here and there.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sadly, right after he put on the underwear he then noticed once more
        that he had forgotten the pajamas in his haste.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck me.” He picked up the clothes that he had just changed out – which
        were originally wet – but after he used them to wipe himself, they were
        even more soaked.
      </p>

      <p>
        After going through a long mental battle, he finally came to a decision.
        He gritted his teeth and opened the bathroom door, wasn’t he just
        returning to the room in his only underwear after a shower? What was
        there to feel guilty about?
      </p>

      <p>
        Even if he was, and Gu Fei was also, so what? It wasn’t like they had to
        fool around just because they both were.
      </p>

      <p>
        But before he walked out with confidence, he saw a set of neatly folded
        pajamas on the chair at the bathroom door.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei, the kind of person that took care of others until it became a
        habit was sometimes, simply an angel… he grabbed the clothes, swiftly
        put them on, and immediately let out a sigh of relief.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he pushed open the door to Gu Fei’s room, the computer on the desk
        was already turned off, and Gu Fei himself was sitting cross-legged on
        the bed playing on his phone.
      </p>

      <p>“I…” Jiang Cheng walked somewhat awkwardly toward the sofa.</p>

      <p>
        “You can just sleep on the inside of the bed,” Gu Fei said without
        looking up. “Don’t sleep on the sofa.”
      </p>

      <p>“Why?” Jiang Cheng thought that was quite strange.</p>

      <p>
        “Gu Miao sleepwalks, she will sometimes come in to sleep on the sofa,”
        Gu Fei said. “She will get scared if you take her place.”
      </p>

      <p>“She even sleepwalks?” Jiang Cheng was taken aback.</p>

      <p>
        “Not often. But since you’re here today, she’s very excited so I’m a bit
        worried.” Gu Fei put down his phone and looked at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright.” Jiang Cheng wanted to say that he could sleep in the living
        room at first but then he thought that that was too deliberate thus he
        simply nodded his head instead. “You sleep on the inside.”
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Gu Fei didn’t comprehend that.</p>

      <p>
        “This bed of yours,” Jiang Cheng said, pointing at the bed. This bed in
        Gu Fei’s room was framed and completely enclosed from the head to the
        end like an old traditional Chinese bed, and even if the design was very
        modern and beautiful, it still had a very strong sense of privacy. “I’ll
        sleep on the outside.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay.” Gu Fei shifted to the inside and moved the pillow and comforter
        from the inside to the outside for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why on earth did you buy such a bed?” Jiang Cheng sat on the edge, “For
        a sense of security?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “To block Gu Miao.” Gu Fei pointed at the foot of the bed, “She
        sometimes comes in without knocking, and she can see the bed the moment
        she comes in. If I’m doing a bit of something on the bed, I won’t have
        enough time to tidy up. But if I lock the door, she’ll get mad when she
        can’t get in.”
      </p>

      <p>“… ah.” Jiang Cheng couldn’t help but glance back at him.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei returned his gaze with a serious expression.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Jiang Cheng laughed. Even though the topic had ahint of
        <em>that</em> nature, he still felt that it was indeed laughable.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s how tiring it is to have a little sister.” Gu Fei laughed along
        with him, “I must have done something that wronged her in my past life.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I doubt it.” Jiang Cheng leaned against the headboard and pulled the
        comforter over himself. “Honestly, it’s because you’re a good brother.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is that so.” Gu Fei lowered his head and continued to play on his
        phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, even though you’re always playing that retarded game…” Jiang Cheng
        glanced down at his phone screen only to see that he wasn’t actually
        playing that retarded Craz3 Match game, guessing he probably ran out of
        lives. “I used to have a brother.”
      </p>

      <p>“Younger brother?” Gu Fei turned his head, somewhat surprised.</p>

      <p>
        “En, their biological son, two years younger than me.” Jiang Cheng
        placed the pillow behind his back, “I get annoyed whenever I see him,
        and he’s also annoyed when he sees me. I haven’t spoken a word to him,
        long before I came here…”
      </p>

      <p>“Different personalities, I presume,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “En, the whole family has a different personality from me,” Jiang Cheng
        said.
      </p>

      <p>The two went quiet and neither no longer spoke.</p>

      <p>
        But the silence in the room this time around did not make Jiang Cheng
        feel awkward – however. He stared blankly into space for a moment then
        turned on his phone and started to chat with Pan Zhi.
      </p>

      <p>– Grandpa, do you still remember Huang Hui from Class 117?</p>

      <p>– You finally can’t hold it in anymore and want to take action?</p>

      <p>
        – Not at all. I wanted to say that she fucking got with that dogshit
        Liang Zhiyong | the nasty fucker. Right now, I want to cry but failed to
        shed a single tear.
      </p>

      <p>
        – They just started, right? You still have a chance, hurry up and step
        in between them.
      </p>

      <p>
        – That’s what I’m thinking also though I’m still considering which one
        of them can I succeed in seducing more easily.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng laughed at his phone for the longest time until Gu Fei
        turned to look at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “My buddy,” Jiang Cheng said while still laughing. “He lost a love
        prematurely.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The one who went with you to the gymnasium during winter break?” Gu Fei
        asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng nodded, thought about it some more, and then laughed
        again. “Exactly, the grandson.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Silence visited once more after that laughter; the two continued to play
        on their phones, and although Jiang Cheng felt at first that this
        posture of leaning on the headboard would make him extremely awkward and
        unable to move an inch, it was unexpectedly the most comfortable “before
        falling asleep” that he had experienced in a long time.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few moments of playing on his phone later, he heard soft laughter
        coming from Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng turned to look at him, and Gu Fei naturally passed his phone
        over to him. “Have you looked at our forum in the last two days?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Never thought about it.” Jiang Cheng took the phone, “Are they talking
        about the competition?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei laughed and nodded.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at the screen. Si Zhong’s forum was quite lively, and
        each post had a ton of views and replies. He glanced at the titles.
      </p>

        He laughed; reading the style of the title, he felt that the students at
        Si Zhong had become more adorable than usual. “Do you reply to the
        posts?”
      </p>

      <p>“Of course I do,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“What’s your ID?” Jiang Cheng asked as he scrolled down.</p>

      <p>
        “花式帅<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> ostentatiously_handsome,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng choked then tilted his head to the side to cough for a while
        before he turned his head back. “The fuck?”
      </p>

      <p>“Keep it a secret,” Gu Fei said. “No one knows that this is me.”</p>

      <p>
        “It must be kept a secret. You could even push the blame to Gu Miao for
        ‘Gentle Little Bunny’.” Jiang Cheng tsk-ed twice, “If this ID was
        discovered, your image as a cold and aloof person will collapse
        instantly.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei laughed and didn’t say anything.</p>

        Jiang Cheng’s finger twitched when he scrolled down to this title. There
        was a thumbnail uploaded below this post and with just one glance, he
        could tell that this was of him and Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>… this forum was just too scary.</p>

      <p><em>***</em></p>

      <p>The author has some words to say:</p>

      <p>
        Continuing tomorrow. Thank you classmate -symphenomnia- for suggesting
        all sorts of post titles in chapter 28, hahahahahaha it was quite
        appropriate to use, simply.
      </p>

      <p>
        You actually dared to help Da Fei write lyrics, you’ll be roasted for
        sure o(≧口≦)o！ *the black furry spirit shouted loudly*
      </p>

      <p>
        Starting today, shut up for three days. There have already been
        complaints reported about you overusing the hard drive! *The author who

        His previous school also had a forum, but it wasn’t frequent much; after
        all, it was a key high school where the teachers fell short of actually
        holding metal detectors to scan each individual student for mobile
        phones the second they entered through the gate every day. Consequently,
        phones were at constant risk of being confiscated, which was the direct
        effect of why no one generally toyed with these things, and at most,
        there were only small-scale gossip groups on WeChat.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Such a forum, meshed with all sorts of erratic discussions and
        spectacles was not something that Jiang Cheng had been exposed to in the
        past.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        In barely a day, the fujoshi thread that was posted on the day of their
        match had tons of likes and comments that were extremely astonishing.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng hesitated for a long while but didn’t click open the post
        for a look in the end.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Although this kind of groundless teasing was common amongst young girls,
        he wouldn’t have felt anything even if he and Wang Jiuri were matched,
        however, he felt uneasy upon seeing that it was he and Gu Fei that was
        put together.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        In the end, he clicked open the post that discussed ‘Da Fei, my idol’.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        There were many photos of Gu Fei during the game that were taken from
        various angles. The girl must have circled the court for however many
        times just to get some of these photos. There were even some of Gu Fei
        doing layups that were taken from below – who knew how she managed to
        get such a shot.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The first few comments were all photos and the original poster’s frantic
        ‘ah, ah, ahhhh’ with a long series of exclamation marks then below were
        some replies that echoed the aforementioned sound of wailing.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Once he reached the 30th comment, there was finally a voice of
        disagreement.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        – that’s it? You can find anyone like that on the street.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        That one comment, like a single tossed stone that created a thousand
        ripples, aroused many replies that lasted a good seven to eight pages
        long, all of which consisted of curses.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng glanced at the ID of the commenter only to no longer be able
        to hold it back, “What the… fuck!”
      </p>

      <p>ostentatiously_handsome<strong> </strong></p>

      <p>“You must really be bored,” he said and looked at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        “Unless they’re bored, who would get on…” Gu Fei took the phone back and
        giggled as he read it. “See, a xueba like you generally can’t be
        bothered to take a look.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ve… also looked,” Jiang Cheng said. “It’s just that the forum at my
        old high school was like a ghost town, no one looked at it.”
      </p>

      <p>“What’s your ID?” Gu Fei tilted his head.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng hesitated for a moment: “a_certain_cheng”</p>

      <p>“What?” Gu Fei couldn’t comprehend that.</p>

      <p>
        “My main account is ‘a_certain_cheng’ and the side account is
        ‘soandso_cheng’,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the hell kind of name is that? And you have the nerve to laugh at
        me,” Gu Fei said. “Since your WeChat was in English, I had to add a
        nickname. Why don’t you just combine your style and make them all
        something like ‘jiangxx”?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The thing is, I’m too lazy to think of a name,” Jiang Cheng said. “What
        nickname did you use for me?”
      </p>

      <p>“Cheng-<em>ge bei</em>.” Gu Fei glanced at him.</p>

      <p>
        “I think that Gentle Little Bunny should be the one who needs a
        nickname,” Jiang Cheng laughed.
      </p>

      <p>
        After that, the two of them no longer spoke. Jiang Cheng held his own
        phone and continued to blather with Pan Zhi; at first, he wanted to look
        at (High School No. Four) Sizhong’s forum again but with Gu Fei beside
        him, he decided against it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pan Zhi was quite envious that Sizhong’s forum was so lively and had
        even expressed that he wanted to join to pick up girls. Jiang Cheng
        laughed for a long while, looked at the time only to see that it was
        almost midnight, so he got ready to sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked over at Gu Fei and found that he had already fallen asleep
        somehow, lying with his face toward the wall and half his head buried
        beneath the comforter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at the headboard and noticed a power switch; he
        pressed it, eliminating the light and the room was overtaken by a sheet
        of darkness. A few seconds later, he saw a faint light leaking in from
        behind the window curtains.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he laid on the pillow, Jiang Cheng turned to the right. It had
        always been a habit of his to sleep on this side, however, the moment he
        turned, he saw Gu Fei lying there with his back toward him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hence, he had no choice but to turn his body to the left side and closed
        his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        He recalled a survey regarding sleeping positions between couples that
        consisted of side-by-side, face-to-face, and so on with the most popular
        being both individuals lying on the same side called “spooning”…
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck. </em>He suddenly thought of what that meant.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei slept quite silently with a very even breathing pattern that
        carried a hypnotic effect to it. Jiang Cheng followed along with his
        breathing and drifted to sleep not long after.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, who knew whether it was due to the change of bed or because
        someone was beside him, but he couldn’t fall into a deep sleep – since
        he was a child, he had never slept with another person on the same bed
        before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even when he was in a daze, dreaming and knowing full well that he was
        dreaming, he could still sense Gu Fei turning over beside him.
      </p>

      <p>Moreover, the dreams were incoherent and changed constantly.</p>

      <p>
        Finally, he dreamed that he and Gu Fei were standing in the middle of
        the basketball court, naked, and surrounded by a group of people with
        paper bags over their heads that were taking photographs of them while
        hurling all sorts of curses and making sharp jeering noises.
      </p>

      <p><em>This is a dream.</em></p>

      <p>
        And quite preposterous too – he wondered why he would have a dream with
        such details so suddenly.
      </p>

      <p><em>This isn’t real, </em>he reminded himself.</p>

      <p>
        But this dream was unlike the ones he previously had that could be sped
        up, rewound, or skipped at will – it simply kept to the conventional
        ways and moved ahead step by step.
      </p>

      <p>
        His perspective was sometimes of his own as he faced the surrounding
        onlookers and ridicules, and sometimes it became that of another
        outsider, rotating like a camera that circled the two people on the
        court at high speed.
      </p>

      <p>In a state of horror and panic, he turned to look at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was saying something to him without any expressions at all, but
        he couldn’t hear a single word.
      </p>

      <p><em>Do you see me singing…</em></p>

      <p><em>Listen, to the panic being wiped out.</em></p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei heard the sound of the door, opened his eyes, and found that the
        first appearance of light in the sky was approaching as a faint warm
        light bled in through the curtains. Gu Miao walked in barefooted with a
        fixed gaze and then sat down on the sofa before she adjusted the cushion
        and lay down.
      </p>

      <p>He sighed lightly and sat up quietly.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao used to sleep with him in this room. After primary school, Gu
        Fei let her sleep by herself, but Gu Miao would still come back every
        time she experienced an episode of sleepwalking, however, with Gu Fei’s
        firm education of, “brother is a boy, you can’t sleep on a bed with a
        boy so casually,” she would go straight to the sofa.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei glanced over at Jiang Cheng’s face. Jiang Cheng appeared to be
        sleeping soundly, but his breathing was a little unstable – he was
        probably dreaming.
      </p>

      <p>
        He propped his hand on the bed with one leg knelt at the side of Jiang
        Cheng and stretched the other leg over Jiang Cheng’s body. This person
        actually occupied quite a bit of space when he was sleeping, Gu Fei
        nearly pulled a hamstring to avoid stepping on him.
      </p>

      <p>Then he picked his body and prepared to cross over Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        But just as he was passing directly above Jiang Cheng, Jiang Cheng
        frowned abruptly and turned over – the two were suddenly face-to-face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei felt that Jiang Cheng wasn’t in a very deep sleep upon seeing his
        tightened brows and uneven breathing… he quickly propped himself up a
        bit more, intending to cross over immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he wanted to push off with the leg that was knelt on the inner
        side in order to directly jump off the bed, Jiang Cheng opened his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei wanted to say something but was afraid of waking up Gu Miao who
        had just laid down, and also because he was unsure of whether or not her
        state of sleepwalking had ended. Hence, all he could do was stare at
        Jiang Cheng and wait for him to be fully awake.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s opened eyes instantly stretched from a slit to a set of
        enlarged European-style eyes. And after staring at him for a few
        seconds, he said two words in a hoarse tone that was filled with
        confusion, shock, and horror: “The fuck…”
      </p>

      <p>
        With the sound not being low in any way, Gu Fei was startled and quickly
        used his hand to cover Jiang Cheng’s mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s eyes became rounder, and he immediately started to
        struggle as if he had been stabbed with a knife, flinging his arms and
        lifting his knees all over the place. Gu Fei didn’t dare to loosen the
        hand that was covering his mouth, but his current position also left him
        wide open and he was afraid that Jiang Cheng might knee him in the
        crotch…
      </p>

      <p>
        It took a long while for him to grab hold of one of Jiang Cheng’s arms
        before sitting his butt directly down on Jiang Cheng’s body. He kept his
        voice down and said: “Gu Miao!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng paused, stared at him for a bit, and then suddenly shifted
        his eyeballs toward the sofa.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei loosened his hand on his mouth: “She just came in. I’m not sure
        if she’s asleep again or not. I want to go check on her.”
      </p>

      <p>“… en,” Jiang Cheng responded and lied still.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei got off the bed and walked over to crouch in front of the sofa.
        He looked at her for a moment and then got a blanket from the closet and
        covered Gu Miao with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng also sat up and stared at Gu Fei without even a hint of
        sleepiness left and was as awake as if he had drunk two bottles of
        eucalyptus oil.
      </p>

      <p>
        Opening his eyes just to see Gu Fei hovering over his body was honestly
        a bit too exciting for someone who had always slept alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment, he couldn’t even tell if he was still dreaming or was
        already awake; he had only returned to his senses from the horrifying
        scene in his dream that had interlaced intricately with Gu Fei’s posture
        when he saw Gu Miao lying on the sofa.
      </p>

      <p>
        And also realized that at some point, he was already drenched in sweat.
      </p>

      <p>Cold sweat.</p>

      <p>
        The scene in the dream made him a bit unbearable already, but he
        suddenly thought that if Gu Miao had woken up and saw such a misleading
        position…
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng closed his eyes.</p>

      <p>
        He suddenly understood the reason why he didn’t click open that post.
      </p>

      <p>He was scared.</p>

      <p>
        This was the first time he had a profound understanding of his own fear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even a mere sleepwalking little girl lying on the sofa could merge with
        his dreamland so vividly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This is why I wanted you to sleep on the inside,” Gu Fei whispered
        after covering Gu Miao with a blanket. “If you sleep on the outside, I
        have to climb over you to get off the bed at night.”
      </p>

      <p>“What time is it?” Jiang Cheng also asked in a whisper.</p>

      <p>
        “Just past six o’clock.” Gu Fei looked at the little alarm clock on the
        bedside table.
      </p>

      <p>“Oh.” Jiang Cheng hugged the comforter and sat still.</p>

      <p>
        “What’s wrong?” Gu Fei got back on the bed from behind him, drilled
        underneath the comforter, and sat up. He then reached out to touch his
        pajamas, “You…”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng gave his arm a good slap.</p>

      <p>
        “… you have a fever?” Gu Fei pulled his hand back and completed the
        sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No.” Jiang Cheng was a bit embarrassed as he tugged at his clothes,
        “I’m just…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did I scare you just now?” Gu Fei lied down and sighed lightly. “In all
        my years, <em>you </em>are the most flustered that I have ever seen,
        <em>xueba</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck?” Jiang Cheng turned to look at him and reached out to gesture
        with his hand. “With the way you were just now, if I wasn’t already
        scared to death that must mean that I’m a xueba with an outstandingly
        amazing psychological quality, okay?”
      </p>

      <p>“Sorry about that,” Gu Fei smiled.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything and continued to sit but after a few
        minutes, he sneezed then helplessly lay down and covered himself with
        the comforter.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time, Jiang Cheng really couldn’t sleep, and his open eyes also
        didn’t know where to look either.
      </p>

      <p>
        He felt that his psychological endurance might not be very good and
        couldn’t help but to always cerebrate over any slight matter repeatedly
        and allow it to affect his mood – often putting substantial pressure on
        himself.
      </p>

      <p>… he understood the truth, albeit highly difficult to control.</p>

      <p>
        Every so often, he was quite envious of Pan Zhi. His heart was large
        enough to hold three and a half universes within it. Whether it was the
        repercussions of a failed exam or losing a love prematurely, with a
        night of good sleep, roars of motherfuckers, and some complaints, all
        things would pass.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for him… perhaps, having been influenced by the atmosphere from his
        previous family, whatever the case might be, it was impossible for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        There wasn’t much time left between six o’clock and the time to wake up.
        Jiang Cheng couldn’t fall back asleep but simply closed his eyes to
        recuperate while struggling strenuously between arbitrary and
        non-arbitrary thoughts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beside him, Gu Fei had fallen asleep the second he lay down, probably
        sleeping much more soundly after that interrupted sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        He consciously listened as Gu Fei’s breathing steadily evened out, then
        after an unknown amount of time, it slowly quickened, which was then
        followed by him turning over —probably waken now— before sensing Gu Fei
        reached beside the pillow for his phone to look at the time.
      </p>

      <p>
        The time meant for sleeping he didn’t, and now that he knew he had to
        get up Jiang Cheng suddenly was so tired that he didn’t want to open his
        eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei moved, and just when he was hesitating on whether to open his
        eyes now or wait for Gu Fei to cross over his body and then wake up, Gu
        Fei’s finger gently touched his forehead.
      </p>

      <p>
        He suppressed the urge to jump straight up and give him a good and hard
        square kick to the crotch<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>, but clenched his
        teeth and remained still instead.
      </p>

      <p>“No fever,” Gu Fei whispered and sat up.</p>

      <p><em>Fever?</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was dumbfounded then remembered that Gu Fei had asked
        earlier if he had a fever.
      </p>

      <p>
        He insisted on keeping his eyes closed, refusing to move but suddenly
        felt a slight ache inside his nose.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >This fucking nose can just be cut off, getting emotional so easily
          just like a girl<a href="#_ftn2"><strong>[2]</strong></a
          ><sup>2</sup></em
        ><sup></sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        He seldom received such meticulous care; even in his previous home when
        he was still their “own son”, he had to tell his parents if he felt
        unwell.
      </p>

      <p>
        Saying it would bring him very good care, but if not, as long as he
        didn’t faint on the spot, no one in the family would even notice that he
        was sick.
      </p>

      <p>
        And, it was even more preposterous after coming here. If at this moment
        he really had a fever, he didn’t even know who he could tell, Li Baoguo?
      </p>

      <p>Even if he did, what then?</p>

      <p>
        After contemplating about it, he would just call Lao Xu to request a
        leave of absence and then sleep for a half a day or so in that little
        room without any sense of belonging…
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>.” Gu Fei had stood up at some point and lightly
        kicked his leg, “Get up.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng answered and opened his eyes.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei had a coat over his pajamas and was preparing to get off from the
        foot of the bed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt that he was absolutely not doing it deliberately, but
        with just a glance, he could still see that a certain part of Gu Fei’s
        loose pajamas had bulged.
      </p>

      <p>
        He already couldn’t figure out how to react. He sighed and blurted out
        without thinking: “Don’t you have to wait every day for your little
        brother<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> to calm down first before getting up?”
      </p>

      <p>“… I have to urgently pee,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Not even afraid of your piss flying all over…” Jiang Cheng didn’t
        understand why, at this moment, he went along with such a topic as if he
        wasn’t completely awake when he obviously hadn’t slept.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Does your piss fly all over the place? I’ll teach you ah…” Gu Fei
        dragged his slippers and walked out, saying: “You have to stand a bit
        further away then keep peeing as you walk forward.”
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck you!” Jiang Cheng closed his mouth.</p>

      <p><em>Nutcase.</em></p>

      <p>
        After Gu Fei went out, he got up, and still sleeping on the sofa with
        her face against the backrest was Gu Miao, probably about to wake up as
        well. He got off bed and picked up the pants from the day before for a
        look, intending to change first before Gu Miao actually got up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unfortunately, he picked them up only to realize that because he was too
        anxious yesterday, the water was not shaken out of the now bundled
        together clothes; now all the fucking clothes were still wet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although they could still be worn and half an hour on his body would
        probably be sufficient for them to dry completely… it was quite
        disgusting, nonetheless.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he was worrying, Gu Fei walked into the room while brushing his
        teeth and handed him a new toothbrush. Jiang Cheng took the brush,
        “Thanks.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei continued to brush his teeth and pulled open the closet door,
        pointing at it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No.” Jiang Cheng only took a single glance at Gu Fei’s row of clothes
        and immediately shook his head, “No, I’m not wearing yours.”
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Gu Fei was a bit baffled as he looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “You’re ostentatiously_handsome. The whole school has their eyes on you.
        I highly doubt that none of them don’t know what your underwear looks
        like,” Jiang Cheng said. “The last time I wore your clothes, even Lao Xi
        could recognize it. I truly admire you from the bottom of my heart.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei laughed and happily walked out brushing his teeth.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng was resolved in wearing his own disgusting clothes.</p>

      <p>
        With Gu Fei occupying the bathroom, he could only change in the bedroom.
        He turned around to glance at Gu Miao,who didn’t show any sign of
        movements, swiftly took off his pajamas then grabbed his own jeans and
        pulled them up his legs.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was relatively shameless in showing off his good looks, so even the
        jeans he bought had to be slim-fitted. But since the legs of this thing
        were wet, it wasn’t easy to pull them up. Just as he got halfway there,
        Gu Miao rolled over and before he had a chance to react, she suddenly
        sat up.
      </p>

      <p><em>What the fuck!</em></p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao’s natural and clear-cut movement of getting up made him nearly
        fall over in shock as he rushed out —holding onto his pants before she
        could turn her head around.
      </p>

      <p>… and zipping them up while running into the bathroom.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was in the middle of washing his face when he turned to look at
        him: “Why the rush?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Rush my ass,” Jiang Cheng said as he finished buckling his belt. “I
        only pulled my pants halfway when Gu Miao suddenly woke up… doesn’t she
        have a grace period for when she wakes up?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It has always been like this.” Gu Fei smiled broadly, “She’ll space out
        for five minutes after she sits up before she actually wakes up.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng let out a sigh of relief.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei finished washing up, took Gu Miao back to her room, placed a set
        of clothes on her bed, closed the door and then returned to the living
        room.
      </p>

      <p>
        He usually didn’t get up so early. Gu Miao generally got up herself and
        went out to eat breakfast before he woke up. Even though Gu Miao had no
        school to go to now, they still had to strictly abide by that daily
        routine – that could not change.
      </p>

      <p>
        And with a xueba who was inherently never late at his house today, he<em>
          couldn’t just sleep</em
        >
        ‘til class started before waking up.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng finished washing up and came out, he asked: “What do
        you want for breakfast? I’ll have Gu Miao buy some in a bit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s no need,” Jiang Cheng said. “I… I don’t want to eat anything.
        I’ll head to school first.”
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Gu Fei froze but then nodded his head, “Oh, okay.”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng quickly packed up his things, said a few words to Gu Miao
        who had come out of her room rubbing her eyes and then carried his
        school bag out of Gu Fei’s home.
      </p>

      <p>
        He ran down the seventh floor, and after the wind blew through his not
        quite dry clothes, he suddenly came to his senses, feeling that since he
        was so easily emotional and flustered in the morning and then left in
        such a hurry just now, it just seemed a bit… bad.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei heard that he wasn’t having breakfast and wanted to head out
        first, the expression on his face was clearly of shock.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not to mention that Gu Fei had taken him in last night, let him eat a
        delicious meal and was even concerned about whether or not he had a
        fever, plus Gu Miao’s face full of expectations… only for him to then
        say those words and run out just like that – even the most basic of
        courtesy was missing.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took out his cellphone, leaned against a wall on the road that
        guarded him against the wind, and dialled Gu Fei’s number.
      </p>

      <p>“Forgot something?” Gu Fei answered the phone.</p>

      <p>
        “Bring Gu Miao down, there’s still time.” Jiang Cheng looked at the time
        on his phone, “Why don’t we go eat stuffed flatbread at Wang Jiuri’s?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright.” Gu Fei didn’t ask why he had a change of heart all of a
        sudden and agreed immediately.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he saw Gu Fei come out of the corridor with Gu Miao, Jiang Cheng
        suddenly felt a bit of regret – he shouldn’t have told Gu Fei about
        himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know when he could become as calm as Gu Fei, without
        deliberately approaching or keeping a distance, without having thorns
        fly out at any moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We’re heading over now, should be there in a bit.” Gu Fei had given
        Wang Xu a call, “You don’t have to prepare anything special. Just a
        simple breakfast, that’s all.”
      </p>

      <p>“Is there a bus that passes by there?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        Walking from where they were to school was doable, but if it was to go
        to Wang Xu’s place, walking was a bit far.
      </p>

      <p>“Let’s take the car,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “What car?” Jiang Cheng was startled, “The little cornmeal-coloured
        bun?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei nodded. “What, are you looking down on the little bun?”
      </p>

      <p>“I’m not,” Jiang Cheng sighed. “Alright, the little bun it is.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao must really like the little bun; as soon as Gu Fei drove the car
        out, she ran over hugging her skateboard and agilely climbed into the
        back seat.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You two will have to squeeze in a bit,” Gu Fei explained. “Er Miao, put
        your skateboard to the side.”
      </p>

      <p>
        This time, Jiang Cheng remembered to first put down the back of the
        driver’s seat before he got in and squeezed next to Gu Miao in the back
        seat.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao smiled at him, and seemed to be in a very jovial mood.</p>

      <p>
        After the door of the little bun closed, Jiang Cheng felt much warmer.
        He pulled at his clothes and carefully tidied up, hoping that they would
        all be dry by the time they got out of the car.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The clothes that I gave you to wear last time,” Gu Fei said as he
        drove. “I thought about it right, and it could be that I wore them when
        I read my self-reflection letter on the stage during the Monday morning
        assembly last semester.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s definitely not the reason,” Jiang Cheng said. “If it was Zhou
        Jing up there, don’t even mention reading a self-reflection letter, even
        if he were to read a whole pornographic novel, no one would remember
        what he wore.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei laughed out loud: “Thanks for the compliment.”</p>

      <p>
        “What did I compliment you on?” Jiang Cheng looked at the back of his
        head. “I think you might have to change your name. Let’s not call you
        freestyle handsome anymore, freestyle shameless is more appropriate.”
      </p>

      <p>“Sure, I’ll make a second account,” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “What sort of self-reflection did you read out loud <em>huh</em>?” Jiang
        Cheng asked after some thought.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Constantly climbing the wall to get into the school when I’m late and
        breaking a branch from that tree near the wall when I step on it…” Gu
        Fei said. “Just for that.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Jiang Cheng couldn’t help laughing. “Couldn’t you have just
        climbed another tree?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That one is the closest,” Gu Fei said. “Since I broke that branch,
        there have been fewer people climbing the wall nowadays. The wall around
        our school is too high, you can’t climb over without stepping on the
        tree.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything and only leaned against the window of
        the little bun, losing it to a fit of laughter not even knowing what he
        was laughing about.
      </p>

      <p>Actually, this was also very nice.</p>

      <p>
        When he didn’t overthink, Gu Fei was the only person who could let him
        completely relax.

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Wang Xu’s family restaurant had always been crowded in the early morning
        and to get a flatbread or two for breakfast was a great pleasure, if
        possible. When they arrived only to see that there was already no place
        to sit, they ended up sitting in the room where the family personally
        ate in.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “There are no donkey meat fillings this early. They’re normally made in
        the noontime,” Wang Xu said and brought over two baskets of stuffed
        flatbreads and a bowl of lamb soup. “Did you two leave together this
        morning?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The second that Wang Xu asked that, Jiang Cheng immediately felt a bit
        guilty and took a big bite of stuff-flatbread, opting to remain silent.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">“En,” Gu Fei responded.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “You’re just up so early today ah.” Wang Xu pushed a small basket in
        front of Gu Miao, “Isn’t it customary for you to be late… Miao Miao,
        there’s no donkey meat today. You can try another flavor today.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “What Miao Miao,” Gu Fei said. “Don’t be corny, okay.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Is it corny?” Wang Xu sat down and said while eating, “She’s a young
        little girl who should have been cute and pretty, but look at what
        you’ve done, you brought her up like a wild little boy. I don’t think
        I’ve ever seen her wear a dress.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “She wants to skateboard,” Gu Fei said. “How would she wear that, and
        even if we wanted her to wear one, she doesn’t want to.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “<em>Ai</em>,” Wang Xu sighed, and after taking a few bites, he took out
        his mobile phone again and swiped a few times with his finger; the phone
        made a clicking sound.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng glanced at him and found that the bastard’s camera was
        facing him: “What are you doing?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Just taking a photo. Maybe, if we renovate the front of the restaurant
        later on, we can hang it there as an advertisement.” Wang Xu smiled and
        put away his phone.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Fuck off.” Jiang Cheng looked at him, “Delete it.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “I’ve taken photos of so many people and nobody has ever told me to
        delete it,” Wang Xu said with determination. “I won’t delete it… I won’t
        hang it up at worst then.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was not in the mood to pay him any more attention and
        continued to eat the stuffed flatbreads instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        After they finished eating breakfast and walked out of the restaurant,
        Gu Miao had a foot on her skateboard and looked at Gu Fei. Gu Fei
        stooped to also look at her, “Do you remember where I said you can only
        skateboard at?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “Go on then. Gege has some things to do today, so I won’t be home for
        dinner,” Gu Fei said. “I’ll probably be home around the same time as
        yesterday.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao nodded again then turned to look at Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em> won’t be coming over to our house today. Something
        came up yesterday, so he had to come,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao still had her eyes on Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng could only stoop to look at her as well, “I’ll come to find
        you to play next time that I’m free?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao didn’t react.</p>

      <p>
        “You have to say the exact time,” Gu Fei said from the side. “If you
        only say, ‘next time’, she won’t understand it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then…” Jiang Cheng hesitated and thought about it for a while.
        “Tomorrow then. Tomorrow after the basketball game. Let’s have your
        brother bring you out to eat together with our team members, alright? We
        can sit in a row beside each other.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao finally nodded, stepped on her skateboard, and kicked off in the
        direction of their home.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Can we squeeze?” Wang Xu came out carrying his school bag and
        immediately became full of zeal at the sight of Gu Fei’s little bun.
        “Jiang Cheng, let’s squeeze in the back?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… is there even room to squeeze you in?” Jiang Cheng was a little
        dumbfounded since this car had only so much space, even squeezing in the
        back with Gu Miao was already strenuous.
      </p>

      <p>“Of course it’s possible,” Wang Xu said.</p>

      <p>
        Seeing the unwavering determination in riding in the car on his face,
        Jiang Cheng could only get in the car and move to the side as much as
        possible, and when Wang Xu squeezed in, this car sank, down, down even
        more.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei got in, he felt that the chassis was about to scrap the
        ground.
      </p>

      <p>“It’s not going to fall apart halfway right…” Jiang Cheng muttered.</p>

      <p>
        “It won’t.” Gu Fei turned the car around and drove toward the school. “I
        use it to haul heavy goods sometimes and there haven’t been any
        problems. The two of you together don’t even amount to much.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “But were you, yourself, also added?” Jiang Cheng said – with three
        grown guys squeezing in such a small bun, even people on the roadside
        turned for a look inside.
      </p>

      <p>“It’s warmer,” Wang Xu said.</p>

      <p>
        “Bullshit, it’s not even that cold anymore. The
        <em>Spring</em> Basketball Competition is named that way for a reason,”
        Jiang Cheng informed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>, that’s right. Practice, this afternoon?” Wang Xu asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng and I have something to do,” Gu Fei said. “I asked Li Yan
        and the others to come practice with you guys already.”
      </p>

      <p>“What are you guys going to do?” Wang Xu asked in more detail.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei ignored him. Wang Xu turned to look at Jiang Cheng, who was
        staring out the window pretending not to know.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Wang Xu tidied his clothes, somewhat in a bad mood. “Even
        keeping secrets <em>huh</em>, kids.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng noticed that Gu Fei was completely indifferent to everyone’s
        eyes; it didn’t matter that he had an old-fashioned little bun to get
        around or that there were three people squeezed inside, but he actually
        drove all the way into the school parking lot shed as though nobody else
        was present.
      </p>

      <p>
        And then got out amidst a throng of the students of Fourth High standing
        in a circle watching.
      </p>

      <p>
        “All eyes on you ah,” Wang Xu said as he climbed out of the car with an
        also seemingly indifferent tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps, not indifferent but rather delighted – after all, he was
        someone who wanted to be a big boss, and attention was what he needed.
      </p>

      <p>
        As for someone like Jiang Cheng, who didn’t like being surrounded by
        others and prone to anger with just a glance from others, he regretted
        getting out of the car without wearing a mask.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as he got out of the car, he could even hear a girl whispering
        from a meter away: “Is that Jiang Cheng?”
      </p>

      <p>“Yeah,” another girl answered.</p>

      <p>
        He didn’t hear what was said afterward. This sort of inquisitive and
        slightly excited tone made him a little uneasy, and he couldn’t help
        thinking of that fujoshi post – he started to become uncomfortable all
        over.
      </p>

      <p>
        “But I do think that it’s right for you two not to practice.” Wang Xu
        said as he walked to the school gate, “For the past two days, Class 2
        has been studying the video of our match and even asked people about
        Jiang Cheng’s ability. It’s best for us to stay a bit hidden. If we win
        tomorrow, we’ll go up against Class 2 after exams are over.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng answered.</p>

      <p>Wang Xu continued in high spirits: “I think our tactics…”</p>

      <p>
        “Cheng Cheng? Cheng Cheng?” A woman’s voice came from behind, “Jiang
        Cheng?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng froze and turned his head around.</p>

      <p>
        “You must be Jiang Cheng?” A woman was standing there, looking at him
        somewhat excitingly, “Right? I recognized you with just a glance. You
        really look alike…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng recognized the woman who was dressed a little dirty and
        appeared a bit filthy with just a glance – she was the one who fought
        with Li Baoguo in front of the building the day before.
      </p>

      <p>His biological mother.</p>

      <p>
        “You…” Jiang Cheng was caught off guard at this moment and didn’t even
        know what to say – he stood there frozen, looking at her.
      </p>

      <p>“Who is that?” Wang Xu asked beside him.</p>

      <p>
        “Class hasn’t started yet, right?” The woman limped over and reached out
        to grab his arm, “I’m…”
      </p>

      <p>
        This grab of hers was enacted with great strength; Jiang Cheng’s
        conditioned reflex plus the shock caused him to suddenly pull his arm
        back, shaking her off. “Don’t…”
      </p>

      <p><em>Don’t touch me.</em></p>

      <p>
        For the latter two words, Jiang Cheng had to bitterly clench his teeth
        to stop himself from saying them out loud.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The bell hasn’t rung yet,” the woman suddenly teared up. “Class hasn’t
        started yet, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        There were already many people looking over by now, and Jiang Cheng’s
        mind was in a chaotic mess. He had no idea how to face this woman, and
        after a frozen moment of silence, he handed his school bag to Gu Fei:
        “Help me… take this in.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei took his school bag.</p>

      <p>
        “Let’s go talk over there.” Jiang Cheng gestured with his chin toward
        the opposite side of the street.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh sure, sure.” The woman nodded; her eyes were glued to his face the
        whole time.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s going on? Should we…” Wang Xu was probably also blindsided by
        this scene that he wanted to follow after.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei reached out to stop him, “What does this have to do with you?
        Let’s go.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng crossed the street with a blank state of mind, and then
        stopped and turned around once he got to a corner with fewer people.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s mom,” the woman pointed at herself. Her finger jabbed repeatedly
        at her own chest, “I’m your mom… Li Baoguo never mentioned me, right? He
        definitely hasn’t, definitely not. The bastard that acts innocent would
        definitely not tell you……”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared with widened eyes, completely speechless. This
        seemingly pitiful woman and her vulgar words in her mouth made him
        momentarily unsure of what kind of reaction he should have.
      </p>

      <p>
        “When you were sent away back then, he didn’t discuss it with me at
        all…” the woman did not give him any room to speak and talked
        incessantly then started to cry midway, using the cuff of her shirt to
        wipe the tears. “I even thought of a name for you. Your brother is Li
        Hui and you would have been Li Ming or Li Guang<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>…
        but he sent you away. I fought with him and he beat me… that fucking
        dick…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I…” Jiang Cheng couldn’t describe how he felt and only thought of
        wanting to block out her voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        His usual technical skills were now being exerted to its maximum
        efficacy. In the past, when he did not want to listen to Shen Yiqing’s
        reprimands, he would let his mind wander elsewhere and whether or not he
        heard it, he would surely forget the content.
      </p>

      <p>But compared to the “biological mother” before him…</p>

      <p>
        “Come back with me!” The woman suddenly grabbed his arm and shook it
        violently, bringing him back to reality. “Come with mom!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t!” Jiang Cheng pulled away his arm and took two steps back, unable
        to suppress those two words, “Touch me!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… do you resent me?” The woman looked at him, “Resent that your
        biological mother doesn’t have money? Resent that I’ll make you lose
        face? Does your father have money?! He’s just waiting to spend your
        money!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m not,” Jiang Cheng said with a bit of effort. “I have to attend
        class now. I…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The family that took you is pretty rich, right?” The woman was not
        crying anymore, and her eyes now scanned him back up and down. It was
        hard to tell whether the look on her face was of disdain or sadness as
        she spoke, “Look at you, dressed just like a rich little master.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I have to go to class.” Jiang Cheng took a deep breath and turned
        toward the school gate.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re heartless!” The woman suddenly pounced on him and relentlessly
        beat him with her fist for a while. “You’re heartless! A home that’s not
        like home! A son that doesn’t recognize me! I have a cruel fate ah—”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you insane!” Jiang Cheng actually roared in rage, unable to take it
        anymore, and blocked her hands. “If you have any animosity with Li
        Baoguo, you two can go rip each other apart! I don’t fucking recognize
        either of you!!”
      </p>

      <p>
        After shouting those words, he turned around and walked away, but a
        couple of steps then turned completely into a full-blown sprint made it
        seem as if someone was chasing him from behind with a knife.
      </p>

      <p>
        The school gate was already closed. He didn’t stop and ran madly along
        the perimeter wall, and finally leaned against a tree by the road.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know if the woman had followed him and even if she did follow,
        it was impossible for her to keep up with him, however, he didn’t have
        the courage to turn around for a look.
      </p>

      <p>
        He froze for a while and then took his phone out to send Gu Fei a
        message.
      </p>

      <p>– Which part of the wall did you climb over?</p>

      <p>
        The perimeter wall around Fourth High was pretty high, with quite a few
        shops nearby that made it absolutely impossible to get over. But he
        desperately needed to get into the school now – desperately.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei’s reply came very quickly.</p>

      <p>
        – You can’t climb over that way anymore, but there’s a small shop by the
        back gate in the north that you can climb over; there’s a pile of broken
        bricks inside the perimeter wall.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng found the shop that Gu Fei mentioned; there was a dumpster
        set right next to the wall that he could use to climb into the wall and
        once he was on top of the wall, he could see where the pile of messy
        bricks was.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jumping down without some sort of standard could make him break his
        ankle at worst.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just jump,” the shop owner said, watching him from the side of the wall
        with his arms crossed, he then shouted: “There are no teachers at the
        moment, but give it a few minutes and someone will come by.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shit.” Jiang Cheng almost allowed that throat of his to startle him
        directly off the wall.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked around to make sure that no one was nearby and then jumped
        off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, he only stepped on some bricks and stumbled back a step or
        two without actually stepping into the cracks between the bricks.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he entered the classroom, Lao Xu was standing on the teacher’s
        platform while the students below ate their breakfast in unison. If
        someone didn’t know better, they would have thought that he was here to
        inspect the circumstances surrounding the distributions of breakfast.
      </p>

      <p>“You’re late?” Lao Xu looked at him in surprise.</p>

      <p>“I had to pee,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        When he sat on his seat, Gu Fei glanced at him but didn’t say anything.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck,” Jiang Cheng muttered.</p>

      <p>
        He very much wanted to say something, to curse, to complain, to find a
        place and yell a few times, and cry with utter consolation.
      </p>

      <p>But now, he could only sit there stunned and do nothing.</p>

      <p>Miserably enduring it.</p>

      <p>
        The suffocating fire was raging horrendously in his body, burning
        relentlessly until he could almost smell the scorching stench – this
        intense rage that he could not vent or endure was setting aflame
        unbearable pains.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wanted to talk to Gu Fei, but he also knew that anything Gu Fei said
        at this moment would only make him suddenly explode.
      </p>

      <p>
        Luckily, Gu Fei was a xuezha of superb emotional intelligence who buried
        himself in playing that retarded, retarded, retarded, retarded Craz3
        Match game without saying a word or even giving him a single glance.
      </p>

      <p>
        But sometimes life was just that ruthless. There were always people
        doing the most inappropriate things at the most inappropriate times –
        such people are called unfortunate souls.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng Cheng!” A strange voice came from outside the classroom door,
        “Cheng Cheng—”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng suddenly turned his head and saw that a certain member from
        Class 5 basketball team was passing by the back door with a wretched
        smile.
      </p>

      <p><em>This person wants to die. </em></p>

      <p>
        That was Gu Fei’s first reaction when he heard that fucking idiot’s
        voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng rose up in one bound out of his seat, and when his knee
        knocked into Gu Fei’s back as he jumped over from behind him, Gu Fei
        helplessly coughed while looking outside the classroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was extremely quick. Just as everyone in the class turned to
        look out, he had already flown out, grabbed that idiot by the collar,
        and landed a fist on the bridge of his nose.
      </p>

      <p>
        This punch was very heavy. Gu Fei recalled the last time that they
        fought; Jiang Cheng knew exactly what he was doing but this punch
        completely lacked control.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Wang Xu was the first to jump up. He propped his hand on the
        desk and leaped over, then propped his hand on another desk and leaped
        over the desk in front of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        All for the sake of getting in on the action, this person could raise
        his skills by at least three levels.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng’s second punch smashed the idiot’s face, the whole
        class had stood up and was squeezing toward outside the back door.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s going on, what’s going on?!” Lao Xu shouted as he tried to get
        out but was quickly pushed all the way to the back by the students
        rushing forward. “What’s going on?! Stop the fight! Stop the fight! Wang
        Xu! Go stop them!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That… how the hell do I do that!” Wang Xu’s voice came from within the
        hallway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stood up, dragged the chair behind the crowd by the door, stood
        on it, and looked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idiotic student had already fallen to the ground. Jiang Cheng had
        one hand gripping his throat while the other hand was swinging on his
        face. If it weren’t for the crowd shouting too loudly, they would have
        certainly heard the sounds of his fist connecting with skin.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idiot was from Class 5. He wasn’t the big boss from Class 5, but he
        was definitely a contender just like Wang Xu. With him being held down
        to the ground and beaten like this, the students from Class 5 quickly
        came over.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck!!” Someone shouted and prepared to rush over.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck who, huh?!!” Wang Xu bellowed in rage, pushed up his sleeves, and
        charged ahead. “You want to fuck me up? Come, come, come at me!”
      </p>

      <p>
        A brawl between the two classes suddenly started without any preparatory
        statements, not even trash-talking or warm-ups came – they went straight
        into full-blown combat.
      </p>

      <p>
        With the hallway packed with students, the deafening noises from
        onlookers, and the twelfth graders from the side, the few teachers on
        this floor couldn’t even maintain order, let alone find their own
        shadows in the crowd.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei jumped off the chair and squeezed his way in through the throng
        of people, avoiding several fists just to get to Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this time, the guy on the ground already had a bloodied face but
        perhaps because he was beaten so brutally that his fighting spirit was
        aroused, and he started swinging back at Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng,” Gu Fei called out to Jiang Cheng, but Jiang Cheng seemed
        to not have heard him. He frowned, “Cheng-<em>ge</em>! That’s enough!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he was about to pull Jiang Cheng up, a fist swung over from the
        guy on the ground, and although the target was Jiang Cheng’s face, it
        swiped Gu Fei’s face instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei suddenly grabbed Jiang Cheng’s arm and forcibly yanked him
        backward, causing him to stagger and fall to the ground then after, he
        firmly landed a slap on the face of the guy in the ground with the back
        of his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        With his ass now on the ground, Jiang Cheng finally recovered a bit of
        his sense amid this chaotic anger.
      </p>

      <p>
        The guy on the ground glared at him and got up, wanting to pounce at him
        again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei pointed at him, with the tip of his finger nearly touching his
        eye: “If you move even the slightest, I’ll put you in the hospital.”
      </p>

      <p>
        His voice was bitterly cold. The guy froze in place immediately, as if
        his emergency brakes were slammed hard on.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had never heard such a tone from Gu Fei before – so cold
        that he was immediately clear-headed and slowly stood up from the
        ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        The group fights around him were still in full swing, just like an
        unstoppable wildfire. He stood in the throng of the crowd and suddenly
        felt a little confused.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fe! Gu Fei!” Lao Xu managed, at last, to make himself visible in the
        utter chaos, “Gu Fei! Stop the fight! Stop the fight! Separate them!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t say anything as he conveniently went to grab the back
        collar of someone from Class 5 and pulled him back. The guy turned
        around and swung at him, but he caught the fist and shoved him to the
        side.
      </p>

      <p>
        After that, he grabbed Wang Xu’s collar, pulled him back, and pushed him
        away.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the fuck | You…” Wang Xu didn’t finish his curse and shut his
        mouth when he saw clearly that it was Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Tell your people to go back to class.” Gu Fei turned to glance at him
        and said in a calm and collected tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s enough!” Wang Xu shouted. “Everybody, stop! All of you from
        Class 8, get back to class!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei grabbed the arm of another person from Class 5 and shoved him to
        the side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Eventually, the students in the hallway slowly separated, and those who
        were entangled in the fight began to swear relentlessly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Get back to class!” Lao Lu’s voice suddenly reverberated; since the
        first period of the day was his class, he had probably been there for a
        while now though no one heard his roaring voice at all. “Did you all
        sleep too well last night?! You want to act out huh?! Come on! Whoever
        wants to satisfy their craving, raise your hand! How about having a go
        with me on the field! You!”
      </p>

      <p>
        He pointed at the guy who received a bloodied face from Jiang Cheng:
        “I’m talking about you! Look at your face decorated with blood! Are you
        happy now that you have open wounds?!<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Is that a
        morning glory or a sunflower?! What are you glaring at me for! Do you
        need me to carry you to the bathroom to wash your face?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone slowly went back to their respective classrooms accompanied by
        the sound of Lao Lu’s voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        With such a thrilling event this early in the morning, many people were
        a little unsatisfied; noises filled the classroom, some were just
        shouting, and some were curses from those that didn’t get to enjoy
        themselves to the fullest.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng sat back on his seat, still feeling a bit disoriented.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei also sat down. He rummaged through his school bag, took out a few
        Band-Aids, and threw them on the desk.
      </p>

      <p>“What are you doing?” Jiang Cheng glanced at him.</p>

      <p>“Hands,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked down at his own hands which had suffered from several
        scrapes at some point. He didn’t feel it at all – even now, he didn’t
        feel an ounce of pain.
      </p>

      <p>He peeled open two band-aids and stuck them on.</p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>, Jiang Cheng, Jiang Cheng…” Zhou Jing turned around full of
        excitement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng only had to give him a stare for him to obediently turn back
        and sit up properly in his seat without even finishing the sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng.” Lao Xu entered the classroom with a frown, “Come with me
        for a second.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng stood up and followed Lao Xu out of the classroom.</p>

      <p>
        “What’s going on with you huh?” Lao Xu asked as he led him down the
        stairs, “Why did you suddenly fight like that?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng kept silent.</p>

      <p>
        “Is it because of the game?” Lao Xu turned to ask again, “That doesn’t
        sound right. If it’s about the game, then Wang Xu would’ve been the
        first to take the lead.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng still didn’t say anything.</p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu walked him all the way to the side of the field before he stopped
        and sighed: “Jiang Cheng ah, you’re going to be taken to the Guidance
        Counselor office regarding this matter. You have to tell me what’s going
        on so that I can help talk to the Director of Academic Affairs for you.
        This kind of situation… adisciplinary punishment will be taken against
        you!”
      </p>

      <p><em>What’s so scary about being punished?</em></p>

      <p>
        He still carried his previous disciplinary actions with him to this day.
      </p>

      <p>
        Disciplinary punishments weren’t scary – the scary thing was that he
        didn’t know how to explain himself at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>I hit him because he was imitating how that woman spoke.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>You beat him because he imitated how that woman spoke?</em>
      </p>

      <p><em>Why?</em></p>

      <p><em>Because that woman is my biological mother?</em></p>

      <p>
        This matter was not that difficult to explain with some common sense,
        but for him, it was difficult.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at Lao Xu and then after a long while, he said:
        “Whatever.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p data-adtags-visited="true"></p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng considered Lao Xu to be quite responsible, but he really
        didn’t want to say anything, nor did he even know how to say it. Even if
        he made an effort to explain – because the person who lashed out from a
        single comment by another person was him – if he wanted to clearly
        explain the situation, he would have to simultaneously explain too many
        other things in the process, things he had no will to confront.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        In comparison, he would much rather take the punishment in silence,
        except he did feel quite sorry for Lao Xu, who sincerely worried about
        his students.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Lao Xu used half a lesson worth of time to patiently remonstrate him
        with a sincere and intense conviction – to move with logic, to touch
        with emotions.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Jiang Cheng felt as if Lao Xu’s
        tears were about to roll down his face. But in the end, he still wasn’t
        able to get an answer out of Jiang Cheng and had no choice but to let
        him return back to the classroom.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        When he arrived downstairs, the fuckhead from Class 5 coincidently
        walked out from the nurse’s office after treatment.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        It didn’t look like he was severely injured. There were several bruises
        and graze marks and the part that looked the worse was… swollen.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng had repeatedly beaten him with his right hand, so the
        fuckhead’s left eye was so swollen that there was only a crack left. His
        left cheek was also swollen, making him look sort of lopsided.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Once he saw Jiang Cheng, his one and one-fifth of an eye almost spewed
        out fire.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng paused his steps and stood still at the spot two to three
        metres away from the staircase, not taking another step forward.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “What?!” Fuckhead spat on the ground. “Weren’t you quite tough before?!
        Afraid now?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">Jiang Cheng did not respond.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Fuckhead eyed him from the two and two-fifth of an eye then walked up
        the stairs while spewing obscenities. Jiang Cheng continued to hear his
        voice until it lowered and eventually faded away and only then did he
        also slowly make his way up the stairs.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Lao Lu probably didn’t even get a chance to start his lesson for this
        period yet. When Jiang Cheng strolled into the classroom, he was
        standing behind the podium swearing, so loudly that the flakes of paint
        fell off from the ceiling above.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “The hero<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> is back!” When Lao Lu saw him enter,
        his teaching pointer instantly pointed toward him. “Jiang Cheng, let me
        give you a suggestion!”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng turned around to look at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Why don’t you write an essay about how to cross two groups of people
        and rush into the hallway yet walk out of a brawl completely unharmed!”
        Lao Lu roared, “Once you’re done, I’ll help you print it and stick it up
        in the classroom!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh,” Jiang Cheng responded somewhat helplessly and returned to his
        seat.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s not me who is being unfair,” Lao Lu’s teaching pointer danced
        across the podium, pointing left then right. “Every single one of you!
        Are only like a human being when you’re asleep! Once your eyes open, you
        become piles of shit! Never have I seen any of you do one thing that
        isn’t foul! Your parents work themselves to death only to support you
        pieces of shit to mess around in school…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did you go to the Director of Academics’ office?” Gu Fei asked with his
        head down while playing on his phone.
      </p>

      <p>“No,” Jiang Cheng answered.</p>

      <p>
        “They’ll probably get you all at once when school’s over then,” Gu Fei
        replied.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei was indeed pretty experienced.</p>

      <p>
        During the last few minutes before the final period ended, the Director
        of Academics, Lao Xu, and Class 5’s homeroom teacher all arrived and
        blocked the entrance to the hallway.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone who had taken part in the fight was dragged to the Director of
        Academics’ office without a single person left behind.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Director of Academics first gave them a good round of scolding, then
        after he was done, he made them confess to the reason for the fight. Not
        a single person in the group could give an explanation; they just joined
        in when they saw people fighting.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, the Director of Academics secured Jiang Cheng and Fuckhead
        as his targets.
      </p>

      <p>
        “He said you hit him,” the Director of Academics stared at Jiang Cheng.
        “Why?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Right. There must be a reason,” Lao Xu immediately chimed in. “Jiang
        Cheng’s marks are amongst the top ten of his grade, especially out of
        all the key senior high schools…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Xu-<em>laoshi</em>, I know that he’s a xueba,” the Director of
        Academics cut off Lao Xu’s words. “Wait for me to finish asking.”
      </p>

      <p>Lao Xu shut his mouth.</p>

      <p>But Jiang Cheng didn’t say a word from the beginning to the end.</p>

      <p>
        Just when the Director of Academics was about to flare up, Wang Xu
        raised his hand: “I know.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Speak.” The Director of Academics glanced at him, “I’ve never seen you
        this well-behaved in class before, not to mention, raising a hand.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “They came to our class and cursed at us,” Wang Xu explained. “Saying
        stuff like, ‘Cheng Cheng, Cheng Cheng, fuck your mother’. Anybody would
        blow up if they heard that, and they even said it in a weird tone…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What are you saying?!” Fuckhead shouted immediately after he heard
        that, “When did I ever curse at somebody?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You were cursing during morning study <em>ah</em>.” Wang Xu glared at
        him, “Otherwise, even a xueba would beat you up? Serves you right.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the fuck!” Fuckhead was furious, so much that his left eye even
        opened, “I…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Listen to him, Director!” Wang Xu became even more motivated, “Listen
        to him! He’s even cursing right now! He was cursing even louder during
        morning study. We all heard him! Why else would we all start fighting
        together? None of us are usually like this, but we do have a collective
        sense of honour!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Exactly! We all heard it!” The group of students that were dragged from
        Class 8 echoed in perfect unison.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You all heard shit!” Fuckhead’s face was thoroughly red as he turned to
        the students in his own class, “Did any of you hear anything?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nothing! He never even cursed!” The students from Class 5 also
        maintained unity.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Of course you guys didn’t hear him.” Gu Fei was at the very back of the
        room, leaning against an office desk, “There’s an entire classroom
        between us, and he was right beside Jiang Cheng when he cursed.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei!” Fuckhead pointed a finger toward Gu Fei but couldn’t get any
        words out for a long time.
      </p>

      <p>
        “They definitely heard you when you started screaming later on though,”
        Gu Fei snickered.
      </p>

      <p>“Enough,” the Director of Academics gave Gu Fei a glare.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took out his phone, lowered his head, and started playing once
        more.
      </p>

      <p>
        The truth was already made clear: Fuckhead cursed at somebody and got
        beaten up, which then triggered the fight between the two classes. Even
        if Fuckhead tried his best to protest, the Director of Academics didn’t
        think there was anything faulty with this conclusion.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a school like Si Zhong, as long as there was a fight, there wouldn’t
        be a single person who was completely innocent.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following that, the homeroom teachers of the two classes argued fiercely
        in accordance with their own logic, each piling the blame onto the
        other’s class. Lao Xu’s arguing was the same when he was teaching
        classes, without much vigour, but he really was wordy – once he started
        talking, there was no end to it. The other homeroom teacher was a female
        teacher; she started up a few times but couldn’t squeeze a thing in, so
        in the end, she just waved her hand, ‘seemingly’ in defeat: “Fine, I
        won’t say anymore. Xu Laoshi’s eloquence is really wasted on being a
        teacher.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re flattering me.” Lao Xu nodded his head in an extremely polite
        manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright, alright, there’s no need to fight.” The Director of Academics
        also had an exhausted expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, the final solution was for all those who participated in the
        fight to write a self-reflection paper with at least 800 words and clean
        two of the school’s washrooms for a week. The ones who started the
        fight, Jiang Cheng and Fuckhead, would have to go on stage during
        Monday’s morning assembly to read their self-reflection papers out loud
        to the entire school – it was to be a cautionary punishment after all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once they heard there were going to be disciplinary actions taken, both
        Lao Xu and Class 5’s homeroom teacher instantly grew agitated.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Director, I don’t think this matter is serious to the point where
        disciplinary actions are necessary.” Class 5’s homeroom teacher
        reasoned, “Besides, looking at the severity of the injuries, our class
        is…”
      </p>

      <p>“Right!” Lao Xu agreed in a loud voice.</p>

      <p>At this moment, Jiang Cheng seemed to see Lao Xu’s manifestation.</p>

      <p>
        But Lao Xu changed back to himself with the next sentence: “They’re all
        teenagers. It’s normal to be a little impulsive, and as educators and
        superiors, we mustn’t use this one-size-fits-all method sort of
        punishment on them. What effect would disciplinary actions possibly
        have? It’ll only leave a mark on their records. This method only reduces
        the workload of us educators, so I don’t agree with it. I believe that
        we should use our love and care, our patience, and…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Xu Laoshi… Xu Laoshi… Lao Xu…” The Director of Academics raised an
        Erkang hand<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> with a pained expression while the
        other hand was placed over his chest, “I know, I understand your good
        intentions…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “We as educators would definitely also feel very powerless when faced
        with so many children, but this is the career that we chose…” Lao Xu
        didn’t have any intention to stop, “Who didn’t have any impulses at this
        age? Look, the two of us were classmates, right? When you were in high
        school…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Xu Qicai!”<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> The Director of Academics cried, “I
        said I know now!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was originally in a pretty low mood, but now, he didn’t know
        how his mood suddenly became very good. Lao Xu’s words were pretty
        funny, but he still felt moved. A teacher like this could be counted as
        a type of luck if you could meet once in your life – even though Lao Xu
        was never able to find the correct way to communicate with his students
        because of his low EQ…
      </p>

      <p>
        But he really did want to laugh right now, and those with thoughts like
        this was certainly not just him. He already heard the unsuppressed
        giggles coming from Wang Xu’s side.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fine.” The Director of Academics downed two big gulps of water, “There
        won’t be any disciplinary actions taken at the moment, but there would
        be observations. If there are any disciplinary violations committed this
        semester then punishments would be added, and not just a cautionary one.
        It would be directly recorded.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Reporting,” Gu Fei called out from the back. “Why do I also have to
        write a self-reflection paper?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did you not fight?!” The Director of Academics slammed the cup onto the
        table.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng felt that he was about to reach his limit.</p>

      <p>“No,” Gu Fei replied. “I was breaking up the fight.”</p>

      <p>
        “I was the one who instructed him to break up the fight.” Lao Xu nodded
        his head and chimed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You hit me!” Fuckhead yelled, he was on the verge of stomping his feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who saw that?” Gu Fei narrowed his eyes and swept his gaze across the
        faces of the group of students present, “Who saw that I hit you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Fuckhead was so angry that his hand was trembling a little but remained
        silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What are you doing here if you weren’t part of the fight?!” The
        Director of Academics yelled directly at Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>“You guys dragged me here,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        “… you write one.” The Director of Academics shouted once more, “Go
        write about how I caught you being late and climbing over the wall this
        week! Go on stage and read it aloud with them as well!”
      </p>

      <p>
        When they exited the Director of Academics’ office, the moods of the
        students from the two classes seemed to be pretty low. Lao Xu escorted
        them all the way from the school gates to the parking shed, wanting to
        lecture them a little more but couldn’t successfully open his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        That was because the group had squatted in the parking shed and was
        laughing uncontrollably, unable to extricate themselves no matter what.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng still wanted to laugh a bit when he was seated in the small
        bun. He had to open a slit in the windows and let a little bit of wind
        blow in to clear his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We’re driving over to Ding Zhuxin’s place?” He asked after the car was
        driven a while.
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Gu Fei nodded, “Isn’t it convenient?”</p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>, I just want to ask. This sort of car is all driven by old
        people, but you’re a youngster driving this thing, would the police not
        care?” Jiang Cheng questioned.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Care about what? You’re thinking as if this place is like where you
        came from,” Gu Fei answered. “If they really blocked me then I would
        just tell them that I’m taking the car over to my grandfather. What’s
        there about it?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your grandfather knows how to drive this?” Jiang Cheng laughed as he
        asked.
      </p>

      <p>“Nope, he died a long time ago,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>“Ah.” Jiang Cheng paused for a bit and didn’t say anything else.</p>

      <p>
        “It was suicide.” Gu Fei stopped the car at a red light. He leaned
        against the back of the seat and said in a light voice, “He drank
        pesticide.”
      </p>

      <p>“Why?” Jiang Cheng was a little shocked.</p>

      <p>
        “Because he had a bastard of a son.” Gu Fei grew silent for a while
        after he spoke, then once the green light lit up, he drove out for
        another half a street before saying another sentence. “There’s plenty of
        fucked up people and fucked up things in this world, you just haven’t
        seen them yet.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng gazed at his silhouette and didn’t make a sound.</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t think too much,” Gu Fei said, “Live like a spectator, it would be
        a lot easier.”
      </p>

      <p>“Ah.” Jiang Cheng sounded then closed his eyes.</p>

      <p>
        Today, Ding Zhuxin wasn’t in the studio and there was only a girl busy
        organizing a pile of clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Xin Jie’s assistant, Xiao Lu.” Gu Fei introduced them, “This is Jiang
        Cheng, today’s model.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “So handsome… oh, I’m Lucia. He simplified it for me when he couldn’t
        read it properly.” Xiao Lu laughed a little then pointed at the two rows
        of clothes on the rack, “Those are today’s. They’ve all been matched up
        already. I’ll apply some makeup on you later.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Xiao Lu was putting makeup on Jiang Cheng, he glanced toward the
        clothes scheduled for today and felt that it was quite similar to the
        ones from yesterday – they were all either Dharma Master styles, or
        otherwise, beggar style. However, it was not knitted fabric, the
        majority of them were burlap… this made beggar style even more
        accurately beggar style.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Jiang Cheng was willing to wear these because, at the very least,
        the wind wasn’t coming at him from all directions.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay done, you really don’t need much makeup, to be honest.” Xiao Lu
        took a step to look over him, “Your face shape should be pretty
        photogenic, the outlines are very sharp.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You sure have a lot to say.” Gu Fei entered the room with the camera in
        his hands, “Okay, hurry up and change. It’s dead tiring to shoot until
        the evening every day.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s good now.” Xiao Lu clapped her hands, “I’ll leave the rest of the
        hard work to you guys now. I need to go to the warehouse. If anyone
        calls, help me answer it and tell them to call my cell.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay.” Gu Fei nodded his head.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng waited for Xiao Lu to leave before he walked up to the racks
        to take a look, wanting to pick a set that was easy on the eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “They all have to be shot,” Gu Fei leaned against the door frame. “It
        doesn’t matter if you wear one first or another last – you have to wear
        them all.”
      </p>

      <p>“… I know.” Jiang Cheng had no choice but to randomly pick a set.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei turned and walked back into the inner room. Jiang Cheng studied
        the clothes; this set had quite a lot of layers, not bad, at least it
        would be warm.
      </p>

      <p>
        He just had no idea why all the clothes Ding Zhuxin designed couldn’t be
        differentiated between men and women, or to put it another way – why
        they all looked like fucking women’s wear.
      </p>

      <p>
        This set did have a pair of baggy burlap pants, but the upper wear was a
        loose long top. Once he pulled it on, he felt like he should have a set
        of prayer beads in his hands as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei watched him enter and raised an eyebrow. “This set is
        pretty good.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t make me roast your beauty-standards.” Jiang Cheng stood under a
        set of already turned-on lights. Having the shooting experience from the
        previous day, he no longer had the awkward feeling of not knowing where
        to place his hands when he stood there.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Walk around casually, turn your body, and look back,” Gu Fei aimed the
        camera at him. “You can choose whether to smile or not.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng paced back and forth a few times in front of the lens: “This
        okay?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Great,” Gu Fei replied. “Let’s take a close-up of your profile and then
        you can go change.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why do we need a close-up of my profile?” Jiang Cheng looked at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You have a cut on your lips… don’t tell me that you haven’t noticed?”
        Gu Fei asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I noticed,” Jiang Cheng said. “What does that have to do with a profile
        close-up?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It looks quite good.” Gu Fei pressed the shutter, “Okay, you can go
        change now.”
      </p>

      <p>“No wait,” Jiang Cheng didn’t budge. “Why?”</p>

      <p>
        “I’m shooting for a personal piece,” Gu Fei replied. “Didn’t I take
        pictures of you before?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… fine.” Jiang Cheng walked out. His entire morning was extremely
        chaotic, he was too lazy to waste any mental energy now.
      </p>

      <p>
        He grabbed another set from the rack. He didn’t take a clear look at
        whatever the fuck the top was, but the bottom was actually a skirt. He
        first put the skirt on.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was a little speechless once he put it on; it was a skirt that wasn’t
        quite ankle-length but wasn’t quite calf-length either.
      </p>

      <p>But now, he already had a rough idea about Ding Zhuxin’s style.</p>

      <p>Basically, if it’s hard to figure out then just go bare-footed.</p>

      <p>But regarding the clothes…</p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei.” Jiang Cheng held up a mass of burlap as he walked in,
        shirtless, wearing a calf-length skirt on the bottom. “You two childhood
        friends, please explain to me what this thing is for?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En?” Gu Fei put down his camera and swept a glance across Jiang Cheng’s
        body. Jiang Cheng’s body was really not bad, especially that scar across
        his rib…
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng shook open the thing in his hands: “Is this the raw
        material? Has it not been processed?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at the large rectangular burlap in front of him and
        smiled, “I got it, give it to me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng tossed the fabric over to him. He caught it and brought it
        together into a strip, threw it over Jiang Cheng’s shoulder, and wrapped
        it twice.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck?” Jiang Cheng was dumbfounded, “This is a scarf?”</p>

      <p>
        “… no, but you can think of it that way.” Gu Fei tugged at the fabric
        for a long time and made the entire thing appear as if it was casually
        wrapped.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If somebody actually buys this thing then I will eat it,” Jiang Cheng
        remarked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This won’t necessarily be sold, probably just used to display the
        design concept.” Gu Fei backed two steps, “Alright, very sexy.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I feel like if I move, it will fall off.” Jiang Cheng stiffened his arm
        and pinched the fabric draped over his shoulder, “I can’t move.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can just run in front of me, don’t bother about whether it will
        fall off or not.” Gu Fei raised the camera.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was like a robot as he moved across the backdrop. Even
        though the movement was really funny, the smooth and firm back was still
        incredibly beautiful. Gu Fei pressed the shutter.
      </p>

      <p><em>Click.</em></p>

      <p>
        “Are you sick?” Jiang Cheng slanted his head back, but didn’t turn
        around, probably afraid that the large fabric would fall off, “Is this
        also for a personal piece?”
      </p>

      <p>“Yes, I didn’t even capture your face,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        “How come you have the same sort of behavior as Wang Xu?” Jiang Cheng
        finished positioning himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If I take a picture of you, you would be even more handsome,” Gu Fei
        replied. “But if he takes a picture of you, he could only rely on your
        face.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… hurry up! It’s about to fall!” Jiang Cheng had no idea what he should
        say to that.
      </p>

      <p>“Run,” Gu Fei ordered.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stiffened the upper part of his body and ran past the
        camera.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is it okay?” He turned to look at Gu Fei, the fabric on his body
        slipped off in a very smooth manner.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei clutched the camera and stared at him without saying a word.</p>

      <p>“Fine, I know.” Jiang Cheng sighed, “Was it a little…”</p>

      <p>“You ran like a chicken,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Jiang Cheng was a little disgruntled, “What the fuck are you
        saying?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Have you ever seen a chicken run before?” Gu Fei asked, “They don’t
        move their heads.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glared at him then squatted down after a few seconds,
        bursting into a round of laughter as he faced the ground. “Fuck, I won’t
        shoot this set anymore.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The pieces are going to be counted,” Gu Fei said with a laugh, “Be more
        dedicated.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He could only stand up again: “Fine, I’ll try my best to not run like a
        chicken later.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei walked over and picked up the burlap on the ground and wrapped it
        around his body again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t know if it was because he was shirtless, but when Gu
        Fei neared him, he felt Gu Fei’s breaths against his shoulder… the
        sensation made his heart beat faster.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the breaths had fanned past his face or brushed his ear, the sense of
        ambiguity wouldn’t be so obvious; but the shoulders are a place that
        wouldn’t be exposed this season, making it subconsciously become a
        private place on his body.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt a little stifled, but he didn’t clench his teeth, nor
        did he say a word, because he could tell that Gu Fei was being very
        careful. When he adjusted the fabric, he hadn’t touched him at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t want to become somebody so unreasonable and sensitive in Gu
        Fei’s eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright.” Gu Fei glanced a couple of times, “Start running from here,
        we can just manage to capture the scar.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What sort of hobby is taking pictures of scars?” Jiang Cheng
        questioned.
      </p>

      <p>
        “A ‘having survived many vicissitudes’…” Gu Fei raised the camera,
        “Little monk.”
      </p>

      <p>Just as Jiang Cheng wanted to retort, he then shouted again, “Run!”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had to lift his leg and run to the other side, and because
        he didn’t want to have to run for the third time, he ran without any
        scruples now. When he felt the fabric starting to slip off his body
        halfway, he ignored it and ran with wide strides, arriving at the other
        side with just a few steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he turned back, the piece of fabric had fallen on the spot in the
        middle.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei took a look at the camera screen: “Amazing.”</p>

      <p>
        Among the pictures taken was one where he was jumping into the air with
        his legs extending out and the “scarf” half-slipping off his body – it
        had a great feeling to it.
      </p>

      <p>“Can I change now?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Let’s take another static one.” Gu Fei pondered for a while then
        pointed to the single-person sofa at the back. “Sit there and just
        casually throw the fabric around you. If there’s more, then just toss it
        behind you.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng sat down.</p>

      <p>
        “Put your arms on the armrests at each side. Relax. The lazier the
        better.” Gu Fei gazed at him through the lens, “Put one leg on top of
        the other one.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ve never crossed my legs before.” Jiang Cheng crossed his legs, “Like
        this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Not like that, too girly,” Gu Fei said. “Cross your legs from that area
        around your ankles.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng crossed his legs according to what he said then he
        leaned back against the sofa and rested his head against the back. “Is
        this okay?”
      </p>

      <p>
        After Gu Fei pressed the shutter, he held up the camera and didn’t move.
      </p>

      <p>“Is it good now?” Jiang Cheng asked again.</p>

      <p>
        “It’s good now.” Gu Fei lowered the camera, “Can I edit this one a bit
        and send it into my Moments?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah?” Jiang Cheng was stunned. He knew that Gu Fei often posted
        pictures; there was Er Miao, sceneries, and many portraits. There were
        people he knew and people he didn’t know.
      </p>

      <p>
        “And the previous one too.” Gu Fei looked at him, “Is that alright?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah, it’s fine.” Jiang Cheng nodded. He thought for a while and asked,
        “Do you often make money by taking pictures for people?”
      </p>

      <p>“Not often,” Gu Fei answered. “It’s, always.”</p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng suddenly sighed with some emotions. This photoshoot
        was the first time he had ever made money in his life. Last year when
        Pan Zhi pulled him along to hand out flyers with him, saying to
        experience life, he didn’t even go. “You’re pretty awesome.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Bullshit,” Gu Fei simply replied. “My family has a lot of things we
        need to spend money on. It’s not enough to rely on that little shop and
        Gu Miao still has to take medicine.”
      </p>

      <p>“Your mom… doesn’t work?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “She’s too busy dating.” Gu Fei smiled, “She never worked again since my
        dad died.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything. This was the first time that Gu Fei had
        mentioned his father’s death – he really was dead.
      </p>

      <p><em>Then… how did he die?</em></p>

      <p>
        He recalled Li Baoguo’s words. Even though he didn’t believe him… he
        couldn’t ask either – unless one day Gu Fei willingly told him, just
        like how he was toward his own circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>I should change to another set</em>, Jiang Cheng walked out and
        quickly changed and came back in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took a glance and suddenly wanted to laugh. He didn’t know what
        Ding Zhuxin was thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        “A wild primitive person?” Jiang Cheng helplessly spun around, took out
        something from behind his waist and shook it. “It even comes with a
        slingshot? No offense, this slingshot is defective. It would definitely
        be crooked if used.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Really?” This set of clothes couldn’t even look good with a figure and
        face like Jiang Cheng’s. Gu Fei couldn’t hold back any longer; he put
        down the camera and burst out laughing. “Then let’s use yours.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Once this sentence left his lips, both he and Jiang Cheng simultaneously
        grew silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The room was so quiet that the spitting of a water bubble from the tap
        sounded like thunder.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei had a feeling.</p>

      <p>He was doomed.</p>

      <p><em>***</em></p>

      <p>The translators have something to say:</p>

      <p>
        Ice: Ahhhhh I am finally done with high school (and this chapter
        lololol). Damn Gu Fei is thirsty af, though I don’t really blame him… I
        also want to be able to drool over Jiang Cheng’s face and body…
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The room was still extremely quiet, but Gu Fei’s head was already filled
        with Jiang Cheng’s voice, all kinds of antics, all sorts of tones – he
        was completely immersed in the role.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        He, who had always been good at handling stalemate situations, felt that
        what he was facing at that moment was a dead end – as if a broad road<a
          href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
        leading to “a round of beatings” had opened right before his eyes.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Nobody knew that Jiang Cheng had a slingshot; the only time he displayed
        his slingshot was precisely that time by the lake. The. Empty. Of. All.
        People. Lake.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        He didn’t even have the chance to come up with an excuse so as to not
        admit anything.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say a word. He just stood across from him and stared
        at him without even a single expression on his face.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Since the sudden shock faded away, he had remained expressionless.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        He couldn’t even guess what Jiang Cheng’s emotional state was now.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “That…” But he still had to open his mouth, “That day…”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng didn’t speak – almost as if he was waiting for him to
        explain.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">“I was passing by,” Gu Fei mumbled.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “There aren’t any paths by that lake,” Jiang Cheng said. “I walked an
        entire lap around it.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “I really had something to do there.” Gu Fei finally found a somewhat
        mild way to phrase things, “I saw that you were playing with your
        slingshot and since we weren’t very close then, I didn’t go greet you
        and just left.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng gave him a look and tossed around the slingshot in his hand.
        When the slingshot fell back into his left hand after spinning two
        times, Gu Fei saw his right hand reaching toward the table by the side.
      </p>

      <p>Not good!</p>

      <p>
        He knew that on that table there were quite a few accessories as well
        as… buttons.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng was reaching precisely for the buttons.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei turned around, wanting to run behind the backdrop beside them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Those weren’t normal little buttons. Ding Zhuxin’s designs all made use
        of all sorts of “recyclable” materials, and that handful of wooden
        bead-shaped buttons were practically the perfect accompaniments for a
        slingshot.
      </p>

      <p>“That is what you meant by ‘spectator’?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei heard a swishing sound, following that was a burst of pain on his
        thigh – he had been hit by a wooden bead.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned around and saw that Jiang Cheng was once again pulling back
        the slingshot, standing in the same place with his eyes narrowed at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You…” He didn’t even get to finish speaking before Jiang Cheng released
        his hand. He screamed, “Ah!”
      </p>

      <p>The button hit him in his stomach.</p>

      <p>
        Truth be told, Jiang Cheng didn’t actually put much strength into it. If
        he had put in as much strength as the day he was making pits in the ice
        by the lake that day, he probably wouldn’t even have the ability to
        scream right now.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Didn’t you say that this slingshot was faulty and couldn’t shoot
        accurately?!” Gu Fei jumped over the sofa, hiding the lower half of his
        body behind the backrest.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That depends on who’s shooting.” Jiang Cheng took another button and
        squinted at him, “I can hit accurately even with two fingers and an
        elastic band.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t…” Gu Fei hadn’t finished speaking when Jiang Cheng released his
        hand yet again. The button hit his arm – now that really hurt. He
        vigorously rubbed his arm a few times, “Fuck!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The ‘spectator’ that you mentioned,” Jiang Cheng pulled taut the
        slingshot and looked at him from between the fork of the wood, “Is that
        kind of ‘spectator’, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It was just an example!” Gu Fei had gotten hit three times in a row; it
        really was getting hard to bear, so he raised his voice, “Do you have
        any sense of reason?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What sense of reason?!” Jiang Cheng bellowed, his hand was shaking
        incredibly hard, “What sense of reason?! You look on with cold eyes
        without a care, how at ease you must be <em>ah</em>!<a href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >
        What reason?! The world never had any sense of reason! Is there any
        reason for me being adopted?! What reason could there be for me to be
        sent to this motherfucking place right after I had just learned that I
        wasn’t a biological child?! What motherfucking reason?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>.” Gu Fei stepped out again from behind the sofa, “I
        really wasn’t doing it on purp—”
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t finish speaking – Jiang Cheng’s fourth button had hit his
        chest.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah!” He jumped up and fell back onto the sofa when he retreated. He
        might as well not get up anymore. He directed a yell at Jiang Cheng,
        “Come on, come on, Master Marksman Jiang Cheng! Come on! Hit me till
        you’re satisfied! If the buttons here aren’t enough then there’s more
        outside! There aren’t just wooden ones, there’s motherfucking stone ones
        and even metal and copper ones! How about you directly use the metal
        ones?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You saw everything.” Jiang Cheng glared at him for a while then dropped
        his hands and threw the slingshot and the buttons to the ground, “Right?
        You saw everything.”
      </p>

      <p>“I saw,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>“How much did you see?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “From when you were shooting holes in the ice, to Coach X, until you
        started crying,” Gu Fei mumbled. “I saw everything. I left the moment
        you started crying.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh.” Jiang Cheng sounded, leaning back against the wall.</p>

      <p>
        He saw everything – a brilliantly performed schizophrenic act with an
        added bonus of a grown guy weeping dejectedly.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng didn’t know what he felt at the moment.</p>

      <p>
        From shock to embarrassment, to feeling that he had made a fool of
        himself, to being humiliated about his secrets being seen, to finally
        indignant.
      </p>

      <p>
        And now, all those feelings had disappeared – leaving only the
        insufferable pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        His back was against the wall as he slowly crouched down to the floor
        and held his sunken head with his arms.
      </p>

      <p>This was the posture.</p>

      <p>
        Ever since he was little, it was not only when he cried that he liked to
        use this posture but also when he was in pain, depressed, or unhappy – a
        posture where he strenuously made himself into a ball and shrank as much
        as possible as to not let any other see him…
      </p>

      <p>… it made him feel secure.</p>

      <p>
        It was the same as sticking your head in the sand – different in
        approach but equally satisfying in result.
      </p>

      <p>
        It wasn’t that he actually thought others would not see him like this,
        he just didn’t want to see anyone or anything.
      </p>

      <p>Being unable to see anything, hear anything… was enough.</p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>,” Gu Fei called out to him, having walked up to his
        side at an unknown point and time.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge,</em> my ass.” Jiang Cheng muffled, burying himself
        between his knees and arms, “Are you fucking younger than me?”
      </p>

      <p>“I’m younger than you by a month,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        “You motherfucker.” Jiang Cheng was so shocked by that that he couldn’t
        even bury his head anymore, so he looked back up instead. “You even
        fucking know my birthday?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I saw your ID card when you fainted from the fever that day,” Gu Fei
        replied. “I brought a person back to my house without any rhyme or
        reason, shouldn’t I be clear about who that person is?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t bother with me next time.” Jiang Cheng once again buried himself
        within his knees.
      </p>

      <p>“Want one?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked out from the cracks between his arms; Gu Fei was
        holding a box of cigarettes in his hand. He closed his eyes, then after
        a few seconds, he reached out and took out a cigarette from the box.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You have to keep it a secret about smoking here.” Gu Fei also took out
        a cigarette and lit it up before handing over the lighter to him. “This
        studio forbids smoking since all the materials are flammable.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything as he lit the cigarette and turned to
        look at the security camera at the corner of the wall.
      </p>

      <p>“It’s fine. She normally doesn’t look at it,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Did you laugh?” Jiang Cheng asked; his voice was a little hoarse as if
        he had been greatly wronged. He cleared his throat uncomfortably, “…
        when you took a peek at me?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “In my head,” Gu Fei said. “It was pretty funny at first, and even if I
        said I didn’t, you wouldn’t believe it anyway.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng sighed softly. “I often play alone like that, even
        when I played the tin whistle back then. ‘Next, let us welcome the
        musical performance of the nameless tin whistle player, Jiang Cheng’.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed – so hard that the cigarette ash fell. He reached back to
        grab an empty beverage bottle and tap the ash inside it.
      </p>

      <p>“You’ve never played like that before?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “No.” Gu Fei shook his head, “But there’s definitely a lot of people
        that relieve their boredom that way. Someone made a post on Si Zhong’s
        forum in the past, saying that they can’t sleep at night without having
        a full-blown performance, and many people replied below that they had
        the same interest.”
      </p>

      <p>“Really…” Jiang Cheng laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “But it’s also good that you now know that I saw you.” Gu Fei stuck up
        his thumb, “I finally have a chance to say, Contestant Jiang Cheng, you
        are the most amazing person that I have ever seen with a slingshot.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… thanks.” Jiang Cheng picked up the slingshot that was thrown to the
        side and looked at it. “This is probably just a prop that’s not meant to
        be used.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “But wasn’t it still pretty accurate when you shot at me,” Gu Fei
        stated.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It wasn’t. It was only enough to hit, that’s all,” Jiang Cheng said.
        “When it hit you on the leg, I was actually aiming for your ass.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh.” Gu Fei turned to look at him, “Why?”</p>

      <p>
        “More meat on the ass,” Jiang Cheng said. “Less likely to get injured.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ve noticed that you’re always… highly self-aware. You don’t hold back
        your anger but won’t do anything major either.” Gu Fei tapped the
        cigarette ash in the container again.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Us <em>xueba</em> are always conscious of what we’re doing.” Jiang
        Cheng held the cigarette in his mouth, “We never fling someone against a
        tree.”
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck.” Gu Fei laughed again.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at the cigarette butt in his hand for a while: “What
        were you doing at the lakeside that day? It was fucking cold out, and
        there was no way through.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That day huh…” Gu Fei stopped, then continued after a long while. “That
        day was the anniversary of my father’s death. I went there to burn some
        paper money.”
      </p>

      <p>“Ah.” Jiang Cheng froze in shock.</p>

      <p>
        “That was where he drowned,” Gu Fei said, tapping his finger lightly on
        the container.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah.” Jiang Cheng remained in shock, hesitating several times before he
        spoke, “I thought the water wasn’t that deep.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s not that deep. He was drinking that day. If he hadn’t,” Gu Fei’s
        finger stopped against the container, “It probably would’ve been me who
        drowned.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng suddenly raised his head and stared at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        When Li Baoguo said that Gu Fei killed his father, he didn’t believe it
        at all – not one bit.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei said that his father drowned, he had only thought “ah, so it
        really was an accident”. But hearing Gu Fei, himself, say those words,
        he was so stunned that he almost couldn’t believe his own ears.
      </p>

      <p>
        “My dad was quite a bastard,” Gu Fei said very calmly. “I always wished
        that he would just die and get it over with. Even if Li Baoguo was my
        dad, I wouldn’t have thought that.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng remained silent, though his mind was a complete mess.</p>

      <p>
        “Though he wasn’t that much of a gambler like Li Baoguo, he was much
        better with his fists than Li Baoguo.” Gu Fei laughed, “My mom thought
        he was handsome and married him at the time, and then came the beatings.
        He would beat us when he was drunk and beat us even if he wasn’t. I’ve
        always thought that my dad’s only way of expressing himself was probably
        through his fist.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I heard Li Baoguo say that…” Jiang Cheng recalled each of Li Baoguo’s
        words. “He beat Gu Miao too.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei bit his lips. He had been very calm before, but his
        expression immediately changed at the mention of Gu Miao. “Gu Miao had
        always been a bit different from other kids ever since she was born.
        Maybe, it’s because he was constantly drinking… of course, he would
        never think that. He simply thought that they gave birth to a large
        annoyance, an inconvenience who couldn’t talk fluently or learn
        properly.”
      </p>

      <p>“So he just beat her?” Jiang Cheng’s anger rose as he listened.</p>

      <p>
        “Yeah.” Gu Fei turned his face to the side, “He grabbed her and flung
        her on the wall. After that time, Gu Miao no longer talked.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the fuck!” Jiang Cheng shouted, having the urge to dig up Gu Fei’s
        father’s grave and whip his corpse at that moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stopped talking, and the two of them both stared at the beverage
        bottle in silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a long while, Gu Fei finally said quietly to himself: “The way I
        fling people against trees, I got it from him, probably…”
      </p>

      <p>“Don’t talk nonsense,” Jiang Cheng cut him off immediately.</p>

      <p>
        “That tone.” Gu Fei laughed, “Why does it sound just like Lao Xu huh?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What tone should I use then, Lao Lu’s? I already don’t have the
        strength to yell anymore.” Jiang Cheng leaned back against the wall and
        sighed. “This place is really fucked up.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your adopted parents sheltered you pretty well, honestly.” Gu Fei said,
        “Even though it feels like you’re one of those bang snaps<a
          href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >, you’re still really… clean.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Probably,” Jiang Cheng said softly. He thought about it and tried to
        ask, “Why did Li Baoguo say that you… nevermind.”
      </p>

      <p>“That I killed my dad?” Gu Fei finished.</p>

      <p>
        “Ah.” Jiang Cheng suddenly felt that it was inappropriate for him to
        actually ask that at this time. “Don’t worry about it. I didn’t believe
        it. I was just… nevermind, take it as if I didn’t say anything. Don’t
        mind me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s not straightforward at all.” Gu Fei stuck up his pinky finger at
        him, “It’s nothing really, just rumours, of all sorts. We have many
        rumours around here. I’ll tell you about them when I have the time.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng nodded his head.</p>

      <p>
        “When my dad dragged us to the lakeside, someone saw us,” Gu Fei said.
        “And by the time someone came over, my dad was in the water, already
        motionless, and I was standing on the shore. It must have looked like
        the scene of a murder and the culprit wasn’t even crying, how savage.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s… you were probably scared.” Jiang Cheng frowned, not daring to
        imagine such a scene – how old was Gu Fei at that time?
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know, maybe.” Gu Fei lit another cigarette, “It might scare you
        if I say it.”
      </p>

      <p>“Say it, scare me,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “I couldn’t save him. I didn’t know how to swim, it was also freezing.”
        Gu Fei’s voice got lower, “But I also wanted him to die. I stood there
        and watched as he stopped moving little by little. I watched as he sank,
        just… looking on blankly.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng suddenly felt a bit breathless. He tried to take a couple of
        deep breaths but was unsuccessful as if he was tied up by something.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Quite terrible, isn’t it?” Gu Fei’s voice was very low with a nearly
        imperceptible tremor, “I was terrified. If I saved him, I was afraid
        that he would still want to kill me, afraid that he would kill Er Miao,
        kill my mom… if I didn’t save him, then I just had to stand there and
        watch him die, little by little… Every year, on the day he died, I’ve
        always felt like a layer of myself has been stripped off, never able to
        get through this hurdle for the rest of my life…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s hand that held the cigarette shook tremendously, and even the
        rising smoke seemed to struggle.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei.” Jiang Cheng had never expected Gu Fei to have such a story and
        was already shocked and at his wit’s end. But seeing Gu Fei completely
        different from his usually calm and unconcerned nature toward all
        things, his hands trembled along – not knowing what he should do
        himself. “Gu Fei…”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei turned to look at him.</p>

      <p>He wasn’t crying.</p>

      <p>
        Thank goodness. Jiang Cheng heaved a sigh of relief; even though he felt
        that Gu Fei was probably not like him, getting so easily emotional like
        a frail girl from just a little ache in his nose, he was still a bit
        worried.
      </p>

      <p>
        With Gu Fei’s eyes now on him, Jiang Cheng suddenly became even more at
        a loss of what to do. He raised his hands and hesitated for a long
        while, then finally placed his hands on Gu Fei’s shoulders and hugged
        him: “Cheng-<em>ge,</em> hug.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t struggle. He only lowered his head and rested his forehead
        on Jiang Cheng’s knees… of course, the majority of people weren’t like
        him – feeling as though he had been stabbed with a knife from just a
        simple touch.
      </p>

      <p>
        “To be honest… nevermind. I don’t know what to even say.” Jiang Cheng
        had never comforted anyone before; those that he wasn’t familiar with to
        a certain extent, he also didn’t want to comfort. Even Pan Zhi, who he
        had the greatest relationship with, didn’t need much comforting and had
        such a big heart that he could weather anything after eating,
        defecating, and having a good night of sleep. All he could do was keep
        on gently patting Gu Fei’s back and caressing it a few times. “Don’t
        worry. It’s all over now… it’s only normal for you to feel scared but
        that’s the past.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei kept his head down without moving.</p>

      <p>
        “Then what,” Jiang Cheng held him closer by the shoulder and lightly
        rubbed his arms once more. “You’re also considered to be someone who has
        experienced a major event, right? Before, my mom… my adopted mom, she
        always said that in a person’s life, any experience is valuable, whether
        good or bad…”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei still had his head lowered.</p>

      <p>
        While Jiang Cheng cerebrated on the words in his mind, he was anxious
        that his knowledge of comforting people did not match up to his title as
        a xueba.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just when he had no words to say, and could only incessantly caress Gu
        Fei’s back and arms, ready to say some sort of comforting childish words
        like “you’re safe, you’re safe, I’m caressing, caressing, caressing your
        hair, so don’t you be scared”<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>, Gu Fei finally
        moved and turned his face away.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You…” Jiang Cheng hastened to look at him but was stunned with just one
        glance, Gu Fei’s lips were curved at the corners – laughing. He quickly
        yanked back his arm and yelled at the top of his lungs, “Are you even
        fucking human?! You’re actually laughing?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah,” Gu Fei laughed even harder. “This is the first time that I’ve
        experienced such a clumsy attempt at comforting, I honestly couldn’t
        help it. I was pretty sad at first.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck off!” Jiang Cheng roared and jumped up from the floor, “Believe it
        or not, I can beat you until you’re sad again right now!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t, don’t, don’t…” Gu Fei also stood up and quickly kicked the
        slingshot on the floor to the side.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No, I was really worried about you just now. I was so anxious, I almost
        caressed your hair, you know!” Jiang Cheng was simply speechless. “You
        must be having a lot of fun playing with me. Should I give you a round
        of applause…”
      </p>

      <p>“Thank you,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “You’re welcome,” Jiang Cheng shot back out of a conditioned reflex and
        when he returned to his senses, he was disinclined to bother, “… you
        fucking asshole.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Really.” Gu Fei raised a hand and lightly tapped his finger on his
        shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything and inexplicably glanced over at his own
        shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>“Thank you.” Gu Fei came closer and hugged him, “Really.”</p>

      <p>
        Unlike the celebratory hug on the court that day, Gu Fei’s embrace this
        time was very tight and his conditioned reflexes failed to emerge.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Also,” Gu Fei said softly, holding him: “The ‘spectator’ that I was
        talking about, please use your xueba’s brain to think it over, not
        wallow in prejudice and use such a mindset to understand it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “My understanding, of course, isn’t muddled with prejudice,” Jiang Cheng
        said. He could smell the faint scent of tobacco on Gu Fei and suddenly
        felt that such a hug was quite comfortable. He couldn’t tell whether
        this sort of comfort was that of shamelessness, practicality, or
        something else. In short, he did not have the urge to push away Gu Fei.
        “When you saw me by the lake, you were thinking of yourself as a
        spectator, looking as someone cried, laughed, and broke into a complete
        nervous breakdown.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed for a good while: “Alright, I ‘<em>spectated</em>’ for a
        moment, but I didn’t think anything else or made fun of you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There it is,” Jiang Cheng said. “A bit of sincerity and this world
        brightens much more.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei patted him on the back then let him go: “I even thought that I
        was going to die by your hands today.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Not to such an extent…” Jiang Cheng sighed, “Although, I<em> am</em> a
        little worried now. It seems like I know too much…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No worries.” Gu Fei picked up the camera for a look, “I have photos of
        you in only your underwear.”
      </p>

      <p>“What?” Jiang Cheng stared at him.</p>

      <p>
        “I have. Photos. Of you. In only. Your underwear.” Gu Fei waved the
        camera, “With your face included, in high resolution and no pixelation.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You shameless bastard.” Jiang Cheng pointed at him, “I shouldn’t have
        comforted you. You’re such a pervert, do your classmates know this?”
      </p>

      <p>“My deskmate knows,” Gu Fei laughed.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng kept a straight face, but soon failed and burst out
        laughing.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wasn’t too concerned whether Gu Fei had photos of him in only his
        underwear – after all, it was just underwear, and it wasn’t like he
        didn’t wear one. In comparison, he was more concerned about…
      </p>

      <p>“And the photo of you running like a chicken,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“Delete it now!” Jiang Cheng roared.</p>

      <p>
        That’s right! He was much more concerned about the photo of him running
        like a chicken than of those underwear photos. If anyone saw that, it
        would really be humiliating.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I can do that,” Gu Fei bluntly answered. “Just help me write the
        self-reflection paper for Monday’s assembly.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glared at him then said a bit helplessly: “You can’t even
        write a self-reflection paper? With your behaviors, you must have
        written plenty since you were a kid, no?
      </p>

      <p>
        “I really can’t. I had Li Yan help write them for me before, also Zhou
        Jing, and practically anyone else I could get my hands on.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>.” Jiang Cheng poured himself a glass of water and took a
        few sips, “Honestly, I really admire you. Just getting by as you do now,
        and even being reckless with your self-reflection paper, what are you
        going to do about the university entrance exams?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re thinking too far ahead… there’s still more than a year to go,”
        Gu Fei said. “I haven’t thought about the university entrance exams. I
        just want to get my diploma.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then it would be pretty nice if you study at a technical secondary
        school.” Jiang Cheng glanced at him, “At least you can be skilled in a
        specialized area.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I have.” Gu Fei waved the camera in his hand again, thought about it,
        and smiled. “When I was in middle school, I honestly thought about
        applying to a university, but later, I felt that it was meaningless.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything. He felt that Gu Fei didn’t actually
        think that it was meaningless, however, considering the situations in
        his family, it was probably impossible for him to leave for school and
        there didn’t seem to be any reputable schools in the area to apply to…
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’ll probably get into an awesome university,” Gu Fei said. “But will
        the two years in a crappy school like Si Zhong affect you negatively?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It won’t.” Jiang Cheng downed the whole glass of water. “It’s nothing
        else than what’s in the textbooks. They’re all the same no matter who
        teaches them.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei gave him a thumbs up.</p>

      <p>
        “Perhaps, it’s to go against my mom… my adopted mom.” Jiang Cheng
        frowned, <em>although she’ll never know</em>, “That I’m not someone who
        would rot wherever I’m placed. I will go far away from here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah.” Gu Fei stretched his body, “This shitty place, no one wants to
        stay here.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        The set of clothes for the ‘demented primitive man’ was probably not the
        main hit of the collection; after only a few shots, Gu Fei had Jiang
        Cheng changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the inner room, he found all the wooden buttons that Jiang Cheng had
        deployed and placed them back on the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he thought about it, he ended up rubbing his arm again – that shot
        was a seriously hard one that would probably bruise at the very least.
        He sighed. How long had it been since someone hit him to the extent of
        actually leaving a mark on his body… yet in just half a semester alone,
        Jiang Cheng had not only unexpectedly bitten him but also chased to kill
        him with a slingshot.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>However</em>… he stretched his body – he was actually in a
        relatively good mood now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Yan and Ding Zhuxin were the only two people around him who knew the
        details of the situation in his family. He had never wanted to speak of
        this past with anyone as it made him feel uneasy – on edge. And, he
        wasn’t accustomed to receiving sympathy and comfort from others.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now that he had told Jiang Cheng, he suddenly felt extremely
        relaxed.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know whether it was because he had seen Jiang Cheng’s secret
        and needed to exchange, or he just wanted someone to talk to.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng hadn’t displayed any obvious sympathy and his attempt to
        comfort was a hideous mess, but it had made him feel completely at ease.
      </p>

      <p>He wasn’t teasing Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        He was truly sad at first, but it was also truly Jiang Cheng’s so-called
        ‘comfort’ that had actually made him unable to contain his laughter.
      </p>

      <p>“What the hell is this thing?” Jiang Cheng came in after changing.</p>

      <p>
        “I feel like you have to ask this sentence for every outfit,” Gu Fei
        said laughing.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Does Ding Zhuxin have her own brand? And is the brand called, ‘What the
        hell is this?’” Jiang Cheng spread open his arm to show the outfit,
        “What sort of mood are we trying for here?”
      </p>

      <p>
        This outfit was still made of burlap material; loose-fitted pants that
        were ‘designed’ with countless vertical cuts that were long and short,
        revealing his legs through the small and large slits every step he took.
      </p>

      <p>
        The top was a normal shirt, but the long sleeves had been snipped off,
        and those ‘snipped off’ sleeves were instead wrapped on the arm like
        gloves.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Looks pretty good.” Gu Fei lifted the camera and looked through the
        lens, “This outfit gives off an aura of stubbornness.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fine then.” Jiang Cheng turned and walked toward the set, “Why don’t
        you tell me what this aura of stubbornness is?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The second Jiang Cheng turned around, Gu Fei noticed that there were
        also several long slits on the back of the shirt, and when he moved, he
        could very clearly see his sturdy paraspinal muscles<a href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >… Gu Fei cleared his throat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just after divulging such a tragic past only for him to then react to
        someone’s back with a turn of his head, Spring really had come – the
        heat period of youth had arrived.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei turned around, pretending to play with the camera while actually
        tugging on his pants. He was wearing a thick pair of sweatpants that
        day; it shouldn’t be possible to make out anything. He didn’t want to
        keep on going to the bathroom to ‘meditate’.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Paraspinal muscles, or commonly known as tenderloins.<a href="#_ftn2"
            ><strong>[2]</strong></a
          ></em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        He raised the camera; thinking of it in such a way, all sense of
        aesthetic suddenly disappeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Raise your arms,” Gu Fei said after a couple of static shots of Jiang
        Cheng standing with his arms to the sides. “Raise both of them…not a
        surrendering posture, more like you’re blocking the sun…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ve never blocked the sun.” Jiang Cheng raised his right arm and held
        it in front of his forehead, “You could have just said the posture of
        wiping sweat.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng stood still: “Do you want a stubborn look?”</p>

      <p>
        “That look in your eyes when you hit me with the slingshot just now.” Gu
        Fei adjusted the distance; Jiang Cheng always had an aura of disdain,
        and when given prominence like this, it was very imposing, stubborn… no,
        but quite erotic. He cleared his throat again then bent his waist a
        little and pressed the shutter.
      </p>

      <p>“Done yet?” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “A little lower. I’ll take a full-body shot with only your mouth
        showing,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng kept his arms raised.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took a few steps and pressed the shutter: “And turn, with your
        face to the side, don’t move.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng complied.</p>

      <p>
        After those consecutive shots Jiang Cheng went out to change again, Gu
        Fei tugged on his sweatpants once more,
        <em>tenderloin, tenderloin, tenderloin… </em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The number of outfits that day was about the same as the day before, but
        because he was already quite proficient, and even if they had spent some
        time fighting and exchanging secrets, they were still able to finish up
        earlier.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei drove the small bun and took him to eat a bowl of noodles at a
        small shop nearby that was pretty good.
      </p>

      <p>
        On their way back after eating, Gu Fei didn’t forget to again say:
        “Remember to write my self-reflection paper <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What,” Jiang Cheng looked at the back of his head. “When did I agree to
        write it for you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It doesn’t need to be that long, otherwise it will suck big time to
        have to read all of it on stage,” Gu Fei said. “You probably don’t have
        any experience in reading a self-reflection paper in front of the whole
        school huh?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… no.” Jiang Cheng sighed, “And also no experience in cleaning the
        bathroom for a week.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s fine to just give it a casual clean here and there. The bathrooms
        are normally kept clean anyways,” Gu Fei said. “You know how to sweep
        the floor?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you think I’m a distressed young master of a wealthy family that’s
        been thrown out or something?” Jiang Cheng was a little dumbstruck, “My
        family… my adopted parents’ family is only slightly better off than the
        average-income families, there’s four of us including me. You actually
        think there’s a housekeeper?”
      </p>

      <p>“Are you still in contact with them?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “No,” Jiang Cheng’s brows twisted. “After the last time my things were
        sent to me, we haven’t been in contact since. What’s there to talk about
        anyways, how difficult life has been for me in this shithole of a
        place?”
      </p>

      <p>“Has it been that difficult?” Gu Fei laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “To be honest… it’s not too bad. At first, I felt like I couldn’t stay
        for even a second, and any second longer, I could have fought with Li
        Baoguo, but what’s the point? I’ve actually gotten a bit used to it by
        now. No one cares about me anyway. It’s almost like living alone.” Jiang
        Cheng looked outside of the window, “It’s also pretty fortunate of me to
        have known you.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei tilted his head.</p>

      <p>
        “Uh… knowing you all, you, Gu Miao, Jiuri…” Jiang Cheng quickly added,
        “Lao Xu is also very nice, and Lao Lu…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei started to laugh then said after a while: “I never thought that
        one day I’d ever meet someone like you. You’re different from my friends
        and classmates.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Really?” Jiang Cheng thought about it, “Is it because I’m better
        looking than you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I was born and raised here.” Gu Fei raised an arm and drew a circle in
        the air, “I’ve never left this place before high school, let alone
        traveled, and with all my relatives being here, there’s literally no
        chance to go out to visit them.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You never left this city before high school?” Jiang Cheng was a bit
        surprised, and frankly, he wouldn’t find it strange at all if Wang Xu,
        Zhou Jing, or the others had never left, but Gu Fei’s temperament was
        not like that of someone who was confined in this rotten city since he
        was a kid.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, I cut classes a few times in high school to travel around,” Gu Fei
        said. “But not too far though since I didn’t have enough money, and I
        couldn’t be out for too long either. It was mainly to take photographs…
        oh, I went to Starbucks once, but I didn’t know how to order when I got
        inside.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng started to laugh, and after laughing for a long while, he
        patted his own leg: “<em>Ai</em>, I’ve actually never been to Starbucks
        before. Do you know how to order there now?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah.” Gu Fei laughed and turned his head around to look at him, “If we
        have a chance to go one day, I’ll show you.”
      </p>

      <p>“Alright,” Jiang Cheng nodded with earnest.</p>

      <p>
        The two laughed once more and then after a moment, Jiang Cheng finally
        recovered: “Have you thought about leaving this place?”
      </p>

      <p>“I have,” Gu Fei said. “How could I not.”</p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng responded – the faint sense of loss in Gu Fei’s tone
        made him feel very sad – depressed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s see if there’s any chance in the future,” Gu Fei said. “Perhaps,
        when Gu Miao is a bit older. She’s very stubborn at the moment and can’t
        accept changes. A lot of the time, her thoughts are a complete mystery
        to me. You give her new clothes, a new hat, and she will be happy but if
        you change her comforter to a new one, she will get mad and cut them to
        pieces. You can’t touch her skateboard at all, she’s literally this
        close to hugging it to sleep. If the wheels break, you can only change
        the wheels, and if you buy her a new one, she will immediately smash it
        to the ground until it’s completely broken down… I don’t even know what
        she can or can’t accept. Just look, she has known Li Yan and the guys
        for so long and she still doesn’t really acknowledge them but with you,
        she likes you so much after only meeting once…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “So, that time I told you that your sister was with me, you didn’t
        believe it at all?” Jiang Cheng asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, she wouldn’t stay with strangers,” Gu Fei said with a smile. “In
        fact, she has a fixed route for skateboarding and is rather stubborn
        about it. Even if she goes to the train station, she won’t get lost. She
        knows how to get back from there… you sounded like a complete liar at
        the time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I thought you were like a psychopath,” Jiang Cheng also smiled but
        thought he could perceive Gu Fei’s helplessness. “With her like this,
        can she be treated?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’ll be difficult to see any significant changes,” Gu Fei said. “We
        can only take it slowly. It may take a few years for there to be a bit
        of progress. You can see how good she is at skateboarding, but she
        doesn’t comprehend two-digits additions and subtractions and sometimes
        even gets it wrong with numbers under ten.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>.” Jiang Cheng took out a cigarette and lit it, “I quite
        like her, and I don’t think she’s strange at all, not even a bit. She’s
        very handsome.”
      </p>

      <p>“More handsome than me?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Have a bit of shame, alright, comparing yourself to your own little
        sister.” Jiang Cheng was amused, “How can there be a person like you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why can’t I compare? I’ve always thought that I’m quite handsome,” Gu
        Fei relayed in all seriousness.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sure, sure, you’re ostentatiously_handsome.” Jiang Cheng stuck out his
        thumb and waved it beside Gu Fei’s face. “You’re the most handsome.”
      </p>

      <p>“Thank you,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“No…” Jiang Cheng bit back the last two words.</p>

      <p>
        When he returned to Li Baoguo’s place, there was still not a soul in
        sight, but Jiang Cheng thought that it was quite good this way. He
        didn’t want to stay alone with Li Baoguo, and even though it wasn’t
        awkward, it was dreadful – nonetheless.
      </p>

      <p>
        He thought of the woman from earlier that day, his biological mother. He
        didn’t even get a chance to ask her what her name was, and she also
        didn’t give him a chance to ask.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wondered whether or not she would go to the school again to block
        him, and just the very thought of that scared him. He had even thought
        of climbing over the wall to avoid having to enter through the main
        gate.
      </p>

      <p>
        He went into his own room, closed the door, sat down, and then started
        working on the assignments for that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        With not many assignments in Si Zhong, it wouldn’t take him long to
        complete. Even Jiang Cheng sometimes felt that the way the teachers
        assigned their assignments didn’t make too much sense and many of the
        key points discussed in class never actually appeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he finished his assignment, he sent a message to Pan Zhi, asking
        him to send images of all the materials used this semester – he planned
        on purchasing all of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        – I’ll ship them to you directly. Grandpa, are you going to get the
        highest score at Si Zhong this time?
      </p>

      <p>– It shouldn’t be a problem.</p>

      <p>– As expected of my Grandpa. I like this confidence!</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was honestly not that concerned about what his score or
        ranking was; he cared much more about whether he could actually do the
        work and how much he really understood, and only then, would he consider
        the score – naturally, the higher the score, the better. After all, his
        title as a xueba had already circulated and some people would even use
        it to tease him – a high score could make them all shut up completely.
      </p>

      <p>He put his assignments away and prepared to start his revision.</p>

      <p>
        He opened his book and while looking at the notes, he quietly said:
        “Now, our <em>Xueba</em> Jiang Cheng is preparing his revision, starting
        with English. His revisions have always been well planned out… starting
        with the most proficient subject will make it easier to establish a
        mental state of ‘everything is under your control’… alright, we will now
        maintain silence and see what sort of content is in his brain waves…”
      </p>

      <p>
        That night, Jiang Cheng looked at the materials until the early hours of
        one in the morning before he went to sleep, but when he woke up the next
        day, he was still energized. Perhaps, because it had been a long time
        since he had quietly studied like that that it felt as though he had
        returned to his old rhythm of life.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he got to the intersection, he glanced toward Gu Fei’s home but
        didn’t see Gu Fei; based on the time that Gu Fei normally arrived at
        school, he probably hadn’t even gotten up yet at this moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        His biological mother wasn’t waiting for him by the school gate to block
        him, which made Jiang Cheng quite relieved, but he still needed to find
        a time to ask Li Baoguo about it. He had to resolve this matter – living
        in fear and on edge every day was an infallible mean to baldness.
      </p>

      <p>
        As handsome as he was, he couldn’t afford that.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei missed the first class, and only after ten minutes into the
        second class, math class, did he wander in from the backdoor. Jiang
        Cheng was listening to the lecture while writing his self-reflection
        paper at that time.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei sat down next to him, he glanced at him and suddenly felt an
        inexplicable sense of… intimacy between the two of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe it was the fact that they had interacted more than with others, or
        perhaps it was the fact that they knew more of each other’s secrets than
        the others, or maybe it was because the day before they both had the
        feeling of “meeting you was an accident, but it was an incredibly lucky
        one”…
      </p>

      <p>
        “This afternoon’s game may be a bit difficult,” Gu Fei whispered. “I
        just saw external help outside, Class 7’s”.
      </p>

      <p>
        “They actually found help?” Jiang Cheng was stunned, “Isn’t that too
        shameless?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I guess there’s only two of them. I’ve played against them before, and
        they used underhanded methods so be careful this afternoon.” Gu Fei said
        and then added, “Let’s gather Jiuri and the others out for another round
        of practice at noon.”
      </p>

      <p>“En, the referee doesn’t care?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“Not really. The game being exciting is what matters,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Then, we…” Jiang Cheng was interrupted by the teacher at the podium
        before he could finish his sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng, you seem to be quite lively chatting over there. Why don’t
        you come up and solve this problem,” the teacher looked at him with an
        unhappy expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        The math teacher often called people up to solve problems, so everyone
        tended to be more restrained in this class, after all, no one wanted to
        foolishly stand up there for a few minutes with a piece of chalk only to
        then get scolded at.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stood up, and very slowly, looked over the question on the
        blackboard as he walked toward the podium.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei glanced at his desk; the book wasn’t even open and only a page of
        the unfinished self-reflection paper was on it.
      </p>

      <p>Was it time to reveal his xueba abilities?</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng went to the front, picked up a piece of chalk, broke it in
        half, and then continued to scan over the question.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s wrong, do you want to take the language class first? Can’t
        understand the question?” the teacher said with his arms folded.
      </p>

      <p>“Language class was last period,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>The very low sound of laughter came from the class.</p>

      <p>
        Just as the teacher was about to get angry, Jiang Cheng began to answer
        the question on the blackboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the perspective of xuezha like Gu Fei, he didn’t even know what the
        question was asking or what he needed to do. He just watched as Jiang
        Cheng worked out the problem, simultaneously jotting down rough notes on
        the blackboard to the side, and after a few moments, he completed it. He
        had even neatly erased the side notes before turning around and moving
        away from the podium.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s handwriting was very unsightly, even more unsightly than
        with a fountain pen. It was clear at a glance that his words were
        adopted<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>, but from the teacher’s expression, he
        could tell that Jiang Cheng had answered perfectly.
      </p>

      <p>“You should practice your handwriting,” the teacher said.</p>

      <p>
        “… this, it’s the result of having already practiced,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        The whole class suddenly burst into laughter, and the teacher was
        stunned for a long while before he knocked on the podium: “Quiet! Are
        every single one of you that excited to come up to answer some
        questions?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I thought that since you were writing the self-reflection paper, you
        wouldn’t be able to answer it.” Gu Fei lowered his head and took out his
        phone to play that Retarded Craz3 Match game.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Even if I was playing that retarded game the whole time, I could still
        answer it,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed for a while: “That shamelessness of yours is no less than
        mine.”
      </p>

      <p>
        At first, they wanted to practice after the noon classes ended to warm
        up for the afternoon’s match, but the Director of Academics blocked them
        at the door.
      </p>

      <p>Everyone had to clean the bathrooms first.</p>

      <p>
        Each was dealt according to the severity of their actions; those that
        were deemed as not serious had to clean the staff’s bathroom but for
        serious wrongdoers such as Jiang Cheng and the Fuckhead, they had to
        clean the students’ bathrooms where even breathing was hard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng normally held his breath when he had to use the bathroom –
        quickly urinate, quickly leave – that day, he had finally experienced
        the taste of the bathroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each and every single one of them all went to the bathroom in such a
        casual manner. Moreover, he usually prided himself on being able to
        urinate both stably and accurately. He didn’t know why every time he
        went to the school’s bathroom, there would always be someone who managed
        to urinate outside of the urinal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took a mop out of the stall where the cleaning supplies were
        placed, and the Fuckhead immediately snatched the other one; any of the
        Fuckhead’s people that went in could only grab a rag.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng couldn’t bear to see any more of the tragic expression on
        his face – the kind where one was soon to die a hero’s death – as he
        held the rag.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mopping the floor was relatively easy since there was no need to
        directly touch anything. Jiang Cheng and the Fuckhead started to immerse
        themselves in mopping on either side of the bathroom. Normally, at this
        time, they should already have a battle of words based on the Fuckhead’s
        character, but even breathing was a cruel action at this moment…
      </p>

      <p>
        In the bathroom, there were a few other students who were at first
        shocked seeing the two of them mopping the floor and wiping the walls
        but soon they started to laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What are you laughing at?!” The Director of Academics stood at the
        door, “If you all think it’s funny, then go and take their place! Or
        just start a fight right here! I’ll get you a mop.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had also mopped the floor at home; just slowly dragging it a
        few times as he played on his phone. Now was the first time in his life
        that he had been that engaged in quickly mopping the floor.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he dragged the mop toward the innermost stall, the door opened.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he was about to move the mop out of the way, the person inside
        stepped on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng straightened up and glanced at this person.<em
          >Yeah, definitely don’t know him.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ah</em>, it’s the god of the three-pointers, what a coincidence.”
        The person looked at him with a smirk, “You get the strength in your
        hands by dragging the mop in the bathroom as practice, huh? I could’ve
        never imagined this.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng gave the mop a tug, but the guy put his weight on it, so he
        wasn’t able to easily pull it away. He looked at the guy’s foot: “Move
        your hoof.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You think you’re pretty badass, huh?” The guy continued with that
        loathsome smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t want to speak in this kind of environment, so he held
        onto the mop without saying a word and just looked at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “In Si Zhong, if you want your basketball skills to speak for you,” the
        guy pointed a finger at him, “It’s far from your turn.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had always felt that he, himself, was a bit self-centered<a
          href="#_ftn6"
          >[6]</a
        >
        sometimes; although he took pleasure in it and didn’t want to change at
        all, that day, looking at the guy before him who had just walked out of
        the very last stall in this bathroom, a new understanding rained on him
        — there was someone <em>that </em>self-centered.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I usually use words to speak for myself, not my basketball skills,”
        Jiang Cheng said, putting up with the fact that the guy had pointed at
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You think you’re so funny huh?” The guy was obviously enraged, and once
        more used his finger to jab Jiang Cheng’s shoulder, “Stupid cunt.”
      </p>

      <p>
        This jab just so happened to land directly on Jiang Cheng’s ‘on’ switch.
      </p>

      <p>
        He raised his hand and firmly yanked on the handle of the mop, abruptly
        pulling the mop from under the guy’s feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        The guy swiftly swiveled backward and staggered back a few steps and
        balanced himself against the wall to avoid falling into the squat
        toilet. When he returned to his senses, he immediately pounced over with
        an expression hot with fury. “Fuck, I’ll…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Stop with this fuck this, fuck that crap.” Jiang Cheng stuck out the
        handle of the mop and pushed the very tip against the guy’s throat,
        forcing him to suddenly brake.
      </p>

      <p>
        Spring was such a humid time ah, why was each and every single one of
        them behaving like there was an explosive fuse on their heads…
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sighed to himself, roughly grabbed the guy’s collar in one
        swift move, and kept his voice low as to not be heard by the Director of
        Academics that was standing outside. “You must be from Class 7? You
        wanna let your basketball skills speak for you, right? I’ll wait for you
        to <em>speak</em> to me this afternoon.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Once he released his grip, the guy still wanted to come at him; Jiang
        Cheng immediately shouted toward the door: “Director! I’m done mopping,
        can I go?!”
      </p>

      <p>“Let me check!” The Director of Academics walked in.</p>

      <p>
        The guy could only glare at him then tidied his clothes and turned to
        leave.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he came out of the bathroom, Wang Xu and Gu Fei were waiting for
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as he came out, Wang Xu greeted him: “Did you run into Hu Jian
        just now?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hu Jian?” Jiang Cheng almost wanted to remind Wang Xu that it was
        Fujian<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>, but after a moment of stupor, he
        realized that Hu Jian was the name of the guy just then. “En, what’s
        up?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “He looked pretty pissed when he came out,” Wang Xu said. “There’s gonna
        be a good show this afternoon.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t worry,” Jiang Cheng said. “No matter how good the show might be,
        it won’t matter as much as winning a game.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Well said!” Wang Xu gave him a thumbs up, “Let’s go. We can go to
        practice in secret at the vocational school next door. I told my friends
        over there to leave a court for us.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Soon, a group of people walked out of the school gate, walking and
        chatting.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng and Gu Fei walked side by side behind everyone else,
        listening to Wang Xu excitedly talking about their tactics in tacit
        silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>What’s there to be tacit about silence,</em> Jiang Cheng felt that
        his own thoughts were a bit mysterious.
      </p>

      <p>
        “A man-to-man defense probably won’t work this afternoon,” Wang Xu said.
        “They have external help, at the very least one person, maybe two…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s fine if we can’t do that but you have to keep your eyes on us,” Gu
        Fei said. “Class 7’s skills aren’t as good as Class 5’s, and even if
        they have help, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they’ll work well
        together. After all, we’ve been practicing together for so long…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s right! Our teamwork now is pretty good,” Wang Xu waved his hand.
        “Then, how are we going to play this afternoon?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Make every effort to guard Cheng-<em>ge</em> and I so that we can
        score,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the sound of those words faded, everyone went silent and turned in
        harmony to look at Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>Even Jiang Cheng was stunned.</p>

      <p>
        “Me and…” Gu Fei cleared his throat and pointed at Jiang Cheng. “Him.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>!” Wang Xu very quickly followed up with a sentence,
        “En! I know! Pass to you and Cheng-<em>ge</em>!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng.” Jiang Cheng informed. He was actually not used to having
        a bunch of people calling him <em>Ge</em>, even though Pan Zhi called
        him Grandpa.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng, just Jiang Cheng. Jiang Cheng.” Wang Xu waved his hands,
        “We’re all buddies so let’s not care so much about formalities… let’s
        first head over to my place to get something to eat. I got my mom to
        prepare everything for us already. We can directly head over to the
        technical school to practice afterward.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wanted to ask when had they ever even had any formalities
        but set that question aside altogether. Having eaten so many delicious
        flatbreads from Wang Xu’s place, he was willing to ensure that Wang Xu’s
        spot as Class 8’s class tyrant was firmly secured.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they all arrived at Wang Xu’s shop in great vigour, Wang Xu’s
        mother had already finished packing up the flatbreads for them. Perhaps
        because Wang Xu had never done something along the lines of “leading a
        basketball team to victory” before in his life, his mother was very
        enthusiastic.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just eat first and then you can go. How uncomfortable would it be to
        eat with the wind blowing the entire way,” she commented.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No need, we’re in a hurry,” Wang Xu replied, “We’re short on time and
        heavy with responsibilities, you wouldn’t get it.”
      </p>

      <p>“Thank you, Auntie.” Jiang Cheng received the flatbreads.</p>

      <p>
        “You really have the best manners, so polite every time,” Wang Xu’s
        mother remarked with a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        The group didn’t stay any longer; they took the flatbreads and once
        again made their way to the technical school in great vigour as to not
        waste time.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei.” Wang Xu handed a bag of flatbreads to Gu Fei, “Beef and
        tenderloin, which type do you want?”
      </p>

      <p>“… beef,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        “The tenderloin one is also really delicious, didn’t you also like that
        one quite a bit last time?” Wang Xu asked.
      </p>

      <p>“I just want to eat the beef one today,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Then what about Jiang Cheng?” Wang Xu then passed the bag over to Jiang
        Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll try the tenderloin one.” Jiang Cheng picked up a tenderloin one
        according to Wang Xu’s suggestion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Beside them, Gu Fei suddenly choked and started coughing for a long
        time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took out his own water bottle from his bag: “Wanna drink
        some water?”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh.” Gu Fei took a few sips from the bottle.</p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>, that’s a pretty good bottle,” Wang Xu commented. “Sports
        style, you can tell at a glance that it’s used by athletes. I’m not
        judging you, but Jiang Cheng, you really are pretty good at being
        pretentious. No wonder a lot of people think you’re an eyesore.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… even a water bottle counts as being pretentious.” Jiang Cheng
        muttered, “Aren’t your standards for pretentious a little low?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s not like that,” Guo Xu piped up from the side. “We’re a small
        place here. Somebody like you who we can tell isn’t a local with just a
        glance is definitely from some big city. Your existence itself is
        pretentious.”
      </p>

      <p>Everybody voiced their agreement one after another.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng was somewhat speechless.</p>

      <p>
        The court at the technical school wasn’t as good as the one in Si Zhong,
        but everybody still squatted very seriously on the sidelines to discuss
        some tactics, and then diligently entered a practice game in accordance
        with the results of their discussion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Needless to say, when it came to learning in class for this group of
        people from Class 8, none of them were ever a good example. But after
        receiving some encouragement, the improvement they made in training was
        incredibly substantial. In the beginning, the players were running after
        the ball, but now, they already knew to have a few people cooperate to
        dribble the ball and to protect their teammates. Jiang Cheng was so
        touched that he even wanted to write a broadcasting script for them in
        English.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a match in the afternoon, so the first period of class was
        chaotic as expected, with nobody caring even the slightest. They
        practiced in the technical school until the first period of class was
        halfway over before they finally returned to school together.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were already a lot of people on the court, and this time, the team
        members from Class 8 that nobody had ever paid attention to before
        aroused the onlookers’ attention the moment they arrived. Jiang Cheng
        found that in just a couple of days, they had already accumulated quite
        a lot of “fans”.
      </p>

      <p>
        They didn’t even reach their class’s resting area when Wang Xu already
        unzipped his jacket in a charismatic manner. With a strip and a toss, it
        landed on Lu Xiaobin, who was standing beside him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Carry it yourself.” Lu Xiaobin wanted to chuck the clothing back at
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Help me carry it for a bit!” Wang Xu turned around and glared at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “… should’ve hired a full-time photographer for you,” Lu Xiaobin
        grumbled.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How come you have so much to say? I just made you help me carry my
        clothes for a bit and yet you’re so reluctant,” Wang Xu gave him a
        pointed look as he lectured. “Are you the captain, or am I the captain?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Lu Xiaobin didn’t say anything and simply turned his head to look
        elsewhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        What made Jiang Cheng dumbfounded was that both Lao Xu and Lao Lu had
        changed into sportswear and were standing at the sidelines waiting for
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This isn’t our external help, right?” Jiang Cheng couldn’t help but
        ask.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Actually,” Gu Fei also found it funny when he saw them. “Lao Xu and Lao
        Lu are both from our class, if they really do come up then we wouldn’t
        even need to call it external help… Lao Lu’s actually pretty good at
        basketball. There’s going to be a teacher’s basketball tournament later
        on, you can check it out.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The principal really does love basketball <em>ah</em>.” Jiang Cheng
        sighed with some emotion.
      </p>

      <p>Just as the words left their mouths, they spotted the principal.</p>

      <p>
        The principal’s surname was Liu. Jiang Cheng had never even talked to
        him one-on-one before, and now that he had suddenly stopped right in
        front of him, Jiang Cheng was given a scare. He noticed that there was a
        pimple growing on the side of Principal Liu’s nose… who knew if it had
        appeared because he was too excited about watching the game.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Student Jiang Cheng,” Principal Liu smiled as he patted Jiang Cheng’s
        shoulder. “Not bad, I saw the game you played, and might I say that you
        played extremely well. You can join our school’s basketball team with
        your level ah!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Principal Liu,” Wang Xu didn’t wait for Jiang Cheng’s reply when he cut
        in, “You can’t pat his shoulder.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I…” Jiang Cheng glared at Wang Xu. He felt that this guy’s brain wasn’t
        just missing a single chord, he was missing the entire instrument.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright, alright, no patting.” Principal Liu didn’t seem to mind; after
        praising him, he moved on to pat Gu Fei’s shoulder. “Your shoulder can
        be patted, right?”
      </p>

      <p>“Nope,” Gu Fei smiled.</p>

      <p>
        “You rascal.” Principal Liu smiled as he waved his finger at him, “It’s
        only when you’re playing basketball that I can find you easy on the
        eyes! You and Student Jiang Cheng can be considered the perfect
        partners, you two must come to the teachers’ competition next time!”
      </p>

      <p>“No,” Gu Fei continued to smile.</p>

      <p>
        Principal Liu waved his finger at him twice but didn’t say anything,
        thus he turned around to point to something at the back: “Reporter,
        interview this pair of dark horses!”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        A boy, who at a glance looked like a literary youth that even had a face
        full of acne, and a girl, who at a glance looked like a school gossiper
        and had a stature so small that she could take a sneak shot even when
        standing right in front of you, immediately rushed over.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hello, we are reporters from the school’s radio station.” The literary
        boy first took out an automatic camera, pointed it toward them, and
        snapped a bunch of shots. Then, he pulled out a small notebook, “We want
        to interview you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        This crappy school that didn’t even have as many tests as the other
        schools actually had a radio station? And even reporters?
      </p>

      <p>
        “… hello.” Jiang Cheng felt extremely bothered about having his face
        continually photographed without any warning; he wanted to snatch the
        fucking camera and see what shitty appearance he had been photographed
        into.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei immediately turned around and left.</p>

      <p>
        “Classmate Gu Fei,” the little gossiper grew a little anxious and
        hurriedly chased after him, shouting: “Classmate Gu Fei! I have a few
        questions to ask you…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Classmate Jiang Cheng,” the literary boy immediately blocked Jiang
        Cheng from going back to Class 8’s resting area. “Please answer some of
        my questions.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng kind of wanted to ask,
        <em>are your questions prepared in pairs?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        “The game your class played exceeded expectations,” the literary boy
        looked at him. “I want to ask…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wang Xu!” Jiang Cheng spotted Wang Xu, who was looking this way with
        very expectant eyes, “Captain!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Aye</em>! What is it?” Wang Xu rushed to his side at the speed of
        light.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This is a reporter from the school’s radio station,” Jiang Cheng
        introduced. “I think it’s better if his questions were answered by the
        captain. It’s the captain that’s the spirit of our team after all…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What questions?” Wang Xu immediately set his eyes on the reporter, “I
        can answer them.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng immediately evacuated the scene. The literary boy wanted to
        stop him but was blocked by Wang Xu. “Just ask, but I’m pretty tight on
        time, so you can just pick and ask the important ones.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The people from Class 7 had already arrived. Jiang Cheng was seated on a
        bench, trying his best not to look around at the phones and cameras
        pointed toward him and Gu Fei, and instead, stared at the players from
        Class 7.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you looking for Hu Jian?” Gu Fei asked as he changed his shoes
        beside him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is that their external help?” Jiang Cheng raised his chin. On that
        side, there was a man who had a buzz cut engraved with a wild boar
        design.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei also glanced at them, “There’s only one, who knows if
        there’ll be others coming later.”
      </p>

      <p>“Is he an underhanded person?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Quite underhanded.” Gu Fei answered, “When Bu Shi Hao Niao and I play
        with them, we lose more than half the time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at Gu Fei, somewhat taken aback; to tell the truth,
        with Bu Shi Hao Niao, Li Yan, and Gu Fei added together, the skill level
        of the six people combined should be able to completely sweep aside the
        average team under normal circumstances.
      </p>

      <p>
        “They will have some people who specialize in playing dirty,” Gu Fei
        explained. “Class 7 has a lot of substitutes, and the moment something
        goes wrong, they’ll definitely switch in someone to play dirty.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t worry,” Jiang Cheng shrugged off his jacket. “As long as they
        don’t start stabbing us with a knife, however many of them there are, is
        how many I’ll deal with.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You cover me,” Gu Fei said. “The cooperation between Jiuri and them is
        pretty good right now. We can definitely win even without having to play
        better than normal.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p><em>The perfect partners?</em></p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng kind of liked this form of address.</p>

      <p>“Smile.” Gu Fei turned his head.</p>

      <p>
        “En?” Jiang Cheng glanced at him then followed him in turning his head.
        He saw that Yi Jing was holding a camera toward them, so he smiled.
      </p>

      <p>
        The competitions being held now were all single games. To let everyone
        enjoy themselves to the fullest, the two games held every day would
        occur at different times, so now the court was densely packed<a
          href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >
        with both the players and the audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because there were no seats for the audience, everybody had crowded
        outside the sidelines to watch. Watching from up-close like this caused
        some people to be agitated, but that also incited excitement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had never played a game within such a tight encirclement
        before, and for some reason, his excitement rose. If only Pan Zhi was
        also here; with a Pan Zhi added to the court, the championship would be
        theirs for sure.
      </p>

      <p>The referee blew the whistle.</p>

      <p>
        The players from both sides entered the court and after the captains had
        chosen the courts, they jumped the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Class 8, it was Wang Xu who jumped the ball. Jiang Cheng didn’t want
        to waste the energy of their main forces on jumping the ball, even
        though compared to Wang Xu’s ability to grab the ball, Gu Fei was a far
        better option.
      </p>

      <p>“Jiuri,” Gu Fei followed behind Wang Xu. “We’re counting on you.”</p>

      <p>Wang Xu didn’t turn back and only hammered at his own chest.</p>

      <p>Boar Head didn’t go up. Class 7’s team was per normal as of now.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng exchanged a glance with Gu Fei and stretched his waist.</p>

      <p>
        The ball flew through the air the moment the whistle sounded, and in
        that split instant, the audience fell silent. Within that moment, the
        only sound that could be heard was Wang Xu’s furious cry and the sound
        of a hand slapping down on the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        And it was very encouraging to see that Wang Xu had slapped the ball
        directly toward Gu Fei’s direction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei reached out a hand and swiftly hooked the ball within his grasp.
        When he turned around, the people from Class 7 had already quickly run
        back to defend their net, leaving only Hu Jian at his side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei dribbled the ball and charged a step forward, Hu Jian followed
        after him, but he quickly passed the ball behind him with a backhanded
        shot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just when Jiang Cheng caught the ball, Gu Fei had already shot forward.
        Jiang Cheng swiftly caught up and first passed the ball to Guo Xu. Guo
        Xu then caught the ball but didn’t continue dribbling; he just took a
        few steps before passing the ball back to Gu Fei who had already made it
        past the three-point line.
      </p>

      <p>This pace wasn’t too shabby.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng gave this group of people a thumbs up in his heart; the them
        from half a month ago couldn’t possibly display such a level of
        cooperation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 7’s encirclement quickly shrunk to defend. The speed was pretty
        fast, but truth be told, it couldn’t compare to Class 5. After all,
        Class 5 was a strong team that was second only to Class 2. Considering
        how they were eliminated without any mental preparation, they must be
        pretty aggrieved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stepped forward onto the three-point line and raised the ball.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng rushed over and gave a suppressed shout: “Here!”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei flicked his wrist and passed the ball over. Jiang Cheng caught
        the ball with a leap then immediately followed up with a three-pointer
        before the people from Class 7 could even react.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was very nervous when he took the shot; this was the first
        shot of the game – it must go in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Good thing he had always been a xueba, possessing the professional
        mentality of someone who had perfected the skill of showing-off…
      </p>

      <p>The ball went in.</p>

      <p>
        A wave of cheers instantly erupted from Class 8’s resting area,
        spreading outwards to the entire audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was Class 7’s turn to take the ball. Gu Fei was running back in front
        of him and his arms were hanging at his sides with his palms facing
        behind him.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng ran over and lightly patted his hand.</p>

      <p>
        Just when Gu Fei was about to withdraw his hand, Wang Xu also ran over
        and slapped his hand with a <em>pa</em> sound: “That was great!”
      </p>

      <p>“Ah!” Gu Fei jumped up in shock.</p>

      <p>“Pay attention to defense!” Jiang Cheng shouted.</p>

      <p>
        Just when the new round began, they had let the opponent score a goal.
        The people from Class 7’s wills to fight were immediately aroused and
        headed by Hu Jian; they immediately started pressing back once they got
        the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        In light of the agreement “let’s use our basketball skills to speak”
        they had at noon, Jiang Cheng went over to greet Hu Jian by blocking
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had no understanding of Hu Jian’s ability, nor did he take his brash
        trash talk to heart, but in Jiang Cheng’s eyes, the only people that
        could snatch the ball away from him were Gu Fei and Li Yan – there were
        no other exceptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hu Jian could be called agile and had a lot of tricks up his sleeves, so
        Jiang Cheng remained where he stood and closely watched as he swayed
        forward one moment, backward the next, left one moment, and then right
        the next. He was honestly a little tempted to remind him not to waste
        too much energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he had swayed till he felt that it was about time for the referee
        to blow the whistle, Hu Jian suddenly faked to the left and charged with
        the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sighed. He took a step over, reached out, and gave the ball
        a shove – the ball immediately changed direction and bounced away. Over
        on that side, Wang Xu caught the ball and turned around, dribbling the
        ball over to their net.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the shock, the people from Class 7 were slower by a beat. Wang Xu
        rushed over with the ball, full of spirit and surrounded by various
        kinds of shouts, he reached the net and pressed passed the only defender
        there and did a layup.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Good shot!” Wang Xu, who had scored two points, roared with clenched
        fists and eyes widened into circles, “Good shot!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to Class 5, the skill level of Class 7 was much worse. At the
        end of the first quarter, they were already 6 points ahead.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Look,” Wang Xu took two gulps of water and peered at the other side
        during the break. “Class 2 is staring at us right now, our number one
        opponent.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Class 5 is even cheering for Class 7 right now,” Lu Xiaobin remarked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “There isn’t anything to change up later.” Jiang Cheng took a few looks
        at the other side, “Just continue playing as we did just now. Keep at
        it.”
      </p>

      <p>“They’ve switched people,” Gu Fei commented.</p>

      <p>
        The few of them all turned to look over in that direction. Class 7 had
        switched in two people; one of them was a big man with a face shining
        with grease, and the other was Boar Head.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Try not to have physical contact with them,” Jiang Cheng instructed.
        “Pass the ball more, and immediately make a pass when somebody comes
        near you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        According to what Gu Fei said, Boar Head was here to help snatch points
        and that Grease Face should be here to play dirty. Class 7 really did
        have many substitutes; it had taken Class 8 a lot of effort to even find
        three to five of them, yet there were enough people donning uniforms on
        Class 7’s bench to play a game of soccer.
      </p>

      <p>Class 7 took the ball and then directly passed it to Boar Head.</p>

      <p>
        Boar Head charged toward the net with the ball like a tank, and although
        his speed was shocking, his dribbling was very steady. When Jiang Cheng
        cut over to block him, he abruptly stopped without making any feints and
        directly slammed Jiang Cheng’s arm aside to continue charging forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng wanted to obstruct him again, Grease Face came over and
        slammed right into him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had wanted to make a sidestep and avoid him to continue forward, but
        Grease Face’s shoulder had already hit his right shoulder and slammed
        into him extremely hard in a not-very-concealed manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was struck so hard by him that he almost flew to the side.
        After a period of numbness, his shoulder started throbbing in pain,
        causing his eyebrows to furrow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Generally, in this kind of class game, as long as a ‘loose ball foul’<a
          href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >
        wasn’t grabbing somebody’s arm and preventing them from moving, the
        referee basically wouldn’t blow the whistle – they may not even notice
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Jiang Cheng was knocked aside, Boar Head had already made it to
        the net. Gu Fei was trapped by two people, unable to prevent anything,
        letting Boar Head succeed in scoring a shot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 7 suddenly burst into cheers, and a group of people started
        knocking on the ground with their stools.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Be bolder!” Lao Lu’s voice abruptly rang out and was even accompanied
        by the music from a sprinkler.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced over and caught sight of Lao Lu holding a
        loudspeaker. Who knew why he didn’t turn off the speaker’s music, but
        the music continued to play like a BGM.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Lu continued to yell with his arms akimbo: “Be more unrestrained! If
        other people hit you! Just hit them right back! Boldly…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Lu Laoshi! Lu Laoshi!” The Principal also raised a loudspeaker from the
        referee’s bench, “You are disturbing the game. Class 8, this is a
        technical foul!”<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu snatched away Lao Lu’s loudspeaker and passed it to a student
        behind him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m going to start ramming people,” Gu Fei said as he ran over to Jiang
        Cheng’s side. “You just have to shake off Zhang Wei and score points.”
      </p>

      <p>“Is that Grease Face?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei swept a glance at Grease Face: “… yes.”</p>

      <p>“Actually, that isn’t necessary,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>“You only have to focus on scoring,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s ramming target was Boar Head, Jiang Cheng didn’t even have to
        ask to know. Currently, this fella and Grease Face were working together
        pretty well – one person obstructing and the other person going on
        offense.
      </p>

      <p>
        This made him a little annoyed.
        <em
          >The perfect, perfect partners are here ne<a href="#_ftn5"
            ><strong>[5]</strong></a
          >, who do you think you are?</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        However, he didn’t support deliberate fouls. He just didn’t have the
        chance to speak more with Gu Fei about it, he could only play first.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was guarding on the centerline. When Class 7 got their hands
        on the ball, they quickly went on offense, giving the ball to Boar Head
        as expected. Gu Fei didn’t find a chance to ram into him and was
        actually trapped by two people once again so he couldn’t go on defense.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t care about all that. He directly cut over and
        forcibly rushed forward from between the two people. After Gu Fei also
        escaped, he turned, and the two blocked Boar Head’s path together.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that obstacle, Jiang Cheng clapped, cheered, and screamed for him and
        Gu Fei in his heart. When the two of them stood firm at the same time,
        Boar Head was still a step away from them, he couldn’t employ a
        defensive foul.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>
      </p>

      <p>It was perfect.</p>

      <p>
        But Boar Head wasn’t an amateur. He didn’t directly charge forward and
        had instead chosen to make a shot right in front of two players with
        similar heights to him from the opposing team with a fair amount of
        confidence.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei and Jiang Cheng jumped up at the same time to slap down the ball.
      </p>

      <p>The ball was sent flying and landed in Lu Xiaobin’s hands.</p>

      <p>
        This blocked shot<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> was done beautifully. Jiang
        Cheng once again fell into a round of internal praises, especially about
        the tacit cooperation between him and Gu Fei. It made him play
        incredibly comfortably.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the screams from the mass of girls on the sidelines made him rather
        uncomfortable; there was always a sense of guilt like he was being
        caught on the spot.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know how he had become so unpromising.<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        When Lu Xiaobin caught the ball, he quickly cooperated with everyone to
        go on offense. Jiang Cheng and Gu Fei were pretty much wrapped around
        Boar Head; like his shadows, they made him completely unable to
        intercept the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other side, Lu Xiaobin and Wang Xu passed the ball without pause,
        faultlessly disrupting the rhythm of Class 7’s defense. Wang Xu caught
        the ball and with another cry, scored another two points.
      </p>

      <p>
        When there were only a few minutes left in the first half of the game,
        Class 7 called for a break.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck,” Gu Fei patted his hand. “Jiuri’s gone crazy.”</p>

      <p>
        “He is our captain after all,” Jiang Cheng remarked. “Do you think he’d
        let you steal all the spotlight?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “We managed to push through the first half, it’s still very hard for
        them to catch up to our scores now,” Gu Fei said. “It’s not very easy to
        hit them. He’s too familiar with me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “We can win even without hitting them.” Jiang Cheng looked at him. His
        gaze landed on Gu Fei’s neck, then on his collarbone, to the shoulder,
        then when it went all the way down to his arm, he became dumbfounded.
        “Is this from getting hit?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei lowered his head to glance at his arm: “This was from the
        slingshot and the wooden bead. There’s also one on my stomach, do you
        want to see?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No.” Jiang Cheng was a little speechless, “Aren’t you a little too
        delicate… I shouldn’t have used much strength…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “This is flesh <em>ah</em>,” Gu Fei patted his arm. “Not a tree trunk.”
      </p>

      <p>“… sorry about that.” Jiang Cheng sighed.</p>

      <p>
        “It’s fine.” Gu Fei took the water from Jing Yi, “Think of it as me
        paying my entrance fees.”
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck.” Jiang Cheng swore with clenched teeth.</p>

      <p>
        The first half of the game wasn’t actually very difficult to play. Class
        7 only depended on Boar Head, an external help, and didn’t actually
        improve on their own skills. In twenty minutes, Jiang Cheng was able to
        tell that Hu Jian was only an overly self-confident teenager with middle
        school syndrome. His skills weren’t much better than Wang Xu’s. If they
        were to really speak with their basketball skills, then he was a mute at
        most.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when the second half started, Class 7 went on a rampage like they
        had all gotten shots. They were probably giving their last efforts –
        even if they couldn’t win, they couldn’t let the difference in their
        scores be too large.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t care about the other people. Even if they switched in
        the people committing fouls, they wouldn’t dare to casually make a foul
        on offense. As long as they could score, the other people weren’t worth
        paying attention to, only Boar Head.
      </p>

      <p>That person had the ability but also had thick-skin.</p>

      <p>
        When Lu Xiaobin got the ball and pressed forward to the opponents’
        basket, he passed it to Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        Actually, that wasn’t a very good timing. Gu Fei didn’t have the time to
        cover, and on the contrary, Boar Head had rushed up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng lowered his center of gravity, switched the ball from his
        right to his left, and used his body to guard the ball. Boar Head had
        come over and blocked his right, he continuously squeezed his way over
        and inconspicuously elbowed him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was growing irritated at him, but in this situation, if the
        referee didn’t blow the whistle, y<em
          >ou must keep your mind steady and continue to keep a firm grasp of
          control.</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Good thing Gu Fei had quickly made his way over and was ready to
        respond.
      </p>

      <p>
        Out of the corner of his eye, Jiang Cheng’s gaze swept over Gu Fei’s
        shoes, and with a sweep of his arm, he passed the ball over to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        But right at that moment, Boar Head aggressively jumped forward, his
        right arm making a motion of stealing the ball. However, Jiang Cheng
        immediately knew that he didn’t intend on stealing the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he stretched out his right hand, his left elbow made a heavy blow on
        Jiang Cheng’s stomach with inertia.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Jiang Cheng’s cry had come from between the gaps of his clenched
        teeth.
      </p>

      <p>
        After this hit landed, an unbearable pain along with a strong urge to
        vomit rose from his stomach, making his world suddenly go white. He
        almost fell to his knees with soft legs.
      </p>

      <p>
        His mind was messed up by the pain; so many voices were simultaneously
        crying in his head —<em
          >My injured heart really,really hurts! Why am I always the one that
          gets hurt?! Aaaaahhhh it’s always fucking me!</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        The referee blew the whistle: “Blocking foul!”<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>
      </p>

      <p>Boar Head gave a breezy smile and raised his hand.</p>

      <p>
        The audience didn’t see the situation clearly and only thought it was a
        normal collision. Only the team members from Class 2 jeered, some even
        pointed and waved their dumbs downwards.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Wang Xu was right behind Jiang Cheng and rushed over to support
        him. “How is it? Is it serious?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s fine.” Jiang Cheng finally managed to rasp out after a long time.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei walked over without a word and directly lifted up his shirt.</p>

      <p>
        Although he didn’t react much to Gu Fei’s touch anymore, he almost
        slapped him for such a drastic action.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You really are an underhanded person <em>ah</em>.” Gu Fei turned to
        face Boar Head.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What,” Boar Head gave a cold laugh, “Have I touched porcelain<a
          href="#_ftn10"
          >[10]</a
        >, <em>huh</em>? Could I possibly be as underhanded as you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t say a word and walked over to Boar Head with a gloomy
        expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei!” Jiang Cheng hurriedly grabbed onto him and took hold of Gu
        Fei’s arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei turned around and with a face full of irritation, his eyebrows
        twisted: “What are you doing?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng said in a low voice: “Playing is playing, competing is
        competing. If they don’t want any face, then it’s their problem. But if
        we want to win, then we must win in a way that leaves no room for
        debate.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Well said Cheng-<em>ge</em>!” Wang Xu also kept his voice low and
        maintained a moved and tragic expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stared at him. After a long time, he finally opened his mouth:
        “Got it.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Looking at the scores, the second half of the game didn’t hold much
        suspense; as long as Class 8 didn’t stay rooted in place and wait for
        Class 7 to shoot, they would definitely be able to win.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Wang Xu and the rest foresaw this victory. As if each and every one of
        their bodies were lit on fire, they ran like their tails had been
        burned, dashing around with a <em>swoosh</em>. Those who did layups and
        vied for rebounds seemed to have firecrackers between their feet that
        made them as happy as a lark<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>, even letting all
        the substitutes on the bench come up in turn to practice some.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Class 8’s audience also yelled with all their hearts since the
        opportunity to cheer for their own class during a competition was really
        hard to come by. Lao Lu, on the other hand, could make himself be heard
        above all the screams even without the use of a loudspeaker.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">However, Class 7 would not concede.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        On the court of a game, there really wasn’t such a thing as conceding.
        Unless it were at the very last second, nobody would simply concede
        defeat.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        But Class 7’s method of expressing their unwillingness to concede
        actually irritated Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        All sorts of collisions, blocks, and petty maneuvers were continuously
        used in the open and in the shadows. The number of fouls committed in
        just the first few minutes of the third quarter was enough for a free
        throw to be given.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        They no longer cared about whether or not they could score any points –
        they couldn’t possibly catch up. Their only goal was probably to vent
        their anger as they interfered with Class 8’s attempts at scoring.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “I can’t stand it anymore.” Lu Xiaobin had always been a person of few
        words, but during the break, he wiped his sweat and complained, “I was
        even hit on the base of my thigh. It could’ve been my balls, you know. I
        don’t want to be impotent…”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “But we have to win cleanly.” Wang Xu had been elbowed in the head when
        he went to snatch a rebound, but he continued to adhere to Jiang Cheng’s
        words. “They can do whatever they want, but we can’t do whatever we
        want. Otherwise, if we win, people may say that we played dirty.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Then let’s bear with it for a little longer,” Guo Xu sighed. “We’ll
        definitely be able to win anyways. There’s less than ten minutes
        remaining. They don’t stand a chance no matter what they do.”
      </p>

      <p>“It’s been four times for Boar Head, right?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei sounded in response, looking over at the people on the
        other side with a face full of displeasure.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go incite him to do it again,” Jiang Cheng said. “Remember only to
        incite a foul, not commit a foul.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Gu Fei still had a face full of displeasure.</p>

      <p>
        “I’ll tell you guys what to do in this kind of situation in a little
        while.” Jiang Cheng raised his arms and stretched his waist. His arms
        continued to rise until the people from Class 7 all looked over from the
        other side, then he stretched out his thumb and turned it downward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hu Jian immediately pointed at him, spouting incoherent obscenities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng then raised his arms over his head again, formed a heart,
        and even tilted his body toward him.
      </p>

      <p>Laughter burst out from all sides.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Hu Jian cursed loudly. He was about to charge over with a swing
        of his arm but was held back by the other people in his class.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just do that?” Wang Xu was a little befuddled, “Should we do it
        together?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I meant when we go on the court again in a bit.” Jiang Cheng felt a
        little helpless and withdrew his arms, “I’m just warming up and giving a
        little thanks to those who cheered us on.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh!” Wang Xu came to a sudden realization, patted a few of the other
        teammates around him, and then turned toward the people in their class
        and raised his arms into a heart. “Quick, give our thanks to our
        cheerleading team!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Who knew whether it was because the group of them were overexcited or
        because they had acknowledged Wang Xu’s position as the class tyrant,
        but they had actually only hesitated for a split moment before they
        raised their arms together to strike a few heart shapes toward their
        classmates.
      </p>

      <p>
        The people from Class 8 suddenly burst into shouts, pulling the other
        audience members into a round of applause.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei.” Wang Xu turned to Gu Fei, who was cradling his arm and
        watching the excitement on the side.
      </p>

      <p>“No.” Gu Fei simply refused.</p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei! Don’t you have any collective sense of honour?!” Wang Xu glared
        at him, “Quickly!”
      </p>

      <p>“Mental retards.” Gu Fei continued to simply refuse.</p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei!” The girls from the class started shouting, “Gu Fei! Gu Fei!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Even Jiang Cheng, Cheng-<em>ge</em>, struck a heart!” Wang Xu cried.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do I have to strike one just because Jiang Cheng Cheng struck one?” Gu
        Fei was a little helpless.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>What the fuck is Jiang Cheng Cheng?!</em> Jiang Cheng, who was
        drinking water at the side, almost choked.
      </p>

      <p>
        The referee blew the whistle – the last few minutes of the game were
        about to start. The girls were still shouting with voices that carried
        hints of disappointment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt that Gu Fei wasn’t likely to give this honor, so he
        turned away and started walking toward the court. Suddenly, he heard a
        wave of mad screams reverberate all around him; the girls on the other
        side even started jumping as they screamed.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned his head and saw Gu Fei raising his arms above his head to
        strike a heart.
      </p>

      <p><em>…Fuck, they’ve all gone mad.</em></p>

      <p>
        Class 7 was behind almost by 20 points, and there were only a few
        minutes left so no matter what might happen, it was impossible for them
        to catch up. As a result, the moment they started playing, their tactic
        wasn’t to score points but to wear down the people from Class 8
        one-by-one.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as the ball landed in Class 8’s hands, whoever held the ball
        would instantly be surrounded by at least two players of Class 7. Boar
        Head and Hu Jian, the pair of scoundrels, were the main force. There may
        not necessarily be many small actions taken, but they would pester them
        so much that they couldn’t even pass the ball, easily making them reach
        over 24 seconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only thing Jiang Cheng could admire about Class 7 was their energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this kind of situation, only with Jiang Cheng and Gu Fei cooperating
        could they go on offense. They must move rapidly and make use of every
        second<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> to pass to one another with tricky
        angles.
      </p>

      <p>
        There had been several times when Jiang Cheng couldn’t bother to care
        about the timing of his pass to Gu Fei and only knew that he must pass
        it. At those times, he had nearly smashed Gu Fei’s head.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just when Gu Fei caught the ball and made it past the midline, Boar Head
        blocked right in front of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even when Jiang Cheng was several steps away, he could see the fire
        surging from Boar Head’s eyes – it had to be as big as a candle.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was a good chance. With Gu Fei’s skill, inciting Boar Head wasn’t a
        problem, especially since the original purpose of Boar Head being here
        was to play dirty.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Pass!” Jiang Cheng got rid of the person guarding him, rushed to the
        left front side of Gu Fei, and shouted.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei glanced at him and charged forward with the ball in both hands;
        then he changed his angle the moment Boar Head was about to slam his
        hand down on the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        Boar Head slapped his hand down on his wrist instead, making a crisp
        sound.
      </p>

      <p>The ball flew out of Gu Fei’s hands.</p>

      <p>
        Immediately after, the referee’s whistle sounded: “Hacking foul!<a
          href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >
        Five fouls!”<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>
      </p>

      <p>The audience burst into a symphony of roars and applause.</p>

      <p>
        When Boar Head was disqualified from the court as penalty, Wang Xu
        high-fived his teammates one by one with a face full of excitement as if
        he was the one who had disqualified Boar Head himself – he was simply
        high with fighting spirits.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, Boar Head getting switched out did nothing to diminish Class
        7’s shameless arrogance. There were only four minutes left in the game.
      </p>

      <p>The rampage led by Hu Jian continued.</p>

      <p>
        Frankly speaking, Class 7’s persistent attitude of desperately fighting
        back even at the last second was pretty… you know… when some teams saw
        that it was impossible to catch up, the last quarter could definitely be
        played like a walk in the park.
      </p>

      <p>But Class 7’s persistence was used the wrong way.</p>

      <p>
        During the several times that Hu Jian pounced on Jiang Cheng, he had
        wanted to slap Hu Jian on the face. He had even regretted that he didn’t
        use the handle of the mop to beat him up that noontime.
      </p>

      <p>
        An opportunity came at the last minute. Hu Jian grabbed the ball and
        charged toward the net. To be honest, Class 7’s physical capabilities
        were much more potent than that of Class 8’s. Probably because they had
        many substitutes, so they had much more time to rest.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hu Jian even had the energy to rush forward at this time. Their team’s
        speed was already a little slower than when they first started, thus
        letting Hu Jian make it directly to the net.
      </p>

      <p>He leaped up and shot the ball.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng calculated the time of his take-off and put all his strength
        into this jump; Hu Jian’s jump wasn’t anythingoutstanding – it wasn’t
        even comparable to that of a heavy player like Lu Xiaobin. Jiang Cheng’s
        jump overtook him.
      </p>

      <p>Hu Jian shot the ball, and it flew toward the net as he was rising.</p>

      <p>
        At that moment, Jiang Cheng reached out in the air and slapped down on
        the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        The slap was clean and precise. Except for the ball, nothing else was
        touched.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this slap was akin to a volleyball smash; he had used his full
        strength, and the ball shot directly downward, smashing right on Hu
        Jian’s face whose toes had just barely touched the ground and hadn’t
        even had the chance to stabilize himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hu Jian slammed backward, landing roughly with his butt on the ground
        with a thud.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Foul!” Hu Jian roared after he recovered from his shock, “He just did a
        hacking foul!”
      </p>

      <p>The referee looked at him and didn’t say a word.</p>

      <p>
        “Foul, my fucking ass.” Wang Xu rushed forward and snatched the ball
        that had landed on the ground. He then turned around and passed the ball
        to Guo Xu, who was standing at the midline.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sorry about that.” Jiang Cheng walked over and patted his shoulder,
        then also turned around and ran off.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck!” Hu Jian continued to angrily shout, “Fuck!”</p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng heard his voice, he hurriedly caught up then turned his
        head to glance at him. He found that the fellow had been struck so hard
        that he had a nosebleed and was currently glaring at him with blood
        smeared all over his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other side, Gu Fei scored another shot. The time left in the game
        was almost up, and the people from Class 8 were all screaming and
        jumping as they clapped.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 7 wanted to switch people, but were cursed by Hu Jian: “Switch, my
        fucking ass! I’m not dead yet!”
      </p>

      <p>
        With a nosebleed that flew everywhere, Hu Jian finished the last
        half-minute of the game. When the whistle signaling the end of the game
        sounded, he took the ball and slammed it onto the ground, which then
        flew toward Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        This action wasn’t in Jiang Cheng’s line of sight. When he felt the ball
        approaching, it was already too late to dodge. Just when he thought ‘<em
          >fuck, I probably really do have an injury-prone physique’</em
        >, Gu Fei reached out to block it, and slapped the ball away just as it
        was about to smash his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Wang Xu was furious. He pointed at Hu Jian, “What’s wrong with
        you? You can’t play basketball, but you sure are a professional at being
        a thug!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What does it have to do with you? Do you really think you’re the boss?”
        Hu Jian also pointed back at him, and several people from Class 7 had
        rushed over to surround him – with multiple pairs of eyes spitting fire,
        they could even start a bonfire party.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m not the boss <em>ah</em>,” Wang Xu countered, “Our boss is Gu Fei.
        What, you want to look for our boss?”
      </p>

      <p>
        The people from Class 7 didn’t say a word and collectively glared at Gu
        Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t even glance at their direction and just turned around and
        left.
      </p>

      <p>
        The people in Class 8 were so enthralled with excitement that nobody
        noticed the daggers being exchanged on the court. They all rushed up and
        surrounded the members of their team, turning into a screaming mass, and
        instantly pushed aside the people from Class 7.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Great job!” Lao Xu was caught in the crowd, trying his best to get
        closer to them, “Great job! This is exactly the kind of manner you need
        to have when playing ball! You have all finally learned to have
        self-control! Great job! I am so touch–”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng, that slap was very well covered!” Lao Lu’s voice that had
        crushed Lao Xu’s to the floor until nothing remained loudly buzzed in
        Jiang Cheng’s ear. “The skills, the techniques! All covered up that not
        even a hint of temper could be seen!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You must also go teach Class 7, otherwise how would you face them
        tomorrow?” Guo Xu joked, “So partial ah.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “They can learn from Class 4 that I brought up before. They even made a
        collective protest against taking my classes!” Lao Lu scoffed, “This
        sort of upright and honorable behavior<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> is
        precisely what I like to see! Even in fights, you must be upright and
        honorable, take a look at last year’s.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Lu Laoshi! Lao Lu! You mustn’t fight often!” Lao Xu cut him off and
        looked at the members of the basketball team, “You guys are my pride!
        You are all my pride!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng struggled to free himself from the crowd. He tugged at his
        shirt collar and shook it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m exhausted.” Gu Fei also squeezed himself out, “Class 7’s energy is
        really shocking.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “They have a lot of substitutes.” Jiang Cheng glanced at the excited
        crowd behind him, “What did Lao Lu mean about last year?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Last year, he fought with the third years,” Gu Fei explained. “It was
        extremely exciting. But then he was kicked out by the third year to
        teach our year instead.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “He really has a lot of personality <em>ah</em>.” Jiang Cheng sighed
        with some emotion.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wait for me first before you come to school in the morning for the next
        few days,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En?” Jiang Cheng glanced at him, then turned to look at Class 7. The
        people there had already dragged their chairs away in frustration,
        leaving only a few members of the basketball team standing and still
        glowering at the people on this side.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You don’t need to worry about Hu Jian and that bunch, a couple of
        students can’t cause much trouble,” Gu Fei said. “Jiang Bin is the real
        problem.”
      </p>

      <p>“Who is Jiang Bin?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“Boar Head.” Gu Fei explained, “He’s Hou Zi’s little cousin.”</p>

      <p>
        “Hou Zi?” Jiang Cheng was taken aback. Only after thinking back for a
        long time did he come to remember who Hou Zi was, but then he was
        immediately a little stupefied. “Are all the gangsters you have here
        part of a family business? How did we drag Hou Zi into this again?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Bullshit, it’s not like you’ve gone anywhere else. This area is all
        part of Hou Zi’s gang’s territory.” Gu Fei snorted.
      </p>

      <p>“Isn’t Hou Zi afraid of you?” Jiang Cheng asked in a low voice.</p>

      <p>
        “He just doesn’t want to mess with me,” Gu Fei stretched his waist.
        “Doesn’t mean he’s afraid of me.”
      </p>

      <p>“Why?” Jiang Cheng continued to question.</p>

      <p>“Because I’m not scared of dying.” Gu Fei shot him a look.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng gazed at him in silence.</p>

      <p>
        “Go, go, go!” Wang Xu rushed to their side. “Go wash your faces. We’ll
        be watching Class 2’s game later, and then have a meal together in the
        evening. Jing Yi says that we can use the class funds.”
      </p>

      <p>“Eating off of public funds?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “This is a normal expense! How did it become eating off of public
        funds?! We’ve brought glory to our class!” Wang Xu’s waist was posed
        incredibly straight, “And the entire class agrees! There are even people
        representing the class to come accompany us!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… the more you talk, the more problematic it sounds.” Jiang Cheng
        couldn’t help but laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Right? Some girls want to eat with us.” Wang Xu whispered and even
        glanced over at the girls. “I thought it would be livelier this way, so
        I agreed.”
      </p>

      <p>“Abuse of authority,”<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> Gu Fei commented.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Wang Xu started growing embarrassed, but thought for a bit then
        held his neck. “You guys can help if you two have any goals too!”
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck off,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        There was no suspense during Class 2’s game; the opponent was weak and
        didn’t have Class 7’s underhandedness – it was a one-sided battle the
        entire time.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We can’t beat them.” Jiang Cheng remarked as he observed the players
        from Class 2 from where he stood under the net.
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei sounded in agreement.</p>

      <p>
        “The levels of their abilities are too equal, and each of them is tall.”
        Jiang Cheng used his hands to cover his mouth, not wanting Wang Xu at
        the side to feel discouraged, “They must normally play basketball
        together all the time, just look at their cooperation.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Since their class lives on campus, they usually play a game when they
        have nothing better to do,” Gu Fei whispered in reply. “And it’s true
        that they’d normally get together when they play.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How is it?” Wang Xu was recording on his phone beside them, “I recorded
        some. We’ll be finished with exams when we face them, so we still have
        some time to study their weaknesses.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “Nobody in their class can be as strong as our Lu Xiaobin,” Wang Xu
        said. “They’re probably not as tacit as the two of you from what I see.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t put your voice in the recording,” Gu Fei interrupted him. “It
        would be annoying to hear when the time comes to watch it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck! You’re swelling from pride now!” Wang Xu narrowed his eyes at
        him, “But it’s understandable, I’m also swelling.”
      </p>

      <p>
        When they finished watching Class 2’s game, Jiang Cheng only felt two
        things: One was that they couldn’t beat them, and two, their
        cheerleading team was really amazing.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they prepared to leave, the captain of Class 2’s team walked over.
      </p>

      <p>
        “He’s He Zhou,” Gu Fei tilted his head over and whispered in Jiang
        Cheng’s ear, “Don’t give weird nicknames.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng sounded in response.</p>

      <p>
        When Wang Xu saw that He Zhou was coming over, he made a beeline over
        there to greet him, but He Zhou only gave him a nod and immediately
        walked past him until he stopped right in front of Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>“See you guys in the next game,” he said.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei smiled, “Will you go easy<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> on us?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “We never go easy.” He Zhou also smiled, “You guys don’t need us to go
        easy either. I’ve waited for so long, and now I finally have the chance
        to play against you.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t reply.</p>

      <p>He Zhou turned to look at Jiang Cheng: “You’re Jiang Cheng, right?”</p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng nodded, “Jiang Cheng.”</p>

      <p>
        “I’m He Zhou.” He Zhou smiled, but one could see a hint of provocation
        in his eyes, “Don’t hold back when the time comes, three-point king.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After He Zhou left, Wang Xu stared at his silhouette with some
        dissatisfaction: “That fella is just a smiling tiger.”<a href="#_ftn8"
          >[8]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        “Learn a bit of the other person’s killing intent,” Gu Fei said.
        “Captain.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck, let’s go eat! Go!” Wang Xu waved his hand, but thought of
        something and turned back to look at Jiang Cheng, “You even have the
        title of a ‘three-point king’ now? Not bad <em>ah</em>, I, a captain,
        don’t even have as much limelight as you, huh?”
      </p>

      <p>“You do.” Jiang Cheng gave him a thumbs up.</p>

      <p>
        “I do, my ass. Say it, if you’re the three-point king, then what am I?”
        Wang Xu pointed at himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The three-point king’s captain,” Gu Fei and Jiang Cheng replied
        simultaneously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu glared at the two for a while: “I think you two can win an award
        for the most tacit deskmates.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After leaving the school, Jiang Cheng immediately caught sight of Gu
        Miao, who was sitting on the railing of the parking lot. Her skateboard
        was placed vertically against the railing with a foot holding it in
        place while the other swayed.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng waved at her.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao kicked the skateboard to the ground, jumped straight from the
        railing onto the skateboard, and borrowed the inertia to slide forward.
      </p>

      <p>“Cool,” Jiang Cheng praised.</p>

      <p>“Queen Miao Miao is too cool!” Wang Xu applauded.</p>

      <p>
        A group of people started praising her, but Gu Miao didn’t acknowledge a
        single one of them and continued to circle them with a cold expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>She really is pretty cool.</em> Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Miao, who
        worked the skateboard like an extension of her body. It was just that
        when he thought of the fact that her coolness had stemmed from a
        psychological or physical problem, he would be hit by a bout of sadness.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You,” Gu Fei approached him closer and said in a hushed voice, “Quickly
        get on my bike.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What is it?” Jiang Cheng looked around but didn’t see Hou Zi or anybody
        that looked to be the same type as Hou Zi that they would need to flee
        from.
      </p>

      <p>“I don’t want to go with any girls,” Gu Fei explained.</p>

      <p>“Oh.” Jiang Cheng understood and nodded his head.</p>

      <p>
        Following that, he watched as Gu Fei took the lead and, without even
        caring for his sister, rushed into the bicycle shed, grabbed his bike,
        and pedaled forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Catch up, Gu Miao!” Jiang Cheng shouted, then ran for a few steps after
        Gu Fei’s bike.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei also didn’t know how he had become so afraid of the girls in his
        class, the speed he pedaled at was simply beyond what was humanly
        possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck! Why don’t you just fly?!” Jiang Cheng had to grab onto his
        clothes to slow down the bike before he could finally get on.
      </p>

      <p>“We’ll fly after you come up,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had just sat down with some stability when he saw a shadow
        zoom past him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao had already started flying first. Looking at that speed, Jiang
        Cheng momentarily wondered if him sitting at the back of Gu Fei’s bike
        had delayed his takeoff.
      </p>

      <p>
        They flew behind Gu Miao for half a mile. Jiang Cheng heard his phone
        ringing, so he took it out and saw that it was Wang Xu.
      </p>

      <p>“Hello?” He answered the phone.</p>

      <p>
        “Those who don’t know would think that you two were fleeing to find a
        bathroom!” From the sound of it, Wang Xu was pedaling as he yelled,
        “Going so fast, do you guys even know where we’re eating?!”
      </p>

      <p>“Where are we eating?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Downtown <em>ah</em>! There’s a shabu-shabu<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a>
        place at the square! Da Fei knows it,” Wang Xu replied. “What good place
        can there be to eat in our area! You know that the only thing you can
        eat in this area is Wang Er’s Flatbread!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fine, I got it.” Jiang Cheng laughed. He hung up the phone and patted
        the back of Gu Fei’s shoulder, “Hey, Mr. Pilot.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Where to?” Gu Fei turned his head to ask. He then blew a whistle,
        signaling Gu Miao, who was immersed in the rush, to stop.
      </p>

      <p>
        “He said it was a shabu-shabu place downtown,” Jiang Cheng answered.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It must have been reserved by Captain Wang. He loves that place.” Gu
        Fei made a turn at an intersection.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao edged closer to them, bent her waist, then reached a hand out
        and placed it under Jiang Cheng’s butt.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah!” Jiang Cheng was shocked. He quickly stabilized himself, and then
        he grabbed at Gu Fei’s waist. “What are you doing?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao calmly grabbed the rack at the back of the bike then glanced at
        him before staring at the road ahead with a serene expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your brother is dragging two people. He must be exhausted.” Jiang Cheng
        remarked with a laugh.
      </p>

      <p>“There’s no weight on her if she does this,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Just switch with me when you get tired later,” Jiang Cheng suggested.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I always thought that you didn’t know how to ride a bike.” Gu Fei
        leaned his head back.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I just don’t have a bike,” Jiang Cheng replied. He thought for a while
        and sighed again, “I’m also too lazy to buy one.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Pretty incredible, too lazy to buy a bike but isn’t too lazy to walk
        every day.” Gu Fei snickered, “I’ll take you someday. There’s a place
        near where we bought the yarn last time.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay,” Jiang Cheng sounded in agreement.</p>

      <p>
        The two people didn’t speak anymore after that. Jiang Cheng stared at Gu
        Fei’s back, and Gu Miao was swishing beside him. This feeling was pretty
        comfortable, adding to that was the leftover excitement and exhaustion
        from the game as well as the momentary trance that came with the
        tranquility of being isolated from their surroundings.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Jiang Cheng had a nagging feeling that there was something off about
        his posture. It took him a long time before it suddenly hit him that his
        hand was still resting on Gu Fei’s waist.
      </p>

      <p>
        This discovery gave him a considerable shock, yet it didn’t make him
        retract his hand as if he was electrocuted. He didn’t want to be so
        unreasonable about every little thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was just that the palm that initially hadn’t felt anything before –
        now that he realized this fact – kept feeling like it could sense Gu
        Fei’s body temperature even when separated by clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>I must be possessed.</em> Jiang Cheng closed his eyes and sighed yet
        again.
      </p>

      <p><em>***</em></p>

      <p>The translators have something to say:</p>

      <p>Sae: I love them |･д･)ﾉ</p>

      <p>
        Ice: I am a homebody, a proud couch potato, so I know nothing about
        sports… the most I know literally comes from my high school PE classes.
        I literally bullshitted my way through all the basketball terminology
        hoping that they’d somehow sound somewhat accurate. (￣ー￣；)
      </p>

      <p>
        Ahahaha… I like that last bicycle scene so much… there’s just something
        so romantic about it… and it sounded really good in the audio drama
        (then again, the entire drama sounded good).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        Before the classes were divided in the First Year, Gu Fei was still in
        Class 1. At that time, there was a dolt in their class who was chatting
        in the back row with the girl he had just gotten with, probably also
        even brushing their elbows together occasionally, during the self-study
        period. Then after the self-study period was over, the guy would go
        straight to the bathroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was said that this hot-blooded young man had ejaculated simply from
        just brushing elbows and would go to the bathroom to dispose of his
        underwear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Their class had laughed and couldn’t get over this for over an entire
        semester.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei had thought it was very amusing at the time, but now he felt like
        they were pretty similar to one another.
      </p>

      <p>
        He lowered his eyes to glance at the left side of his body, Jiang
        Cheng’s left hand was still resting on his waist. At first, he had only
        grabbed onto him because Gu Miao had given him a scare, but probably
        because Gu Miao had continued to hold on to the bicycle seat, he didn’t
        have anywhere else to place his hands… so half-holding, half-grasping,
        his hand never withdrew from his waist.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Gu Fei, this sort of “if you don’t look with your eyes, you would
        hardly feel it” kind of contact was something he wouldn’t be able to
        feel at all under normal circumstances. He had carried plenty of people
        on the backseat of his bike or motorcycle before, men and women alike,
        so this sort of contact was beyond normal.
      </p>

      <p>But the person now was Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        When he looked at Jiang Cheng now, the vague or distinct recollections
        of Jiang Cheng’s body in Ding Zhuxin’s demented and tattered designs
        would sometimes emerge in his mind uncontrollably.
      </p>

      <p>
        His legs, his waist, his back, and even the scar on his ribs and cracked
        lips…
      </p>

      <p>
        In summary, the hand that Jiang Cheng rested on his waist now, was like
        a grenade.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        If it exploded, maybe a pair of his underwear would also need to be
        disposed of.
      </p>

      <p>
        After pedaling for a while, he caught sight of the group from their
        basketball team as well as the girls they brought on the backs of their
        bikes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stretched out his right hand with his palm facing the back and
        squeezed the brakes. As soon as the bike slowed down, Gu Miao’s face
        just happened to hit his palm. She kept her face against his hand as a
        stop and used the momentum to slow down the speed of her skateboard.
      </p>

      <p>“What is it?” Jiang Cheng asked from behind.</p>

      <p>
        “You take over <em>ba</em>.”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> Gu Fei used his leg
        to prop up the bike and looked back at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re tired already?” Jiang Cheng got off the bike, “This physical
        strength of yours is saddening. You can’t even pedal a bike after a
        single game.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why didn’t I realize before just how talkative you are?” Gu Fei also
        got off and shoved the handlebar of the bike over to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ve never cooperated with Er Miao before,” Jiang Cheng swung himself
        onto the seat. “I won’t bump into her, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you happen to bump into her, she knows how to move away.” Gu Fei sat
        on the backseat, “Let’s go.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s so hard to start pedaling on the spot, can’t you wait for me to…”
        Jiang Cheng started.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No. My physical strength that isn’t even enough to pedal a bike after a
        single game won’t allow me to run anymore.” Gu Fei retorted as he took
        out his phone and started playing on it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Jiang Cheng quietly cursed but could only exert his strength to
        start the bike right on the spot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao took the initiative to distance herself two steps away and
        started her skateboard with a kick. Then after a while, she slid back
        and grabbed onto the backseat to let herself be dragged forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng pedaled for a period of time and caught up to Wang Xu and
        the rest in front of them.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re here,” Guo Xu turned around and saw them. “You guys ran off
        pretty fast ah.”
      </p>

      <p>“We’re hungry,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng.” A girl on the left called out to him.</p>

      <p>
        He turned his head and the phone in the girl’s hand made a
        <em>kacha</em> sound. He sighed: “Don’t you know to turn off the sound
        when you’re sneaking a picture?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “This isn’t sneaking a picture <em>ah</em>.” The girl covered her mouth
        a little embarrassed and giggled for a long while.
      </p>

      <p>
        The group of them chatted as they rode along the way. It wasn’t a short
        distance from where they were to downtown; they had noisily occupied an
        entire lane, and whenever a motorcycle or moped had to get by, they
        would squeeze together into a clump and giggle foolishly.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >It’s really that age where they would laugh even if they’re eating
          shit.</em
        >
        Jiang Cheng looked at the people around him.
      </p>

      <p>
        These people, if it was before he moved, would have basically been the
        topic of ridicule for him and Pan Zhi. They were a little crude, kind of
        stupid, yet he was now squeezed together at the side of a road with
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        But he didn’t giggle with them… however, he had already lost count of
        the number of times he and Gu Fei had giggled together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stayed silent the entire time, donning the unsociable look he
        always had and played on his phone with his head lowered behind him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whenever the girls wanted to sneak a picture of him, Gu Fei would
        directly bury his head in his back.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Stop taking pictures, just ask which of these two do you want pictures
        of.” Wang Xu had Yi Jing on his bike, he looked full of energy with no
        shortness of breath, “I have them all. There are even pictures of Jiang
        Cheng eating flatbreads.”
      </p>

      <p>“You motherfucker.” Jiang Cheng glared at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Send it over, I want to see it!” Immediately, one of the girls started
        to shout.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I can’t just send it that easily, and I can’t beat Jiang Cheng.” Wang
        Xu said, “I can only sell them, one is 20 yuan.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You are willing to take a beating for 20 yuan…” Lu Xiaobin muttered.
      </p>

      <p>Everybody instantly burst into laughter.</p>

      <p>
        “You shut the hell up!” Wang Xu glared at him, “Do you even know how to
        calculate?! If ten people buy them, then that’s 200 yuan!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “True,” Lu Xiaobin paused. “That’s a lot then. Jiang Cheng now has a lot
        of fans, if everyone bought one… you’ll earn quite a bit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The IQ of you people ah,” Guo Xu sighed. “A photo can be sold once at
        most. Once it’s sold to one person, they can just make copies, who would
        want to continue buying from you…”
      </p>

      <p>“Scram!” Wang Xu shouted, “Only your IQ is high right?!”</p>

      <p>
        “That’s a pretty good business idea,” Gu Fei whispered from behind. “I
        have all different ones in my hands, high resolutions, with your face
        included, and no pixelati…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you even have any ethics left in you as a professional
        photographer?” Jiang Cheng whipped his head around and whispered back.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Of course I do, that’s why I haven’t sold them yet.” Gu Fei replied,
        “I’m waiting for a high price…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you believe me when I say that I will throw you off?” Jiang Cheng
        threatened.
      </p>

      <p>“Nope,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng opened his mouth but couldn’t let out a word.</p>

      <p>
        “There’s a level I can’t pass.” Gu Fei brought the phone next to his
        face, “Can you help me pass it later?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… Fuck.” Jiang Cheng was speechless. “Are you still competing with Li
        Yan?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei continued to play, “He’s already three levels ahead of me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll help you pass three levels later,” Jiang Cheng said. “You’re
        playing this stupid game like it’s some serious business. It’s as if
        we’re still waiting for you to save the world <em>ne</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei started laughing from behind him: “That’s right <em>ah</em>, and
        the ones that I’ll eliminate first are those with a nasty mouth.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Since Wang Xu had only called to reserve a room right before they left,
        there weren’t any bigger rooms left. With the players and the girls
        added together, it was around twenty people, so in the end, the waiters
        had to put three tables into a single room.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just squeeze together,” a waiter said. “Young people, right, you bond
        more when squeezed together.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright! Let’s squeeze together!” Wang Xu nodded then pushed them into
        the room one by one.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng pulled Gu Miao to the innermost seat by the wall. He had
        promised Gu Miao that they would sit together. Gu Fei then followed
        after and squeezed in with them, plopping down right beside him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re not sitting beside Gu Miao?” Jiang Cheng glanced around: to the
        left was Gu Fei and to the right was Gu Miao.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s too late to switch.” Gu Fei had stood up, but just as he wanted to
        switch seats, he saw that everybody had already squeezed in, so he
        immediately sat back down and lowered his voice. “If I switch now, I’d
        probably end up with girls on either side.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What,” Jiang Cheng kind of wanted to laugh. “Do you have some sort of
        problem?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t have a problem,” Gu Fei retorted. Yi Jing sat down on his other
        side; without making a sound, he lightly inched his chair closer to
        Jiang Cheng’s side. He leaned over and whispered, “I’m just not used to
        it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “A dignified boss like you…” Jiang Cheng poured a cup of tea and set it
        in front of Gu Miao. “Gu Miao, drink some water and take off your
        jacket, your face is flushed right now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The room was small, and when the group of people squeezed in and sat
        around a long table, it looked like a meeting, both hot and noisy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao took a sip of water. She then raised her hand and tossed her hat
        on the table, donning a head of messy hair that stuck out everywhere as
        she took off her coat and tossed it on the floor next to her.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hang it on that rack,” Gu Fei said, pointing at the coat rack in the
        corner. He then took off his own jacket and handed it over to her, “Help
        <em>Gege</em> hang his too.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao grabbed the clothes and hat and hung them up, her hair still in
        a wild mess.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Smooth out your hair,” Jiang Cheng said. “You’re a little lady, you
        have to watch your image.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao stared at him and impatiently combed through her head a few
        times before her gaze then shifted to his jacket.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng quickly took off his jacket and handed it to her,
        “Hang it up for Cheng-<em>ge</em> too, thank you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao took his jacket over with a serious expression on her face, and
        since she wasn’t tall enough to reach any higher, she placed his jacket
        on top of Gu Fei’s on a single hook. Then she went to sit back down and
        picked up her cup to slowly drink her tea as she huddled in her chair.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng leaned back in his chair so that the backrest hit the wall.
        He hugged his arms as he watched the room full of people who all just
        had to yell at the top of their lungs if they wanted to speak – it was
        very noisy, very chaotic. The door to the room was originally open, but
        because the waiters couldn’t stand it anymore, they came by and shut the
        door.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was also very jovial. He hadn’t attended a gathering like this in
        a long time. In his previous school, everybody was a studying maniac
        with very strict families, thus most of them went straight home right
        after school ended.
      </p>

      <p>
        Someone who would skip a class when he was bored and stayed out all
        night like him wouldn’t even have a companion most of the time…
      </p>

      <p>
        The rowdiness in front of him now made him finally feel the warmth that
        spring should have.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What do we eat, what do we eat?!” Wang Xu took the menu and started
        attending to everyone, “I ordered three pots, all of them are
        two-flavored, is that enough?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Enough, enough!” Somebody shouted in reply, “The type of pot doesn’t
        matter. What’s important is the meat! The vegetables!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s plenty for meat and vegetables.” Yi Jing smiled as he patted
        his backpack, “We’ve already brought the class funds, and Xu Zhong has
        also said that he’ll make up for it if we overspend.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Lao Xu is quite interesting sometimes,” Wang Xu remarked. “He just nags
        too much, even more so than my mom. He would always end up moving
        himself first whenever he says something… Lamb! Fatty Beef! Pork belly!
        Hurry! If anybody has something else they want to eat, I’ll write it
        down!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The heat is making me sleepy.” Gu Fei also leaned back with his seat.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the members of the basketball team that took off his jacket had on
        short-sleeves underneath, so when Gu Fei leaned closer, his arm would
        brush lightly against his.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a season that wasn’t yet suitable to wear short-sleeves, the sudden
        skin contact made Jiang Cheng suddenly feel a rather peculiar feeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei probably felt the same. Jiang Cheng could sense him immediately
        making some space between them by shifting toward Yi Jing, but barely
        two seconds later, he had scooched back over again.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng contemplated this and felt that it was pretty funny,
        chuckling at the teacup in front of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Gu Fei also started laughing along with him. He might as well
        let loose, and relaxedly lean against him, even letting his legs rest
        against Jiang Cheng’s. “Laugh again and I will exterminate you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “With just a rubber band, I can kill you right back…” Jiang Cheng
        smiled. He glanced at his and Gu Fei’s legs pressing against each other
        under the table and suddenly realized that his level of acceptance
        toward Gu Fei’s touch was already just as much as that of his grandson,
        Pan Zhi.
      </p>

      <p>Moreover, this feeling was completely different than with Pan Zhi.</p>

      <p>
        … Of course, it was completely different. Pan Zhi was a good brother, a
        brother who he could share secrets and freely play rough with. Gu Fei on
        the other hand… Gu Fei was someone of his kind who, to him, incited an
        intuitive attraction and exuded a sense of temptation.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite never having considered the idea of finding someone of the same
        kind, let alone seeking comfort in one another, he had to admit that as
        they were <em>now</em>, with what was before them <em>now</em>, in a
        crowd of rowdy people and an atmosphere that was a little too warm, in
        the minuscule details unnoticed by anyone else, and in the fleeting
        sense of ambiguity that wasn’t for others to know and only for their
        eyes to see… he felt a sense of comfort that he wanted to quietly revel
        in.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What do you want to drink Da Fei, something white?”<a href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >
        Wang Xu waved the menu in front of the two of them.
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei sounded in response.</p>

      <p>
        “What about Jiang Cheng?” Wang Xu looked over at Jiang Cheng, “We
        haven’t drunk together before, what do you want to drink?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… Whatever.” Jiang Cheng wanted to say that he didn’t want to drink
        anything at first but seeing everyone in the room in such high spirits,
        it just wasn’t good enough that they had won the game. With several
        girls also present, if he had said that he didn’t want to drink, they
        would definitely tease him to death that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wow…” Wang Xu teased. “Whatever? This tone, as expected of the
        three-point king.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “And you just said that Lao Xu was naggy,” Jiang Cheng glanced at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Watch yourself when speaking to the captain.” Wang Xu pointed at him,
        “When school had just started, I only let you off<a href="#_ftn4"
          >[4]</a
        >
        to give Da Fei face.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh.” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “Waiter—” Wang Xu flung opened the door and rushed outside, shouting,
        “Hurry up! Bring another Niu Er!<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> And some fresh
        juice—”
      </p>

      <p>
        Then he turned around to look at Gu Miao: “Queen Miao Miao, do you want
        to drink juice? There’s orange juice and corn juice.”<a href="#_ftn6"
          >[6]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao didn’t raise her head, just grasped her teacup, and shook her
        head.
      </p>

      <p>“Then what is she going to drink?” Wang Xu looked over at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>“Beer,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        “… Fuck me.” Wang Xu was struck dumb but still turned his head, “Get
        another beer, our Queen wants to drink!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Aiyo</em>, stop yelling!” The waiter stood by the door and said,
        “We’re right in front of you, what are you yelling for…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your big brother is happy today—” Wang Xu continued to yell, “Hurry,
        bring the meat and alcohol up first!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Got it already! Meat! Alcohol!” The waiter placed the bowls in front of
        him, then turned and jogged away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yi Jing stood up and took out a camera from her backpack then raised it
        toward the girl beside Wang Xu: “Juan Er, let’s take a group photo
        first. You take it from your side, and we’ll take it from our side
        afterward.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright.” The girl caught the camera she tossed over and said as she
        backed up, “Everybody squeeze toward the middle, otherwise, we can’t
        catch everybody.”
      </p>

      <p>
        A room full of people immediately squeezed toward Gu Fei and Jiang
        Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Squeeze together! Squeeze together!” Wang Xu squeezed beside Yi Jing
        and rested a hand on the wall as he leaned his body this way.
      </p>

      <p>Yi Jing smiled as she dodged him by shifting toward Gu Fei</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t say anything, swiftly leaning toward Jiang Cheng even
        closer.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Jiang Cheng had just gathered Gu Miao over to him when the
        people squeezing on his right pressed him into a bundle with Gu Fei,
        “You should all go lose weight!”
      </p>

      <p>“Quickly,” Gu Fei said to the girl taking the picture.</p>

      <p>“Smile!” The girl instructed, “Class 8 is number one!”</p>

      <p>“Class 8 is number one!” The group roared in unity.</p>

      <p>
        The girl pressed the shutter. Everybody had just started to scatter when
        she hurriedly waved her hands: “Wait! I haven’t taken one yet…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Call a waiter!” Wang Xu pointed at the door, “Call a waiter over to
        take a picture for us!”
      </p>

      <p>
        The waiter was startled by the mass they squeezed into as soon as he
        came in: “It didn’t seem like there were so many of you a moment ago…”
      </p>

      <p>“Hurry up!” Jiang Cheng couldn’t help but give a yell.</p>

      <p>
        His and Gu Fei’s chairs weren’t completely next to each other, but now
        they were squeezed so much that the two of them had to bend their
        waists. He had no choice but to place his hand on Gu Fei’s leg… this
        posture couldn’t last very long.
      </p>

      <p>“Make a heart! Make a heart!” Wang Xu suddenly ordered.</p>

      <p>
        “Make two fucking eggs-yolks, my ass!” Jiang Cheng was about to go
        crazy, “I only have one hand!”
      </p>

      <p>“I also only have one hand, not gonna happen,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “The two of you use one hand each then, hurry!” Wang Xu urged, “How
        about everybody uses one hand each! Find someone beside you to form a
        heart with and use both hands if there’s no one beside you! We made big
        hearts during the game earlier, so now let’s make small hearts! Clasp a
        finger too! Yi Jing… come on, the two of us can make one!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ai…” Yi Jing helplessly smiled and pressed her thumb and index finger
        against his to form a small heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Queen Miao Miao, you use two hands. Do you know how to make a heart?”
        Wang Xu was busying himself to death.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao held the cup of tea and leaned against Jiang Cheng as if she
        didn’t hear a word he had just said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “She doesn’t know,” Gu Fei answered for Gu Miao. He then stretched out
        his left hand in front of Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at him, then placed his right thumb and index finger
        against his.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is everybody all good?” The waiter asked, “I still have to serve the
        dishes <em>ne</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>“All good!” Everybody shouted.</p>

      <p>“One, two…” The waiter raised the camera.</p>

      <p>“Class 8 is awesome—” Wang Xu yelled.</p>

      <p>“Class 8 is awesome—” Everybody shouted in a chaotic mess.</p>

      <p>
        After the picture was taken, Jiang Cheng shook out his clothes that had
        become wrinkled from being squished and felt that he had already started
        sweating on his back.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei rubbed his legs.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looked at him: “Aw, aren’t you so fragile~.”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei couldn’t help but laugh after rubbing two more times, “Aw, your
        mouth is so nasty~.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Aw, I heard that you wanted to exterminate me~?” Jiang Cheng countered.
      </p>

      <p>
        They had just finished speaking when they both burst into a laughing fit
        under the table.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Come on, come on, come on!” Wang Xu interrupted their laughs with a
        shout, “The alcohol is here! Pour it! Pour it all! Girls, you can pour
        yourselves some juice… Miao Miao, your beer!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu placed a pint of beer in front of Gu Miao. Gu Miao stood up
        without a word, picked up the beer, and took a big gulp.
      </p>

      <p>“The fuck…” Wang Xu was given a scare, “Is she just thirsty?”</p>

      <p>
        “Can a little kid drink like this?” Yi Jing asked in a low voice beside
        them out of concern.
      </p>

      <p>“She’d drink around a cup before stopping on her own,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“What a carefree little girl,” Yi Jing lamented.</p>

      <p>
        “Come on!” After everyone had poured themselves a cup of alcohol, Wang
        Xu raised his cup, “I want to say a few words! Thanks to everyone for
        all your hard work, it’s because of that that we were able to achieve
        today’s victory!”
      </p>

      <p>“Ah—” Everyone knocked their cups together.</p>

      <p>
        “Thanks to our class representative for cheering us on and fighting to
        get us public funds for this meal!” Wang Xu said, “Thanks to Gu Fei for
        participating in the game and for playing so damn awesomely! Thank you,
        Jiang Cheng! Even though you just transferred over this semester, if we
        didn’t have you to guide us in this game, we would have never won so
        easily…”
      </p>

      <p>“Hurry and drink.” Gu Fei knocked his cup against the table.</p>

      <p>
        “Cheers!” Wang Xu knocked his glass, raised his head, and gulped down
        the alcohol.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following that, several guys leaned their heads back and downed their
        cups with one gulp.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Jiang Cheng uttered. Even though the cup wasn’t big, it wasn’t
        the extremely small type either, “Do you all chug down like this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You don’t have to.” Gu Fei also directly downed a cup, “Only Wang Xu
        and the others drink this way, you southerners…”
      </p>

      <p>“… I’m not a southerner,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “If it’s South from us here,” Gu Fei drew a line with his hand. “Then
        all are…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng!” Wang Xu raised the bottle and looked at him, “You claim
        to be fine with drinking whatever, how come you still haven’t moved?”
      </p>

      <p>
        An entire table of people all looked over, making Jiang Cheng feel
        incredibly helpless. He could only raise a toast to Wang Xu and said in
        a very low voice: “Here’s to you who has no brains…”
      </p>

      <p>
        And then he directly poured the entire cup of alcohol into his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        After downing the alcohol, the boys that were already excited grew even
        more exuberant. The sounds of their voices even started to quiver. The
        waiter pushed open the door to check on the situation: “Oh, sorry, we
        thought you had started fighting…”
      </p>

      <p>“Eat!” Wang Xu waved his chopsticks.</p>

      <p>
        The way this group of excited people devoured the shabu-shabu meat was
        not a pretty sight. They practically dumped entire plates of meat into
        the pots then immediately after, seven or eight pairs of chopsticks
        reached in and stirred around… all the meat would be completely picked
        out in less than a few seconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yi Jing picked out a plate of meat and placed it in front of Gu Miao:
        “Meimei<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a>, eat more.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao buried her head into the bowl and ate, not forgetting to stand
        up and give her a bow first.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng scooped a bowl of soup. But before he had a chance to put it
        down, Gu Miao reached out her hand, so he set it down in front of her
        and used Gu Miao’s bowl to fill himself another bowl of soup.
      </p>

      <p>
        He just sat down and didn’t even get to take a sip when Gu Fei pushed
        his own bowl toward him: “Excuse me, if you could…”
      </p>

      <p>“Get it yourself.” Jiang Cheng ignored him.</p>

      <p>“I’ll help you,” Yi Jing said.</p>

      <p>
        “No need.” Gu Fei quickly picked up the bowl and stood up, rushing to
        fill himself another bowl.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he sat down, Jiang Cheng leaned back in his chair, silently
        cackling to himself as he gazed under the table.
      </p>

      <p>“Drank too much?” Gu Fei gave him a sideways glance.</p>

      <p>
        “Ah, I did drink a little too much.” Jiang Cheng took a deep breath,
        holding back his laughs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Though that cup of alcohol really was strong, if they were to compare
        the intensity of their drinking abilities, he was more than willing to
        admit defeat to the group of people before him now. Wang Xu and the
        others were engrossed in drinking with full steam ahead; now that Lao Xu
        wasn’t here to hold back the reins, they drank like they were trying to
        use drinking as a means to prove that they were grown men… each downing
        the cups, phenomenally, unlike the common person.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng doesn’t have that ability. With just that one cup, he
        already felt like his stomach was lit on fire. Adding to the heat in the
        room, he felt like he was on the verge of passing out.
      </p>

      <p>“Ai.” Gu Fei nudged him with his arm.</p>

      <p>
        “En?” He leaned his head against the wall and tilted his head to look at
        Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei pressed a piece of candy into his palm: “Mint candy, it’ll
        gradually make things better.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at him. His mind was a little blank at that moment…
        since when was his alcohol tolerance so low?
      </p>

      <p>
        He grabbed onto Gu Fei’s hand and firmly clasped down with the piece of
        candy wedged between the two of their hands.
      </p>

      <p><em>***</em></p>

      <p>The author wants to say: Will continue tomorrow.</p>

      <p>【The author is in a bad mood, currently blank】</p>

      <p>
        “I… I’m here to kick up a fuss o(≧口≦)o!” The black furry spirit
        frantically shook its fur and yelled.
      </p>

      <p>“w(゜Д゜)w Ying.” The small black furry spirit cries.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had quite a firm grip, especially in a state where he was
        feverish to the point of losing control from the alcohol and the lively
        atmosphere. The joints in Gu Fei’s hand were in extreme pain from being
        squeezed together, and it didn’t help that the mint candy in his palm
        was also pressing into his flesh like a pebble.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei glanced at Yi Jing out of the corner of his eye; Yi Jing was
        currently being dragged into a conversation by Wang Xu, and the room
        full of people were eating, drinking, and chatting in full swing… nobody
        noticed that on this side, Jiang Cheng seemingly intended to crush his
        hand to pieces.
      </p>

      <p>“What’s wrong?” Gu Fei asked in a low voice.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t respond. He continued to only gaze at him with his
        head pillowed against the wall, still keeping a tight grasp on his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        After maintaining eye contact for a while, Gu Fei turned his face away
        and stared in a daze at the table full of dishes before him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wasn’t left-handed; he needed his right hand to eat, but Jiang Cheng
        currently had no desire to loosen his hand. All he could do was stare at
        the food on the table in silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        To be honest, he was able to sense that Jiang Cheng had already started
        to lose his inhibitions in the beginning but was able to snap back to
        his senses three to five seconds later at most.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hand that maintained such a death grip now, without an inkling of
        letting loose, brought awkwardness and a sense of loss. However, there
        was also the thought of not letting go so suddenly for fear that it may
        appear all too deliberate. For someone like Jiang Cheng, who was both
        pensive and sensitive, when confronted with a situation like this, the
        water-stricken gullies in his mind would have soon flattened out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei used his left hand to pick up the soup bowl and took a sip; this
        was a mutton tripe soup that Wang Xu especially ordered – the taste
        wasn’t bad.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This soup isn’t too bad,” Gu Fei turned around and said to Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah.” Jiang Cheng made a sound, his hand showing signs of loosening.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Want a taste?” Gu Fei asked and lightly tapped the back of Jiang
        Cheng’s hand with his thumb.
      </p>

      <p>“Is it mutton tripe?” Jiang Cheng asked, finally letting go.</p>

      <p>
        “Yes.” Gu Fei withdrew his hand and hesitated for a moment then pressed
        the mint candy that was still in his hand into Jiang Cheng’s hand once
        more.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I actually don’t like mutton tripe soup,” Jiang Cheng whispered. He
        didn’t grab his hand this time, and instead, accepted the candy and
        slowly peeled the packaging open under the table. “I like mutton soup,
        mutton bone soup, femur soup, pork belly soup…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re making me hungry.” Gu Fei used his chopsticks to pick up a piece
        of mutton tripe and put it in his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Me too.” Jiang Cheng tossed the candy into his mouth, and it in for two
        seconds before he then whipped his head around. “Is this one of those
        fucking flavor-changing candy?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No, do you like that one? That was a prank candy that Liu Fan’s friend
        brought back from Japan. I still have a whole bag of them at my place,”
        Gu Fei said with a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Give me some, just two or three pieces is enough,” Jiang Cheng said and
        nodded. Those candies were very much consistent with the way he and that
        mentally retarded Pan Zhi could get when they were together.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll give it to you on Monday,” Gu Fei said. “<em>Ai</em>, we have to
        read our self-reflection papers on Monday.”
      </p>

      <p>“… I’ve finished writing them,” Jiang Cheng sighed.</p>

      <p>
        When a large group of people eats together, especially if they were
        young adults, everyone would usually end up being full within twenty
        minutes because they had all contended to shove food in their mouths as
        if they had been trapped in a vegetable garden without a sign of meat
        for eight to ten years.
      </p>

      <p>
        And now that they were completely full, the time to slowly drink and
        boast started.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t join the ranks of people chatting and just sat by the
        side and listened.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was about the same as the gatherings he went with his classmates in
        the past, which had also included a segment for bragging. However,
        theirs was incomparable to the ones that Class 8 brought up before him
        now. As he listened to them blow to their own trumpets, Jiang Cheng kept
        on wanting to laugh; on the contrary, the few girls present appeared to
        be absorbed in the scene, seemingly giving them a lot of face.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng!” Wang Xu, at some point, had finished singing his own
        praises. He suddenly stood up and raised the cup in his hand towards
        Jiang Cheng, “Drink a shot with <em>Ge</em>!”
      </p>

      <p>“Ah?” Jiang Cheng was dumbfounded.</p>

      <p>
        “I’m making a toast to you.” Wang Xu had already drunk a lot, and his
        entire face was currently so red it glowed, “A toast to our secret
        weapon!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ve long stopped being a secret…” Jiang Cheng looked at Wang Xu’s
        stern expression, which clearly declared, ‘If you don’t drink, then I
        promise to pour it all down your throat,’ so he picked up his own cup
        and also stood up. “We’re all one team here. Let’s not be so serious,
        alright?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You aren’t as good at drinking as you are in basketball!” Wang Xu
        pointed at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was speechless. He knocked his glass against Wang Xu’s and
        threw back his head, downing the alcohol.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Now, you’re a good sport!” Wang Xu cheerfully shouted and also drank
        his alcohol all at once, “Love you!”
      </p>

      <p>“… I don’t need your love,” Jiang Cheng sat down, feeling helpless.</p>

      <p>
        “I still must love you!” Wang Xu swung his cup very charismatically, “If
        you ever run into any problems, Xu-<em>ge</em> willprotect…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sit down.” Gu Fei shoved aside Wang Xu’s arm that had been hovering
        over his head and wiped away the foam that landed on him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei!” Wang Xu acted as if he had just discovered the New World as he
        poured more beer into his cup and shouted, “Let’s…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t wait for him to finish what he had to say, nor did he wait
        for him to finish drinking. He stood up, grabbed his cup, and gulped
        down the entire content before he caught his arm. “Sit down and eat
        something.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh!” Wang Xu stared at him with an excited yet confused expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t let him drink anymore.” Gu Fei turned to look at Yi Jing, who had
        been trying to stay out of their way, “Otherwise, how are we going to
        bring him back if he passes out?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Yi Jing gave a weak smile: “He doesn’t listen to me either
        <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>“He listens,” Gu Fei responded.</p>

      <p>“Listen!” Wang Xu immediately nodded his head, “I listen!”</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei ignored him and squeezed out from Jiang Cheng’s side of the
        table.
      </p>

      <p>“Where are you going?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Wash my face,” Gu Fei replied, “And get some fruit for Er Miao to eat
        along the way.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng glanced at Gu Miao who had fallen asleep on the chair
        beside him, “She’s been asleep for a whilenow…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “She always falls asleep when it’s her bedtime.” Gu Fei put on his
        jacket and squeezed his way out of the crowd with a lot of effort.
      </p>

      <p>
        The inside of the room continued to be filled with clamor, from laughing
        to shouting to eating… the beer bottles were basically all empty. Yi
        Jing tried her hardest to prevent them from ordering more beer.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng remained in his previous posture of leaning against the
        wall. He held his arms as he gazed at the mass of people laughing with
        red faces. The atmosphere didn’t change but looking at Gu Fei’s back as
        he opened the door and walked out, he suddenly felt a little colder.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was probably because he had been squeezed beside Gu Fei the entire
        time before this, with their arms next to each other and legs touching…
        oh, he had also grabbed his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        He felt that his behavior that day was absolutely unbelievable. Even as
        he recalled the scene in which he grabbed Gu Fei’s hand, he actually
        didn’t sink deeply into embarrassment and had even felt an inexplicable
        sense of triumph – immensely pleased with himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        What the hell was he so proud of <em>ne</em>? He didn’t know – the
        thought process of a youth’s mind was precisely this obscure, and just
        as suddenly shameless!
      </p>

      <p>
        It was probably because of the alcohol. His alcohol tolerance wasn’t
        particularly low – he just couldn’t adapt to this hardcore style of
        drinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every time he finished downing the hard liquor, he would feel a sense of
        bliss as if he was stepping on clouds or had taken the wrong medicine.
        The last time he drank, he had kissed the person on the cheek, now he
        had grabbed that person’s hand and refused to let go. This was
        practically someone using his own drunkenness to act shamelessly.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the shock and awkwardness he felt toward himself for his behavior
        didn’t last long this time. For instance, when he thought back on what
        had happened now… he only wanted to laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        How scary, the fact that a person could so quickly and easily train
        their skin to grow so thick.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei had already left the room for a long time without returning.
        Jiang Cheng had to get up whether he liked it or not now… he had to use
        the bathroom. He had wanted to go for a while now but thought that it
        was a bit unfitting if he followed after to urinate just right after Gu
        Fei went to wash his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        But now, unable to no longer hold it in, he stood up and also squeezed
        his way out of the room.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng!” As soon as he managed to get to the door, Guo Xu roared
        at the top of his lung by his ear. “Where are you going?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was already a bit dizzy at first, now that he was given a
        shock, he almost rammed his head against the door. He turned around only
        to see Guo Xu’s bright red nose and the excitement sparkling in his
        eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “To the bathroom.” He patted Guo Xu on the arm, then opened the door and
        walked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hurry up! The two of us haven’t had a drink together yet!” Guo Xu
        pulled open the door, poked his head, and shouted.
      </p>

      <p>“Ah.” Jiang Cheng waved his hands.</p>

      <p>
        It seemed like these “northerners” weren’t all that with alcohol, after
        all. They had all drank to the point of madness and had already run out
        of alcohol, what the fuck was there even to drink.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since he didn’t bump into Gu Fei in the bathroom, he had probably
        already gone to get Gu Miao some fruits.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng finished up in the toilet and was washing his hands,
        his phone rang. He took it out for a glance, and to his surprise, the
        number he saw was Shen Yiqing’s.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stared at the number for a long time before deciding to accept the
        phone call in the end.
      </p>

      <p>“Xiao Cheng?” Shen Yiqing’s voice came from the other end.</p>

      <p>
        Despite his bit of resistance— and the feelings having also become
        numbed by a lot over time — when he heard this voice, Jiang Cheng still
        felt that the familiar feeling brought to him by the unchanging
        seriousness, calmness, and restraint carried in that voice would
        probably never fade in this lifetime.
      </p>

      <p>“Ah,” he sounded in response.</p>

      <p>“Are you at home?” Shen Yiqing asked.</p>

      <p>
        “No.” Jiang Cheng shut the faucet and felt for a cigarette as he made
        his way outside. He stopped by a window in the corridor, “Eating
        outside.”
      </p>

      <p>“Are you smoking?” Shen Yiqing asked again.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng leaned against the wall and stared outside, suddenly
        feeling very carefree.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shen Yiqing didn’t respond for a long time then finally replied in a
        cold voice: “You really do stay true to yourself no matter where you
        go.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, it’s not that I’m keeping it up, I’m just this type of person,
        aren’t I?” Jiang Cheng twisted his brows, “You called just to ask this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Li Baoguo called me. He said he wanted some money,” Shen Yiqing
        explained. “For tuition and food and the like…”
      </p>

      <p>“He called you?” Jiang Cheng froze.</p>

      <p>
        He had never expected Li Baoguo actually to call and ask Shen Yiqing for
        money – the overwhelming sense of humiliation that overtook him made it
        difficult for him to breathe.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I believe that these expenses are something that should be provided by
        one’s parents, so I didn’t agree.” Shen Yiqing continued, “Is there
        still money in the card that I gave you?”
      </p>

      <p>“Yes.” Jiang Cheng clenched his teeth.</p>

      <p>
        “That money is for you. Even though we aren’t a family anymore, the
        feelings are still there.” Shen Yiqing said, “I hope that you can make
        good use of that money.”
      </p>

      <p>“Got it.” Jiang Cheng took a hard drag of the cigarette.</p>

      <p>“I just wanted to say that. I’ll hang up then,” Shen Yiqing said.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng closed his eyes – the rising smoke made his eyes hurt.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I just want to say one more thing.” Shen Yiqing suddenly spoke again,
        “I hope that you can see your own problems clearly in the new
        environment, don’t always think that your rebellious stage hasn’t
        already passed. Your grades don’t actually determine anything. It’s your
        personality and temper that ultimately decides how your path…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t fucking lecture me!” Jiang Cheng snapped open his eyes, his voice
        hoarse, “I’ve heard enough! It has already been proven a fact that your
        lectures are useless to someone like me! I’m not my little brother! I’m
        not on the same path as you! It has always been this way! Everything you
        say sounds like a lecture to me! And everything you hear from me just
        sounds like thorns! I’m already home now! Are you still not finished?!”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng had screamed the last sentence.</p>

      <p>
        After that, he hung up and stared at the wall in a daze for a long while
        before he put his phone back in his pocket. He turned around, leaned
        against the wall, and raised his head with his eyes closed, taking
        several deep breaths before he finally calmed down and opened his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment he opened them, he saw Gu Fei standing two steps away from
        him with a big plate of fruits in his hands.
      </p>

      <p>He stared at Gu Fei, not knowing what to say.</p>

      <p>
        “Want some?” Gu Fei handed him the plate, “I just had the waiter cut
        some.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took a piece of the watermelon: “You’ll get brain damage
        from eating out of season fruit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yet, you’re still eating it?” Gu Fei put the plate on a small table
        next to them and then also took a piece of watermelon.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m too smart,” Jiang Cheng said. “So, I have to eat some to become a
        little more average. I’m striving to be able to think on the same level
        as my biological father, Li Baoguo.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Li Baoguo isn’t that extremely stupid. He’s pretty good at counting
        cards,” Gu Fei said, smiling.
      </p>

      <p>
        “He’s also pretty good at asking for money.” Jiang Cheng felt another
        wave of suffocation once the words left his mouth. He thought that the
        outburst directed at Shen Yiqing just now had solely stemmed from Li
        Baoguo having demanded her for money, making him lose his confidence and
        standpoint. He harshly bit at the watermelon, “Fuck.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you always eat the watermelon rind?” Gu Fei stared at him in shock.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shut up!” Jiang Cheng spat the watermelon rind that he had chewed into
        the trash can beside them, “This is how us city people all eat.”
      </p>

      <p>“Got it.” Gu Fei laughed as he ate.</p>

      <p>
        An air of melancholy surrounded Jiang Cheng, weighing heavily on him at
        the moment. To him, his emotions felt distinctly unstable and easily
        affected, and all the happiness that was amassed from the initially
        pleasant and relaxing evening was all lost with a single phone call.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t even want to return to the room now. The room full of people
        that had made him feel happy may just become a source of his
        irritability now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t say anything unnecessary and acted as though he wasn’t in
        a hurry to return to the room. The two of them quietly stand next to a
        table in the corridor and eat away at the fruits on the plate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Watermelon, oranges, cherry tomatoes… having eaten a full stomach of
        meat, eating some fruit to relieve the greasiness was the perfect
        remedy.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was not until they had wholly devoured all the fruits that he looked
        up and exchanged a glance with Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We just ate all of Queen Miao Miao’s fruit,” Jiang Cheng wiped his
        mouth.
      </p>

      <p>“En, I’ll get her another plate,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Did you just overhear another unbelievably big secret?” Jiang Cheng
        peered at him. The cold fruit gradually neutralized the slightly
        feverish feeling in his body caused by the alcohol and heat.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It doesn’t really count as some big secret,” Gu Fei said. “The fact
        that your adoption was reversed is something that I already knew about…
        just now, was that… your adopted mother?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah.” Jiang Cheng nodded, drawing strokes on the plate then using the
        remaining water to draw a series of notes slowly, “Li Baoguo asked her
        for money.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei arched his eyebrows in surprise but didn’t say a word.</p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei,” Jiang Cheng recklessly wiped away the notes, “There must’ve
        been times when you’re especially troubled, right? How did you deal with
        it? The way you live so carefree<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> all the time,
        it doesn’t seem like you’re pretending.”
      </p>

      <p>“Have some alcohol and a good night of sleep,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>“Really?” Jiang Cheng frowned, “Did it work?”</p>

      <p>“Nope,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>“Are you kidding with me?” Jiang Cheng glared at him.</p>

      <p>
        “What solution could there be? It’ll be fine once you’re used to it,” Gu
        Fei said, “There are way too many things to worry about in this world, I
        can’t be bothered with all of them.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The two were still standing in the corridor, neither having the
        intention to move as they just stared in a daze at the empty plate
        together.
      </p>

      <p>After a while, Jiang Cheng heard the sound of a skateboard.</p>

      <p>“En?” Gu Fei turned his head around.</p>

      <p>
        “Gu Miao?” Jiang Cheng looked up to see Gu Miao sliding out of the room,
        hugging his and Gu Fei’s jackets and school bags in her arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>! Slow down Miao Miao, your brother…” Wang Xu ran out in
        alarm, and chased after her, with his jacket in hand. He let out a
        breath of relief when he spotted Gu Fei and Jiang Cheng standing in the
        corridor, “Fuck! I thought the two of you had eloped! Hurry up, let’s
        go, let’s go!”
      </p>

      <p>“We’re done here?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Done, my ass!” Wang Xu explained as he put on his jacket, “We’re
        changing locations! We’re going to karaoke!”
      </p>

      <p>“I’m not going,” Jiang Cheng quickly said in a low voice.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei glanced at him then turned to give Wang Xu a nod: “Alright, let’s
        go.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Everybody had come out of the room; now, it was noisy and exciting
        outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        After leaving the restaurant, everybody immediately made their way
        across the street and seeing how familiar Wang Xu was with the road, he
        most likely picked this place out as well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng walked at the very back. After everybody made it across the
        street, he saw Gu Fei still standing on the side of the road with Gu
        Miao.
      </p>

      <p>“What wrong?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“Didn’t you say that you weren’t going?” Gu Fei questioned.</p>

      <p>
        “… I said that I’m not going,” Jiang Cheng paused. “But if you want to
        go then go <em>ah</em>, you don’t have to keep me accompany.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m not going either. I have to take Er Miao back to sleep.” Gu Fei
        ruffled Er Miao’s head, “If you weren’t here today, I wouldn’t even come
        out to eat.”
      </p>

      <p>“Why not?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “It’s meaningless.” Gu Fei said and stretched his body before pushing
        the bicycle to a taxi at the side of the road. “Let’s go,
        Cheng-<em>ge</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        With Gu Miao already sleepy, Gu Fei didn’t make her continue
        skateboarding the way home. He stuffed the bicycle in the trunk, and
        they took a taxi back.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you…” Jiang Cheng hesitated for a long while and only when he
        spotted the street sign at the intersection, did he finally squeezed out
        a sentence, “Are you heading straight home?”
      </p>

      <p>“Where do you want to go?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know.” Jiang Cheng rubbed his forehead, “I just don’t want to
        go back to Li Baoguo’s place.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei made a sound in response.</p>

      <p>
        When the taxi stopped in front of Gu Fei’s shop, the lights were still
        on – surprisingly. Jiang Cheng got out and immediately saw Gu Fei’s
        mother inside. After all this time, this was the very first time that he
        saw her staying in the shop past nine o’clock.
      </p>

      <p>“Wait for me,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng watched as he took Gu Miao into the shop and handed
        her over to his mother. He then walked around the shelves a few times
        and came back out with a big plastic bag in his hand filled with many
        things.
      </p>

      <p>“What’s all this?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Stuff to eat, peanuts, jerky, and whatever else.” Gu Fei replied as he
        turned and walked ahead.
      </p>

      <p>“Where are we going?” Jiang Cheng caught up and walked beside him.</p>

      <p>
        “The steel mills.” Gu Fei glanced at him, “Didn’t you say that you
        didn’t want to go back?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything, only giving him a firm thumbs up.</p>

      <p>
        From the looks of it, someone had come to the small room in the steel
        mill in the past few days. The room was so clean that even the cloth on
        the sofa with the broken leg had been replaced.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Li Yan is so virtuous and considerate.” Gu Fei put the bags of things
        on the table then skillfully lit a fire in the stove that was in the
        middle of the room. “He basically cleaned up everything in this room.
      </p>

      <p>
        “He doesn’t look virtuous at all.” Jiang Cheng plopped down on the sofa
        and let out a long sigh of relief. He felt his body relax by a lot for
        some inexplicable reason. “What did you bring to eat? Let me see.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei placed the bag beside him.</p>

      <p>
        In addition to all sorts of peanuts and beef jerky, there were also a
        bunch of chicken and fish fillets, and even sausages and instant
        noodles; the bag was filled to the brim. Jiang Cheng laughed, “This
        ration is enough for us to drink till tomorrow morning.”
      </p>

      <p>“You can still drink?” Gu Fei turned around.</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t be prejudiced towards us southerners.” Jiang Cheng opened a bag
        of peanuts and put some in his mouth, slowly chewing on it. “We
        southerners just drink a little slower, especially a fashionable
        southern city boy like me, we drink even slower…”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei started laughing: “Let me see if there’s any alcohol left.”</p>

      <p>
        “If not, then let’s go back to the shop to get some.” Jiang Cheng found
        a cigarette.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yes, boss.” Gu Fei picked up a few cardboard boxes by the wall and
        shifted through them. He pulled out two bottles of white liquor,
        “Hongxing Erguotou<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>, those guys have changed
        their tastes recently.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s still erguotou either way, uncultured boy.” Jiang Cheng stretched
        his legs with a cigarette hanging in his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>“Should I also pour it for you?” Gu Fei looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Of course,” Jiang Cheng replied. “I don’t want to move, not in the
        mood.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Remember this moment well, Cheng-<em>ge</em>.” Gu Fei kicked the small
        table over to the side of his legs, poured the liquor, and placed it in
        front of him. Then he got some disposable plates, opened a bunch of
        snacks, and dumped them out. “Except for Er Miao, I have never served
        someone like this before.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wasn’t the service pretty good the last time we ate barbecue here?”
        Jiang Cheng smirked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then start engraving it in your memory from last time,” Gu Fei sat down
        beside him.
      </p>

      <p>“Oh.” Jiang Cheng picked up his cup and took a gulp, “Really?”</p>

      <p>“Really.” Gu Fei picked up a piece of jerky and slowly tore at it.</p>

      <p>
        “That’s hard to believe. Haven’t you ever had a girl… boy… boyfriend or
        girlfriend or something before?” Jiang Cheng asked.
      </p>

      <p>“I haven’t,” Gu Fei simply answered.</p>

      <p>“… Oh.” Jiang Cheng turned to look at him.</p>

      <p>
        He gave himself three seconds of silence for suddenly raising such an
        inherently awkward question and being unable to continue the
        conversation.

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Then…” Gu Fei also picked up a slice of beef jerky and put it in his
        mouth before he leaned against the sofa and chewed on it lethargically.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng stared at the slice of jerky in his hands, feeling as if he
        was looking at the grave he had dug with his own hands. He didn’t even
        need to guess what Gu Fei was about to ask next – it was the reaction
        expected from any average person.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">“What about you?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">Jiang Cheng sighed internally.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        He didn’t want to lie, but this wasn’t a matter he was willing to
        discuss. He had no idea how he could form an explanation without making
        himself seem like a scumbag that fed on both men and women.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        After asking that, Gu Fei continued to slowly take sips of the alcohol,
        not questioning further.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Yet, this considerate attitude actually left Jiang Cheng feeling
        uncomfortable. It made the situation seem as if there really was
        something shameful about him that he couldn’t speak of.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Before…” He hesitated. “… there was a… uh, a girlfriend that couldn’t
        quite be called a girlfriend. From my class.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “A girl?” Gu Fei turned around to look at him in surprise.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “En,” Jiang Cheng lit another cigarette. The charcoal fire in the room
        was already blazing, the warm air washed over them in waves, warming the
        alcohol in their bodies to a very comfortable level. It was to the level
        that made one suddenly feel as if it was okay to speak of anything, “She
        sat at the desk in front of me.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Oh,” Gu Fei continued to gaze at him. “I thought you… couldn’t accept
        girls.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “I’m not too sure either.” Jiang Cheng rested his head against the sofa
        cushion with his head facing the ceiling. “I’ve never had a boyfriend
        either, so I don’t know what it feels like, it’s just that I…”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng cleared his throat and stared intently into the ceiling that
        seemed to be swirling very slowly in front of his eyes: “… have always
        only been interested in guys. But when she pursued me, I didn’t feel
        anything wrong with it either. I’m annoyed with her not because she’s a
        girl but because she is actually annoying.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re annoyed with everyone,” Gu Fei laughed. “When I first saw you,
        it seemed like you were going to start fighting anytime, anywhere.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m short-tempered, but I usually try to keep it under control. If I
        can’t control it anymore, then fuck that, whatever, I don’t care.”<a
          href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
        Jiang Cheng also started smiling with him, “Honestly, I’m really not
        annoyed with her because of my own reason, you know… when some girls
        start acting bitchy,<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> they will fly directly to
        Mars if you give them a pair of wings.”<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m not familiar with this,” Gu Fei laughed for a long time from what
        he said. “I’ve never been willing to be close with girls.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I can see that. You were afraid that Yi Jing would get onto your bike
        today, weren’t you?” Jiang Cheng tilted his head,“Aiyou, that escape you
        made, are you not afraid that she’ll understand the reason and feel
        awkward?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Better than giving her the chance to confess and be rejected,” Gu Fei
        responded.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s true,” Jiang Cheng readily gave him a thumbs up. “Good guy.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei moved aside the hand that almost stabbed him in the face with a
        cigarette: “You and your girl… friend, have you broken up already?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En. We broke up before I came here. Actually, we were together for less
        than a few days.” Jiang Cheng put out the cigarette, picked up the
        jacket that Gu Fei had tossed to the side, and felt inside the pocket,
        “I don’t think she wasn’t very reluctant either. She contacted me twice
        but didn’t bother again, probably moved on to find a new flame. Nobody
        dates seriously in high school anyways… it only counts as long-distance
        when you’re only a few grades apart, none of it would have lasted.”
      </p>

      <p>“Looking for mint candy?” Gu Fei asked. “It’s in that pocket.”</p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng switched to the other side and fished out two pieces.
        He unwrapped one and popped it into his mouth. The cool and refreshing
        taste opened a tumultuous channel from his throat to his nose and his
        brain before quickly disappearing. “Actually, when you said that you
        didn’t want to get close to girls, that’s not entirely correct. Isn’t
        Ding Zhuxin pretty close with you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, she counts as an exception <em>ba</em>.” Gu Fei ripped apart a bag
        of peanuts, took one in his hands, and slowly rubbed away the skin. “Her
        house used to be on the floor above mine, so I used to often go to her
        house and play. Whenever my dad started beating people, I would go to
        her house to hide.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng let out a light sigh.</p>

      <p>
        “Her house could be called… my safe haven when I was little.” Gu Fei
        tossed the peanut into his mouth, “I was always afraid of my dad. If he
        yelled once, I would be too scared to sleep for a whole night. And even
        if I managed to fall asleep, it would be a night full of nightmares.”
      </p>

      <p>“How much older than you is she?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Five years,” Gu Fei replied. “Actually, she wasn’t very old at the
        time, but she was very good at comforting people and had a mind of her
        own. I just felt like she was my support.”
      </p>

      <p>“The boss’ boss <em>ah</em>,” Jiang Cheng stated.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei smiled: “I didn’t have a very good personality either as a kid. I
        didn’t have many friends so I would chat with her a lot. Whenever I ran
        into a problem, I would immediately think of discussing it with her
        first.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Really?” Jiang Cheng was a little surprised. It turned out that Gu Fei
        wasn’t born naturally unperturbed as he appeared. “She does give others
        the feeling of… being very capable.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t respond.</p>

      <p>
        “Are you guys now…” Jiang Cheng stared at him, remembering the text Ding
        Zhuxin had sent him that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We don’t talk as much now,” Gu Fei said. “The relationships between
        people are bound to change. There’s no such thing as a relationship that
        would stay the same for a lifetime.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng could pretty much understand what Gu Fei meant by putting
        together Ding Zhuxin’s attitude towards him. A xueba’s thinking was very
        astute after a couple of drinks, and his words wouldn’t be as inhibited.
      </p>

      <p>“She likes you, right?” he asked.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei raised his eyebrows: “Is it too obvious, or are you just too
        astute ah?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “My IQ is at least a hundred of Wang Jiuri’s higher than yours,” Jiang
        Cheng pointed to his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        “A head full of Wang Jiuri,” Gu Fei smiled and took out another peanut.
        “That’s not quite appropriate, especially when his head is just full of
        Yi Jing.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck off!” Jiang Cheng immediately changed the direction of the finger
        that was pointing at his forehead, to pointing at Gu Fei instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed but didn’t respond. Jiang Cheng sighed and took another
        sip of alcohol, relishing in the satisfying and burning sensation that
        traveled all the way down to his stomach, then laughed along with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>,” Jiang Cheng touched his own forehead. “She knows about
        you, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En. Confession, rejection, and coming out all accomplished in a single
        move,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>“So fucking harsh,” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Just like I’ve said, it’s better to stay away in the beginning than to
        reject later,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah,” Jiang Cheng closed his eyes. “It feels troublesome just to even
        think about it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s troublesome about it? Didn’t you have a girlfriend?” Gu Fei
        replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No, it’s not the same,” Jiang Cheng shook his head, which immediately
        caused the world around him to spin<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>, so he
        hastily stopped. “I don’t hate girls. I’m actually quite willing to look
        at beautiful ones, but I don’t have any… impulses, you know. Not having
        any unspeakable thoughts toward pretty girls, it shouldn’t be this way.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed so hard that the alcohol in his cup spilled out: “Then do
        you have any unspeakable thoughts towards handsome guys?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Of course,” Jiang Cheng felt the alcohol settle in. He had already
        spilled out everything he needed to say… it was just that he was a
        little dizzy, and his mood had been shifting in a very untrammeled
        manner throughout the night. He became very reckless<a href="#_ftn5"
          >[5]</a
        >
        as if he had something to vent, “Haven’t you?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei coughed twice but didn’t respond.</p>

      <p>
        “You wanna say no?” Jiang Cheng gazed at him with narrowed eyes. “How
        very dishonest of you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took a sip of alcohol, wanting to ease his mood. But when the
        alcohol simmered down, it, on the contrary, caused his mood to be
        licentious. Hence, alcohol and the like could unravel not only a
        thousand sorrows but also a thousand clothes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s tolerance wasn’t bad. He still hadn’t passed out at this
        point – he just turned into another person.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Man up,” Jiang Cheng leaned to one side, bent a leg onto the sofa, and
        rested an arm against the backrest of the sofa.
      </p>

      <p><em>This phrase again.</em> Gu Fei sighed, “Yeah, I have.”</p>

      <p>
        “That’s more like it.” Jiang Cheng started to laugh, probably feeling a
        little dizzy as he tilted his head to rest it on his arm. “It’s such a
        normal thing.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>
        It<em> was </em>a very normal thing. However, if Jiang Cheng knew that
        he had acted “normally” towards <em>him </em>multiple times already, who
        knew what sort of expression he would end up having?
      </p>

      <p>
        “I…” Jiang Cheng continued to laugh for a while before stopping, his
        voice lowering, “… really must’ve had too much to drink tonight.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s not like you drink every day,” Gu Fei slid downwards and leaned
        against the sofa, tilting his head back to rest on the cushion. “An
        occasional drink here and there is fine, I—”
      </p>

      <p>
        Before he could finish the sentence, Jiang Cheng’s slightly cold
        fingertips touched his earlobe. He froze, yet his initial reaction was
        not astonishment, he instead wondered why Jiang Cheng’s hands were cold
        even though he had a whole night’s worth of drinks.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tiny bit of coolness slowly traced from beside his ear to his neck,
        and only when it reached his collarbones did he finally whipped his head
        around to look at Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You had them for me too, right?” Jiang Cheng asked with his head tilted
        to the side.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this moment, Gu Fei should have finally had the urge to go to the
        bathroom to fill a basin of cold water and splash it on Jiang Cheng’s
        face. Jiang Cheng, who had always been avoidant of this sort of thing,
        actually spoke out words like these after a few sips of fake alcohol.<a
          href="#_ftn6"
          >[6]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei glanced at the alcohol bottle on the table – it was a 56% Da’
        Er.<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> If you wanted to catch a promotion, a box of
        12 bottles would cost no more than around a hundred. There really was no
        point for Li Yan to buy the fake ones just for the sake of being cheap.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s finger flicked against his cheek: “I’m asking you a
        question.”
      </p>

      <p>“No,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        He admitted that Jiang Cheng’s series of actions and speech was like a
        bottle of liquor injected directly into his veins. The impulsions he had
        now could entirely bulldoze through a steel board, but his constant
        state of repression allowed him to make use of the last remains of his
        willpower.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Jiang Cheng swore under his breath. “Are you a fucking coward,
        or do you have problems?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei was unexpectedly speechless at this moment.</p>

      <p>
        “During the photoshoot the other day…” Jiang Cheng suddenly stood up by
        supporting himself on the back of the sofa. He kneeled on the sofa with
        one knee and gazed down on him, condescendingly, “You couldn’t have
        gotten hard because of the sofa, right?”
      </p>

      <p><em>Holy! Fuck! </em></p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei felt a loud ringing resonating in his head, as if two strikes of
        lightning had struck down on him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He never expected that Jiang Cheng would notice such details, much less
        speak about it in such a blatant manner.
      </p>

      <p>This was too out of character for a person like Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        “I have great eyesight,” Jiang Cheng tapped the tip of his nose again
        with his finger. “I don’t wear glasses.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Although Gu Fei was extremely shocked, he was unable to refrain from
        laughing at this. “My glasses have a very low prescription.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t change the subject,” Jiang Cheng stared at him. Even though the
        slight instability in his gaze could be seen, the aggressiveness it held
        was apparent at a glance, “Was it the sofa or me?”
      </p>

      <p>“You,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng said nothing in reply. He turned his head to the side and
        spat out the mint candy in his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei wanted to say, ‘Aren’t you just amazing, being able to hold a
        piece of candy in your mouth for such a long time,’ but those words
        didn’t get a chance to escape his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng suddenly stooped down and kissed his lips.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei had no experience in kissing and judging by how Jiang Cheng
        carried himself ordinarily – hacking at anyone who merely touched him
        out of a conditioned reflex – he shouldn’t have had any experiences in
        this area either.
      </p>

      <p>But this sort of thing…</p>

      <p>
        When the tip of Jiang Cheng’s mint-flavored tongue squeezed into his
        mouth from between his teeth, Gu Fei grabbed his collar and yanked him
        down even closer to himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        The hand Jiang Cheng had placed on the back of the sofa to support
        himself slipped off, so he took the chance to wind his arms around him.
        He grabbed onto his clothes and gave it a harsh yank, then proceeded to
        snake his hands under the fabric and roughly grope at Gu Fei’s waist.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this moment, Jiang Cheng felt like the pile of mush that was his
        brain had vanished. He wasn’t able to think nor feel – even thoughts
        like “fuck, this feels so good” had shattered into the air.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had lost sensation from every organ in his body like they ceased to
        exist, leaving only his lips and tongue as what remained on his body… as
        well as the source of evil on his lower half. It was as if he became
        independent from his bodily senses and earthly control, making him exert
        all his capabilities unconsciously.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s response was passionate, which surrounded by the warm and
        mellifluous air, incited Jiang Cheng’s mind to be tempted to ruthlessly
        bite down on him multiple times. It was as if only through a
        confrontation such as that could he release all the pent-up desires that
        just grew more abundant, passionate, and unbearable as they converged in
        his body.
      </p>

      <p>
        Occasionally, when his sense of hearing returned, he would make out the
        sound of heavy breathing from both him and Gu Fei – but he was unable to
        decipher whose was louder, whose was lower, whose was lighter, nor whose
        was heavier.
      </p>

      <p>
        And occasionally, when his sense of touch returned, he could feel Gu
        Fei’s tight and smooth skin under his palm as well as the bursts of
        electricity that followed behind every stroke that Gu Fei made on his
        skin.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two collapsed into the sofa. Jiang Cheng’s hand slipped into Gu
        Fei’s pants, and simultaneously, Gu Fei yanked down on his waistband. It
        was only at this point that all the parts of his body was revived.
      </p>

      <p>
        That strong – never experienced before – tremor that rose from his lower
        abdomen and shot straight through his heart instantly submerged him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fire in the stove blazed, its sparks visibly jumping to and fro.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng sat down on the floor, leaning against the sofa.</p>

      <p>
        His head was still feeling dizzy, and his whole body felt both fatigued
        and weak. This was not only because of the alcohol but also due to the
        extreme excitement his body had experienced just moments before that
        left him feeling hollowed out.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know when he had fallen to the ground, but when he finally
        regained clarity, he found himself sitting here while Gu Fei was leaning
        against the sofa… both of them were silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        His butt could feel the coolness of the floor seeping in, but he didn’t
        want to move. He continued to stare at the balls of tissue and the cup
        that Gu Fei had at some point thrown to the ground, as well as the
        alcohol that spilled out and had yet to dry.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a while, Gu Fei threw a cushion to his side: “The floor’s cold.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He was dazed for a few moments more before reaching out for the cushion.
        He then sat back down with the cushion positioned under him.
      </p>

      <p>“Do you want a cigarette?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“An after-the-matter smoke?” Jiang Cheng turned and eyed him.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei smiled but didn’t speak. He passed over the cigarette box, and
        Jiang Cheng took one out and lit it. He then continued to daze off with
        the cigarette dangling in his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you don’t want to go back,” Gu Fei said. “You can sleep here. This
        is a pullout sofa.”
      </p>

      <p>“What time is it?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei fished around for a moment but couldn’t find his cellphone: “I
        don’t know where I stuck my phone.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked around but couldn’t find his own cellphone either.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both their cellphones were initially tossed somewhere on the sofa, but
        now they had both disappeared. His face suddenly started to burn a
        little. They had only masturbated once, but this one masturbation
        session turned out to be so earth-shattering. He felt that if the sofa
        hadn’t already broken a leg, then today would definitely be the day that
        it broke one.
      </p>

      <p><em>Then how did the sofa leg break before?</em></p>

      <p>
        A series of censored scenes immediately flashed through Jiang Cheng’s
        brain.
      </p>

      <p><em>How shameless!</em></p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei found both their mobile phones on the sofa; they were under the
        cloth covering that had already been rolled into a ball by them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took it from him and eyed the screen – it wasn’t even
        midnight yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        This time was neither early nor late. If he was to go back now, he was
        too lazy to move, but if he were to spend the night here, it would seem
        to be an endlessly long night.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei, on the other hand, didn’t seem to be hesitant whatsoever. He sat
        near the stove, fished out a few sweet potatoes from the cardboard box
        nearby, and threw them into the fire.
      </p>

      <p>“You’re hungry, ah?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei used a stick to stir the fire, burying the sweet potatoes
        under the charcoal ashes, “You want some?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Will it be fully cooked like this?” Jiang Cheng was a little worried.
      </p>

      <p>
        “A city boy like you doesn’t understand, huh,” Gu Fei said. “We country
        people always eat sweet potatoes covered in ashes.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng smiled: “Fuck off.”</p>

      <p>
        After the passion faded away, coldness started to seep into his hollowed
        body. Jiang Cheng kicked the little stool beside him to the edge of the
        stove, getting ready to sit down and warm up near the fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        When his peripheral vision landed on the tissues balled up on the floor,
        a wave of uncomfortable awkwardness immediately washed over him. There
        was a constant nagging feeling that someone was going to walk in at any
        given moment and be able to tell what the hell those tissues had been
        used for.
      </p>

      <p>
        He hastily walked over, not caring whose it was, picked them all up, and
        balled them together. Having walked around the room without seeing a
        garbage can, grasping a hand full of this stuff wasn’t exactly the most
        comfortable experience, so he threw them right into the brick stove.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tissue ball instantly became a golden flame ball, emitting a burst
        of black smoke.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck?” Gu Fei froze, “What did you throw in there?”</p>

      <p>“The tissue, from just now,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>“The used ones, ah?” Gu Fei looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Ah.” Jiang Cheng also stared back at him, “What nonsense are you
        spouting, why would I throw it away if it wasn’t used.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s food below it, and you throw in that thing…” Gu Fei sighed,
        “Whatever, they’re all burned to death anyway.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck,” Jiang Cheng was left speechless because of him. “How come I
        couldn’t tell that you were so fussy from how you usually act?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m not fussy, I’m too lazy even to clean up the tissues,” Gu Fei said.
        “I’m just freely expressing my thoughts.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng no longer wanted to speak. He sat down beside Gu Fei and
        watched the flame flicker in a daze.
      </p>

      <p>
        The drunkenness did not pass, but the dizziness was slowly starting to
        dissipate. The feeling had turned into softness, and just sitting there
        made him feel tired. He stared intently at the floor and kicked back the
        stool until his legs could stretch out and rest against the wall.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was no longer a sense of awkwardness, only an inexplicable feeling
        of loss.
      </p>

      <p>
        Until the sweet potatoes were well cooked, the two never spoke a word.
        But it didn’t seem like either of them was like this because they were
        embarrassed.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei took out a paper plate and handed him a sweet potato.</p>

      <p>
        The outer layer was burned into a hard shell, but once it was peeled
        away, a fragrant and sweet scent filled his nose.
      </p>

      <p>“It’s really fragrant,” he commented.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei picked up one for himself, “When I was small, I liked to
        hide in a place where no one was present, dig a hole, start a bonfire,
        and just bake sweet potatoes to eat like this.”
      </p>

      <p>“Were you very lonely in your childhood?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Yes.” Gu Fei nodded his head, “But I no longer felt lonely when Er Miao
        appeared, just annoyed to death.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng smiled.</p>

      <p>
        After he finished the sweet potato, his stomach was filled with a
        perpetuated warmth, and Jiang Cheng started to feel sleepy. It was a
        little difficult even to keep his eyes open.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go sleep, there are blankets here. Li Yan brought them over, but I
        don’t think they’ve ever been used,” Gu Fei dropped a few pieces of
        charcoal into the stove, then he stood up and pulled out a bag from the
        old closet pushed against the wall beside them. “I’ll… go back in a
        bit.”
      </p>

      <p>“…you’re going back now?” Jiang Cheng asked, startled.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei glanced at him, then looked into the bag: “There’s only one
        blanket.”
      </p>

      <p>“…oh,” Jiang Cheng sounded in response.</p>

      <p>
        After continuing to daze off for a while, he grew too tired to endure
        it. Hence, he stood up and walked over to the sofa to pull it open and
        lay it down flat. Once he laid down, a wave of comfort instantly washed
        over him. He then pulled the blanket over to cover himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei sat unmoving at the side. Jiang Cheng’s eyelids were vigorously
        fighting against him, and he was already too lazy to ask again, so he
        just closed his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he felt that he had nearly fallen asleep, the sofa moved lightly –
        Gu Fei had sat down on the edge.
      </p>

      <p>“You’re not going back?” Jiang Cheng opened his eyes.</p>

      <p>“You’re not asleep yet?” Gu Fei turned his head around.</p>

      <p>“No,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>
        “I also don’t feel like moving.” Gu Fei pulled over a cushion,
        positioned it underneath his head, and laid down, “Squeeze together for
        the night?”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng pulled a portion of the blanket in his direction.</p>

      <p>
        He had initially felt quite sleepy, but once Gu Fei laid down, he
        couldn’t fall asleep anymore. Obviously, he had been so drowsy that
        tears had started flowing down his face, yet he was now completely
        unable to drift to sleep.
      </p>

      <p>It was definitely going to be a sleepless night for him.</p>

      <p>“You awake?” Gu Fei asked from beside him.</p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng answered. “Can’t fall asleep.”</p>

      <p>“Can’t sleep in a new place?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“Not that.” Jiang Cheng sighed, “Where’s your phone?”</p>

      <p>“Why?” Gu Fei turned around.</p>

      <p>
        “I’ll help you pass a few levels of that retarded Craz3 Match game,”
        Jiang Cheng said. “Usually, such a boring and retarded game would bring
        me right to sleep after a few rounds.”
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck,” Gu Fei laughed and handed him the phone.</p>

      <p>
        In actuality, although Jiang Cheng liked to call this thing retarded,
        the levels further back was actually challenging – Gu Fei had already
        proven himself to be very capable for being able to play this far.
      </p>

      <p>
        It wasn’t as if he could get past any level as he pleased – luck was
        still very important.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a case like today, where he had drunk his fill of alcohol and lost
        his mind, his luck was probably already down the drain. “This retarded
        Craz3 Match game” had become, “This hateful Craz3 Match game”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei had saved up over 20 hearts, but he used up half of them before
        finally getting past the first level.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>,” he sighed lightly. “It’s not going too smoothly today, it
        took me this long just to get past one level.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei made no sound in response.</p>

      <p>
        He shifted his gaze to his side only to see that Gu Fei had his head
        slanted to the side, unexpectedly fast asleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Jiang Cheng threw aside his phone in an irritated manner, pulled
        up the blanket, and lied down.
        <em>Pass levels for you, my ass.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The light in the room was left on. Even though the lousy lights weren’t
        very bright, it was enough to clearly make out Gu Fei’s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stared intently at Gu Fei’s profile, gazing as the shadows formed
        from his profile slowly danced across his face, then watched as they
        gradually blurred into a whole, until finally, the surroundings also
        slowly dimmed away.
      </p>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p data-adtags-visited="true"></p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        That night, Jiang Cheng slept rather soundly. Before he fell asleep, he
        had thought that he might be plagued by a dream or two, but it was all a
        blank sheet, and he slept straight through to the next day, only waking
        up from the bitter cold.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The sky outside was bright – he guessed that it was probably around
        seven or eight o’clock in the morning. The fire in the room had already
        died out, and the wind freely flowed in from the cracks in the windows.
        Jiang Cheng immediately let out a series of sneezes the moment he opened
        his eyes.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        He stretched his hand out to the side and felt around, but there was
        nobody there.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        He turned his head and discovered that Gu Fei was no longer beside him.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        But before he could be surprised by the fact that Gu Fei had actually
        gotten up so early in the morning on a weekend, he froze as what had
        transpired the night before dawned on him.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng sat up and reached his hand into his hair, roughly grabbing
        at it.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">The alcohol had worn off.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">The insanity had also worn off.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        But the awkwardness, strangely, hadn’t settled in yet.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Now, the only thing surrounding him was a vague sense of panic.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        <em>Jiang Cheng, what the hell have you done?!</em>
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        <em
          >The point is, what’s done is done, but now, the person that you did

          fucking person is this?!</em
        >
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng jumped off the sofa and circled the room twice, checking to
        see if Gu Fei’s clothes, schoolbag, and everything else were all gone.
        <em>That cowardly son of a bitch fled without leaving a trace?</em
        ><em></em>
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        <em>Did he have to go that far?!</em>

          >Even if it was just a casual hook up! There’s no need to flee in

        >
      </p>

      <p><em>Wouldn’t that just make it awkward…</em></p>

      <p>
        The only feeling that Jiang Cheng felt right then and there was that of
        utter fucking shame!
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fucking piece of shit!” He cursed silently to himself and grabbed his
        phone, dialing Gu Fei’s number after sneezing a couple of times.
      </p>

      <p>
        After barely two rings, he suddenly heard the sound of a cell phone
        ringing from the other side of the door.
      </p>

      <p><em>Someone’s here?</em></p>

      <p><em>Who is it?!</em></p>

      <p><em>Bu Shi Hao Niao?</em></p>

      <p><em>Li Yan?</em></p>

      <p><em>Or maybe Ding Zhuxin?</em></p>

      <p><em>Fuck</em>, <em>has the crime scene been cleaned properly?</em></p>

      <p>
        When he finally realized that the ringtone outside the door was actually
        Gu Fei’s, he had already gotten a back full of cold sweat from shock.
      </p>

      <p>
        The door was pushed open, and Gu Fei came in carrying two steaming hot
        boxes of fast food: “Did you call me?”
      </p>

      <p>“Ah,” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Hurry up and eat, it’s pho.” Gu Fei placed the boxes on the small
        table, “Li Yan just called me to go to the shop, so I went over to
        unlock it first.”
      </p>

      <p>“He’s at the shop right now?” Jiang Cheng questioned.</p>

      <p>“Not yet. He’ll head over in a bit though,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “So, you just left the door to the shop open like that? With no one
        there?” Jiang Cheng asked yet again.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei replied. “There won’t be anybody going in to steal at this
        time of the day, the thieves are all asleep by now after keeping
        themselves busy through the night.”
      </p>

      <p>“… oh.” Jiang Cheng sat down.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took a small and long packet from his pocket and threw it in
        front of him.
      </p>

      <p>“Wasabi?” That was Jiang Cheng’s first response.</p>

      <p>
        “You even add wasabi when you’re eating pho?”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Gu
        Fei lowered his head and started to eat the noodles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took a closer look and saw that it was actually an
        individually packaged mouthwash: “Your shop also has this kind of thing,
        huh?”
      </p>

      <p>“What? My shop is pretty <em>in vogue</em>,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng laughed for a long time, then went to the bathroom to wash
        his face, rinsed his mouth, and sat back down to eat his noodles.
      </p>

      <p>
        A silent atmosphere encased them as they ate, but that didn’t matter
        since Jiang Cheng didn’t really feel like talking at the moment – his
        previous speculation about Gu Fei actually made him a little
        embarrassed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides… he actually hadn’t felt too awkward when he got up. Maybe it
        was because he was too busy sneezing, being shocked, and getting angry
        to even care.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that he was quietly eating the warm pho, the restlessness and panic
        in his body boldly showed its head.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you going back home?” Gu Fei wiped his mouth after finishing the
        noodles, “It seems Li Yan needs me for something today. If he doesn’t
        find me in the shop in a bit, he might come here. I have to head back
        now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then hurry up and go,” Jiang Cheng hastily said the moment he heard
        that. He didn’t want to be seen by others regardless of who it was or
        whether or not they had the ability to tell what had happened here. “I’m
        leaving too.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei stuffed the snacks on the table in a bag and tossed it into
        a cardboard box on the side, then put the garbage in another bag.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng followed him out the door, prolonging the silence the entire
        way.
      </p>

      <p>
        After having something warm, he discovered that it really wasn’t all
        that cold that day. But for some reason, even though the wind wasn’t
        strong at all, he didn’t know why he had the chills.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they reached the intersection leading away from the steel mill, Gu
        Fei stopped. He needed to go to the left, but Gu Fei’s place was to the
        right.
      </p>

      <p>“Umm,” Gu Fei glanced at him. “You’re going back home?”</p>

      <p>
        “En,” Jiang Cheng nodded, took two steps to the small road on the left,
        then turned around and slowly backed up. “Um… I’ll leave now.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei sounded in response but didn’t move.</p>

      <p>
        After a few steps, Jiang Cheng cleared his throat, not knowing what else
        he could say. So he waved at Gu Fei, turned, and walked down the road.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he reached the downstairs of Li Baoguo’s place, he saw Li Baoguo
        walking in with quick steps from far across the street.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as he saw this person, he immediately thought of the phone call
        from Shen Yiqing the day before. There was a knot in his heart that rose
        almost directly to the top of his throat, so he stopped in his steps,
        wanting to wait for Li Baoguo to come back and fall asleep before
        entering.
      </p>

      <p>
        But as Li Baoguo approached, he noticed two women following behind him,
        wearing matching clothes that appeared to be salesman uniforms.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Uncle.” A young woman jogged up on Li Baoguo and said, “Uncle, it was
        indeed our mistake for making the wrong call, but you can’t just deny
        it!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know what you’re talking about! I never picked up any calls!”
        Li Baoguo said with a loud voice while waving them away, “Don’t follow
        me anymore!”
      </p>

      <p>
        The other woman was a bit anxious: “Just look at how old you are now!
        How can you be so uncultured?!?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who’s uncultured? Who’s uncultured?” Li Baoguo whipped his head around
        and glared straight at her, “Every single day, you both keep on saying
        that I took your things! How cultured are you, framing people?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Uncle, how did we frame you?!” The young woman cried with a sobbing
        tone, “We called you by mistake, but why did you say that you bought it?
        And even let us send it over! Our driver still remembers that it was you
        who took the goods, ah!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know any driver!” Li Baoguo entered the corridor, which was
        then followed by a ringing <em>clang</em> sound from when he entered the
        apartment and shut the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How can there someone be like this?!!” The young woman stood at the
        entrance of the corridor and wept out loud.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stood there and watched for about a minute, then slowly
        walked over to the two women, feeling as though there was a sandbag
        being dragged under his feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Excuse me,” he looked at the older woman, “Da-<em>jie</em>,<a
          href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >
        this… what’s going on?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you know that person?” This Da-<em>jie </em>immediately asked,
        pointing to Li Baoguo’s door, “Can you help us?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say that he knew Li Baoguo, but the Da-<em>jie</em>
        still told him the situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        They were two saleswomen from a tobacco and alcohol wholesale store, and
        an old customer had requested some cigarettes and liquor. The new girl
        accidentally called the wrong number and reached Li Baoguo, who asked
        for the goods to be sent to the intersection, but then he left without
        paying.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Normally, it’s alright for our older customers to pay after they have
        received the goods,” the Da-<em>jie </em>said. “But, in this case, we
        only realized this mistake when that customer called later in the
        evening to ask when it was going to be delivered.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s my fault,” the young woman said, crying. “But he can’t take things
        that aren’t his and then not admit it. Those things cost over 2000 yuan.
        If he doesn’t return them, then I have to compensate for the loss…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng only felt a chill overtake his entire body. After he turned
        his head to sneeze a few times, he felt his brain had swelled up – it
        felt uncomfortable everywhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Leave a number with me,” he said. “I’ll sort things out with him and
        contact you guys.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you know him?” That Da-<em>jie</em> quickly asked, “Who are you to
        him? Are you his son?”
      </p>

      <p>“… yes.” Jiang Cheng nodded with difficulty.</p>

      <p>
        “Then, you have to help this young lady, you’re both young people. She
        hasn’t even been working for two months yet, and her monthly wage isn’t
        even enough to compensate,” the Da-<em>jie </em>said. “Her family is
        having a pretty hard time as well. It’s not easy for her ah.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll contact you guys after I have sorted out the situation,” Jiang
        Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        The young woman kept crying while the Da-jie continued to plead with him
        repeatedly. Jiang Cheng didn’t know what else he could say, so he could
        only repeat the same sentence.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the two finally left, he opened the door and entered the place in
        exhaustion.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why did you bicker with them for so long?” Li Baoguo was standing in
        the living room, immediately shouting at him in displeasure the moment
        he saw him enter. “You don’t have to pay attention to them!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Did you take those things?” Jiang Cheng threw his schoolbag on the
        sofa.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo was still shouting: “It doesn’t matter whether I took them or
        not, this matter…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I asked if you took them!” Jiang Cheng cut him off and roared in rage.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I took them! So what!?! They’re the ones who called and wanted to send
        it over to me!” Li Baoguo glared at him and roared back, “What about
        it?! What does it have to do with me?! That’s their own mistake! They
        have to bear the consequences!”
      </p>

      <p>“Return them,” Jiang Cheng scowled at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Have you lost your mind? Why would you return something that came to
        you for free? It’s not like I took the initiative to trick them!” Li
        Baoguo had an expression that appeared as if he was looking at a fool,
        “Let me tell you, they’ve already checked the surveillance camera! Even
        went all the way to the police station! And guess what, the police
        didn’t give a shit! Let them figure it out themselves!”
      </p>

      <p>
        It would have been fine if Li Baoguo hadn’t said those words, but once
        he actually said them, Jiang Cheng felt he was about to blow his lid.
        “You’re quite proud, huh? Even the police can’t afford to offend a thug
        like you! You must be pretty happy, aren’t you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re spouting bullshit, watch your fucking mouth around Laozi!”<a
          href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >
        Li Baoguo’s anger also rose as he pointed at him. “Look clearly at who
        you’re talking to! You’re talking to your father!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng suppressed the anger in his heart and stared at him for a
        few seconds before he turned his head and walked into Li Baoguo’s room.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What are you doing?” Li Baoguo immediately followed and grabbed his
        arm, pulling him out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng turned around and violently shook off his arm: “I told you!
        Don’t touch me!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “So, what if I touch you!” Li Baoguo roared, “I fucking ejaculated you
        out. Don’t mention grabbing you, even if I beat the crap out of you, it
        won’t be your turn to talk bullshit!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s hands were shaking. He ignored him and bent down to look
        under his bed; there was a pile of rubbish but no cigarettes or liquors
        in sight. He then went to open the closet.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If Laozi doesn’t teach you a lesson today, then you won’t know who’s in
        charge of this family!” Li Baoguo rushed over and gave his back a hard
        shove.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng hadn’t expected that. The sudden shove slammed his face
        directly against the closet door – he felt a burst of pain on his nose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Immediately after, Li Baoguo punched him in the face: “You really think
        that you’re the young master of some family!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout his life, Jiang Cheng had been scolded by his parents, made
        to stand in punishment, and even made to kneel – he had been through it
        all. But this was the first time he was ever beaten by a ‘parental
        figure’.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo’s fist was considerably heavy, so heavy that he found it hard
        to believe that Li Baoguo was beaten to the ground to such a degree that
        day based on this fist alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything before him became blurry – Li Baoguo’s third move soon
        followed with a rough kick to his stomach.
      </p>

      <p>
        This kick brought Jiang Cheng directly to his knees. He was practically
        unable to utter a sound from the unbearable pain.
      </p>

      <p>Fuck, your, ancestors.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a></p>

      <p>
        As Li Baoguo kicked his shoulders, Jiang Cheng clenched his teeth and
        grabbed a stool from the side, swinging it severely at his lower leg.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo probably didn’t expect him to retaliate and even shouted
        angrily in pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng held his stomach and stood up. He grabbed the stool, swung
        it at his arms, and smashed it repeatedly on his body.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck you, son of a bitch.” Jiang Cheng glared at Li Baoguo through
        gritted teeth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Maybe Li Baoguo, who was only a coward when outside and became a tyrant
        when at home, had lost too much face from getting consecutively punched
        twice by him, thus, he rushed forward and launched a series of attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Jiang Cheng had struck him twice, he had no intention to keep
        going; even if this person wasn’t his father, he was still an older
        adult halfway to his grave, who was also coughing all day long… when Li
        Baoguo pounced over again, he only pushed him away.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Li Baoguo was riled up. If he didn’t teach him a lesson until he
        conceded, he probably wouldn’t stop. He didn’t appear to look like
        someone that possessed a coughing frenzy at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had to push him away again and again, from his room to the
        living room, until he finally bumped against the living room door.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You must want to kill me, huh!” Li Baoguo bellowed, “Come on! Come on!
        Come! Kill me!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t want to respond to him and only stared at him in
        silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Lao Li! What’s going on?” The voice of the neighbor next door sounded
        from the other side.
      </p>

      <p>
        “My son wants to kill me!” Li Baoguo shouted and reached back a hand to
        open the door. He rushed toward a few of the neighbors standing outside
        and yelled, “Everybody look, just look! My son wants to kill me!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why are you…” Jiang Cheng’s shock had already overwhelmed his anger, so
        much that his voice started to tremble a bit, “So shameless?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m shameless?” Li Baoguo turned to look at him, “I’m shameless? I have
        to raise you, provide you with food, water, and education! I just took a
        little advantage of something sent to me for free, and you call me
        shameless?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt so pissed that his breath was almost caught in his
        throat. He wanted to directly turn his back towards this person.
      </p>

      <p>“It hasn’t been easy for your dad…” an uncle standing outside said.</p>

      <p>“Shut the fuck up!” Jiang Cheng yelled.</p>

      <p>
        These neighbors, whose expressions were filled with the anticipation of
        watching a good show, could be seen at a glance that not a single one of
        them really held a hint of empathy. If they actually came to placate
        them, then they wanted nothing more but to catch sight of Li Baoguo’s
        spectacle.
      </p>

      <p>“Hey!” an aunt shouted loudly, “What’s wrong with this kid?!”</p>

      <p>
        “What?!” Li Baoguo suddenly shouted at her, “What’s wrong with my son!
        What does it have to do with you? Who are you to shoot your mouth off?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You psycho!” The aunt glared at him, stomped her feet, and cursed as
        she made her way up the stairs, “You’re a family of psychos! Even the
        pharmaceutical companies would shut down from how much drugs your family
        needs to take!”
      </p>

      <p>Li Baoguo swung the door shut.</p>

      <p>
        He turned to face Jiang Cheng, and after staring at him for a long
        while, he finally opened his mouth: “I’m going to die soon…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t talk to me.” Jiang Cheng suppressed his voice, “I’m already
        dead.”
      </p>

      <p>Li Baoguo reopened the door and walked out.</p>

      <p>“The things?” Jiang Cheng asked from behind him.</p>

      <p>“Sold them,” Li Baoguo said.</p>

      <p>“The money?” Jiang Cheng asked again.</p>

      <p>“Spent it all,” Li Baoguo answered.</p>

      <p>
        “From now on,” Jiang Cheng uttered. “You won’t have me as a son anymore!
        You never did, and you never will!”
      </p>

      <p>Li Baoguo stood still outside the door.</p>

      <p>
        “I’m moving out,” Jiang Cheng said. “You don’t have to raise me, provide
        me with food, water, nor education any longer.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo looked back, gave a cold laugh, and directly left without
        saying a word.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei sat behind the cash register playing on his phone while Li Yan
        leaned on the front of the counter and watched as Li Baoguo walked back
        and forth around the shelves.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This discounted item, has it expired?” he asked, pointing at several
        containers of yogurt in the freezer.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just about,” Gu Fei said. “There are still two or three days left
        before they expire.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo took a container and placed it on the checkout counter: “Check
        me out.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Li-<em>shu</em>,<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> you still eat yogurt?” Li Yan
        asked.
      </p>

      <p>“En, I never had it before,” Li Baoguo said. “I want to try it.”</p>

      <p>“Charge it to your account?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“I have cash.” Li Baoguo took out a bill.</p>

      <p>
        “You’ve been pretty lucky lately?” Gu Fei smiled and gave him some
        change after receiving the money.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Not bad, not bad,” Li Baoguo said and walked out carrying the yogurt.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Yan sat next to Gu Fei and watched as Li Baoguo left: “He’s really
        Jiang Cheng’s biological father?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei played on his phone.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck, the impact of this environment on people is tremendous,” Li Yan
        said, stretching out his body. “Just look at Li Baoguo, and that family
        of his… he actually has a son like Jiang Cheng.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How long are you planning to stay here?” Gu Fei didn’t go on with that
        conversation and continued to swipe his finger on his phone screen.
        “This weekend has been completely wasted in your hands, so annoying.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll go back whenever my mom gives up on making me go on blind dates,”
        Li Yan replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ugh.” Gu Fei threw his phone on the table, “Why don’t you just buy my
        shop?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Yan leaned back into his chair and laughed for a while: “Some friend
        you are!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Are you going to be here again tomorrow?” Gu Fei asked, “If you are,
        I’ll tell my mom she doesn’t need to come. You can just watch the shop
        and keep an eye on Er Miao along the way.”
      </p>

      <p>“En. No problem,” Li Yan said.</p>

      <p>
        “Also, help me get the goods?” Gu Fei glanced at him, “The place where I
        got the frozen dumplings last time, you’ve been there.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, leave it to me.” Li Yan sighed.</p>

      <p>
        Li Yan wasn’t old – he wasn’t even 23 years old. But because he never
        had a girlfriend before, he made his mother who wished to hold a
        grandson since he was 15 extremely anxious. This son of hers idled all
        day and could barely handle a regular job – at this point, she
        desperately wanted him to get married.
      </p>

      <p>Sometimes, Gu Fei felt helpless for Li Yan.</p>

      <p>
        This time, Li Yan was probably forced to his limit, so he simply turned
        off his phone and stayed here without returning home for the last two
        days.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t have any hearts left in his Craz3 Match game. Jiang Cheng
        had said that he would help him pass three levels, but he had only
        passed one. Since then, he hadn’t been able to pass the remaining two
        levels in the past two days.
      </p>

      <p>
        He sighed and quit the game, then opened his Moments and slowly browsed
        around.
      </p>

      <p>
        There wasn’t anything worthwhile. The girls were posting selfies with so
        much filter that their noses were missing, as well as the stuff that
        they bought, bought, bought, and the boys were just gaming and
        pretending to be cool.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng was simply a breath of fresh air amidst all that.</p>

      <p>Cheng-<em>ge</em>: I’m so rich.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at those words and laughed for a long time before he
        pressed like.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng hadn’t contacted him for the last two days. Although they
        weren’t in contact much on the weekends before either, after all,
        something that made them unable to look at each other straight in the
        eyes did happen just two days ago. But he was actually alright… he was
        just a bit worried about Jiang Cheng’s state of mind.
      </p>

      <p>But looking at this Moment, there didn’t appear to be any problems.</p>

      <p>
        It was only when he saw Jiang Cheng on Monday that he noticed his sallow
        complexion, however, his mood was considered normal.
      </p>

      <p>“Here.” Jiang Cheng handed him two sheets of folded paper.</p>

      <p>“The self-reflection papers?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng nodded, “There shouldn’t be any words that you can’t
        read.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed: “It’s not like a xuezha<sup>120</sup> is illiterate.”
      </p>

      <p>
        That day was the day that they all had to go on stage to read their
        self-reflection papers; Lao Xu gathered them to the side of the podium
        before the whole school assembled. The students from Class 5 didn’t
        come, leaving only the few of them to stand on the stage like a bunch of
        idiots before the flag was raised.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the flag was finally raised and the Principal and the teacher on
        duty that day had finished speaking, it was their turn to get on the
        stage. They felt a “it’s finally our turn to come out” sort of feeling.
      </p>

      <p>“Gu Fei, you’re first,” the Principal said.</p>

      <p>There was a round of applause in the audience below.</p>

      <p>
        “What is there to applaud for?” the teacher on duty yelled, “What is
        there to applaud for? Is a self-reflection paper something worthy of
        being applauded for? All of you be quiet!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei unfolded the paper that Jiang Cheng had given him and stood in
        front of the microphone.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Self-reflection paper,” Gu Fei spoke according to the shit-like words
        that Jiang Cheng wrote. “Teachers and fellow classmates, I am Jiang
        Cheng, from Second Year Class 8’s…”
      </p>

      <p>
        All the students standing slightly below them suddenly exploded into
        laughter after a brief second of silence, accompanied by countless
        shrieks. The Principal and the teacher on duty next to them both turned
        their heads towards him in utter shock.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Gu Fei suddenly swerved his head back to look at the row of
        people behind him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had lowered his head and was searching frantically in his
        pocket, and it was only after some time that he finally managed to find
        the two other folded pieces of papers and hurriedly handed them over to
        Gu Fei in only two steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        He gave the one in his hand to Jiang Cheng and muttered: “You’re too
        awesome. You can even mistakenly give something like this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re pretty awesome yourself,” Jiang Cheng also lowered his voice.
        “You don’t even know your own name?”
      </p>

      <p><em>***</em></p>

      <p>The translators have something to say:</p>

      <p>Sae: The amount of hate we have for Li Baoguo is over the roof!</p>

      <p>
        Ice: I spat a fishbone at him and was then unable to reenter the
        document for 10 minutes… it’s Li Baoguo’s revenge…!! The curse of the
        fishbone!! *angry ice cube noises*
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        Gu Fei took the self-reflection paper that Jiang Cheng had given him for
        the second time and unfolded it, and only after carefully determining
        that the name written above was ‘Gu Fei’ and not ‘Wang Xu’ or some other
        person, did he start to read it out loud once more: “I am Gu Fei, from
        Second Year Class 8’s. As a student of Si Zhong, I had uh… building…? …
        repeatedly violated the school’s what now… school rules. Being late is…
        is a uh… terrible mistake. Not only was I late, but I had also sat on
        the wall… uh, climbed. Climbed over the wall, which only added to… to my
        mistake…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had actually written the characters quite largely, but it
        was still hideous – earth-shatteringly hideous. Gu Fei read aloud with
        extreme difficulty as he listened to the low laughter that the audience
        would let out from time to time.
      </p>

      <p>
        “At this critical… moment where we only have half a semester left before
        we enter the Third Year,” Gu Fei peered at the paper, not knowing what
        was so important about entering the Third Year. “I promise to correct my
        mistakes, abide by the school rules, not to be late or leave early, and
        not… not climb over the walls or step on… tree branches…”
      </p>

      <p><em>What the hell is stepping on the tree branches?!</em></p>

      <p>
        When he reached the last line, he finally breathed a sigh of relief:
        “Self-reflecting person, Gu Fei.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go stand over there Gu Fei, next.” The teacher on duty swept a glance
        over the row of people lined up on the stage and chose his next target,
        “Jiang Cheng!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Another round of applause erupted from below, and the face of the
        teacher on duty turned green. He pointed at the students before them,
        “Who wants to come up and read one with them? I’ll give you an
        opportunity!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stood in front of the microphone, took out his
        self-reflection paper for a look, then flipped to the second page again
        and took a couple more glances. He then neatly folded the paper and
        placed it back in his pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I am Jiang Cheng, from Second Year Class 8.” He gazed down at the
        people below, “Last week, because of a small altercation, me and Class
        5’s…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at the audience in silence for two seconds, then
        looked back at the row of people behind him: “What was that person’s
        name again?”
      </p>

      <p>
        That question was certainly not asked in a low voice, and a wave of
        insuppressible laughter to instantly burst out from students below.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck?” Wang Xu was dumbstruck, he then hurriedly told him, “Luo Yi!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Class 5’s Classmate Luo Yi and I had a fight.” Jiang Cheng very calmly
        turned back his head and continued to speak, “This kind of behavior is a
        serious violation of school regulations and is not conducive to the
        unity between classmates and our classes. As the person to first
        initiate the fight, I did not give Classmate Luo Yi the opportunity to
        explain and apologize to me. This has also caused conflicts between the
        two classes and unfavorable consequences. In the past few days, I have
        deeply reflected on my impulsive behavior. Fighting cannot solve the
        problem…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at Jiang Cheng’s back, Gu Fei was hit by a profound feeling of
        utmost admiration toward this unconventionally handsome xueba who would
        memorize even a self-reflection, and also not pass on such a chance to
        show off. For this reflection, he didn’t just do something as simple as
        admitting his mistakes, he had completely placed all the blame regarding
        this matter on Luo Yi’s head.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, after listening to Jiang Cheng’s self-reflection, Gu Fei
        understood the reason why he looked unwell earlier this morning. Jiang
        Cheng seemed to have a cold thus spoke with a nasal tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Wang Xu whispered to him from the side, “What the hell is this
        kid, Jiang Cheng, trying to do? He’s even more capable of stealing the
        limelight than I am. This sort of thing can actually be used to show
        off…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You can only give in.” Guo Xu lowered his head, “Take this
        self-reflection paper for example, let’s not even talk about how well it
        might be written, I can’t even memorize it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I will reflect seriously, correct my mistakes, unite with my
        classmates, and stop being impulsive…” Jiang Cheng had read the
        reflection aloud without stuttering even once throughout the entire
        process. “Self-reflecting person, Jiang Cheng.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Then he bowed, turned around, and returned to stand in the middle of the
        row of dumbfounded people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next to go up was Wang Xu. He took out a self-reflection paper that had
        crumpled into a ball from his pocket and read it out loud with great
        enthusiasm: “Teachers and fellow classmates, good morning! In these warm
        spring days where flowers bloom and Spring returns to the Earth! I have
        made a mistake…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei sighed. He was almost unable to hold back the need to laugh, so
        he quickly lowered his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Those that don’t know would think that his mistake has something to do
        with Spring…” Jiang Cheng whispered.
      </p>

      <p>
        The row of people all suddenly lowered their heads and laughed until
        their entire bodies shook.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Principal cleared his throat from behind them – only then did the
        group manage to restrain their laughter with difficulty.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You actually memorized your self-reflection paper?” Gu Fei tilted his
        head and shot a glance at Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No,” Jiang Cheng answered in a low voice, “I didn’t expect the two of
        us to read it one after the other. Those two self-reflection papers
        consisted of the same admittance, mistakes, and whatnot. If they were
        read together, it would be too obvious…”
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck,” Guo Xu was a little shocked. “So you improvised then?”</p>

      <p>“That’s called going off-script,” Jiang Cheng corrected him.</p>

      <p>“… oh.” Guo Xu still had a dumbstruck expression.</p>

      <p>
        Once Class 8 finished reading their self-reflection papers, it was Class
        5’s turns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each and every one of them was a stuttering mess and took a lot of time
        to finish their readings. In the end, the Principal and the teacher on
        duty didn’t even bother to give a conclusion anymore and just directly
        announced their dismissal.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once they returned to class, everyone rushed forward to congratulate
        Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You really will be well-known by the whole school at this point.” Zhou
        Jing gave him a thumbs up, “Jiang Cheng, you’re really…”
      </p>

      <p>“Shut up,” Jiang Cheng said and turned his head away to sneeze.</p>

      <p>“You have a cold?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>“Yeah.” Jiang Cheng nodded and put on his face mask.</p>

      <p>
        Perhaps, it had suddenly occurred to them that the cause for the cold
        might be because they were covered with only a thin blanket in a room
        with an extinguished fire and an open window that night…
      </p>

      <p>Both ended the conversation, feeling a bit awkward.</p>

      <p>
        After class started, Gu Fei finally asked: “Didn’t I tell you to wait
        for me so that we can come to school together?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… I forgot.” Jiang Cheng laid his body on the table with his eyes
        half-closed.
      </p>

      <p>“Then let’s go back together.” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng answered.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t speak anymore, guessing that Jiang Cheng was feeling quite
        uncomfortable by his appearance. He lowered his head and continued to
        play on his phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the end of class, he put down his phone and glanced over at Jiang
        Cheng who was still laying on the table with his mask covering his face
        – he appeared to be in a deep sleep.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei,” Lao Xu called when he passed by the door of their classroom
        after his lesson ended in the class next door. “Come here for a bit.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei looked at Lao Xu and remained seated without moving.</p>

      <p>
        “I have something to discuss with you.” Lao Xu waved his hand, “Come
        here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei reluctantly collected his phone and very slowly walked out of the
        classroom, trudging behind Lao Xu.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Lao Xu walked down the stairs and went toward the staff’s bathroom,
        Gu Fei stopped. “Do you want to talk first before going to the
        bathroom?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t need to use the bathroom,” Lao Xu said. “There’s just less
        people here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        With an expression of “this is a secret matter” riding on Lao Xu’s face,
        Gu Fei had to follow him. He sat down on a stone bench next to the
        bathroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I have something to ask, but this matter must be kept secret,” Lao Xu
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If it has nothing to do with me then don’t say it. I don’t want to get
        involved in other people’s business or keep secrets for anyone.” Gu Fei
        felt for a cigarette from his pocket out of habit but glanced at Lao Xu
        and stopped himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Smoke, smoke, just don’t let the Director of Academics catch sight of
        it, otherwise, I’ll also have to write a self-reflection paper too.” Lao
        Xu sighed and watched as he lit a cigarette before he continued to
        speak. “This matter has nothing to do with you, but it has to do with
        Jiang Cheng. I noticed that the two of you have a pretty good
        relationship… so I wanted to talk to you about it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei lowered his head and held the cigarette in his mouth. After a
        moment, he finally asked: “What do you want to talk about?”
      </p>

      <p>“Did you know that Jiang Cheng has left home?” Lao Xu asked.</p>

      <p>“Huh?” Gu Fei looked up in shock.</p>

      <p>
        “Ah, even you didn’t know about this?” Lao Xu gave a heavy sigh, “His
        father came to find me.”
      </p>

      <p>“Li Baoguo?” Gu Fei asked, “He came to the school?”</p>

      <p>
        “No, he called.” Lao Xu explained, “He knew me from before. His older
        son Li Hui was also my student.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Gu Fei sounded in response.</p>

      <p><em>He left home?</em></p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu continued in a low voice: “Lao Li didn’t say why Jiang Cheng ran
        off. He only mentioned that they had a disagreement, and that Jiang
        Cheng was angry at him…”
      </p>

      <p>“That person’s words can’t be trusted,” Gu Fei muttered.</p>

      <p>
        “That’s why I wanted to ask you. If I look for Jiang Cheng directly, he
        definitely wouldn’t tell me a thing with his temper.” Lao Xu’s face was
        pressed with worry, “Such an outstanding kid, if these matters aren’t
        handled well, they will affect his studies.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know. He didn’t mention anything about it to me,” Gu Fei said.
        But Lao Xu only looked at him with an expression of disbelief. He put
        out the cigarette, “It doesn’t matter if you don’t believe me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright. <em>Ai</em>.” Lao Xu shook his head, “You don’t have to ask
        him anything. I’ll talk to Lao Li once more to see what’s going on. The
        midterms are tomorrow, let’s talk about this again once it’s over.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t say anything else. He stood up and returned to the
        classroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was listless all morning. After he went to the infirmary to
        grab some cold medicine, he immediately plopped down on his desk and
        fell into a deep sleep. He slept all the way until class ended at noon.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei had to push him several times before he woke up: “Hey, class is
        over now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Jiang Cheng opened his eyes and spoke with a muffled tone. “I’m
        not going back this noon. You can just… go back by yourself.”
      </p>

      <p>“You’re not going to eat anything either?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t have any appetite, so no to eating.” Jiang Cheng closed his
        eyes again.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay.” Gu Fei kept silent and walked out of the classroom whilst
        playing on his phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        But when he walked out of the school gate, he immediately caught sight
        of a few people squatting across the street. There was a motorcycle
        beside them, and on it sat Jiang Bin.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei ignored them and texted Jiang Cheng as he walked.</p>

      <p>– Jiang Bin is outside, don’t come out.</p>

      <p>
        But then before pressing send, he changed “Jiang Bin” to “Boar Head”.
        Jiang Cheng was already a complete mess when it came to remembering
        people’s names, and since he had a cold, he probably wouldn’t remember
        who Jiang Bin was.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng actually replied rather quickly.</p>

      <p>– Is he causing you trouble?</p>

      <p>– No.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng didn’t respond, he probably fell asleep again.</p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei straddled his bicycle, Jiang Bin started his motorcycle and
        drove over to block him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu and the others had also gotten on their bikes. But as soon as
        they turned back their heads and saw them, they immediately stopped and
        stared in their direction.
      </p>

      <p>“You free?” Jiang Bin asked.</p>

      <p>“Do you need something?” Gu Fei’s feet landed on the ground.</p>

      <p>
        “It’s been a long since we played ball together.” Jiang Bin said. “Do
        you want to play a game sometime?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s talk about it another time,” Gu Fei responded. “we have to take
        our exams tomorrow.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Yo</em>.” Jiang Bin had on an exaggerated expression of surprise,
        “The <em>famous</em> Gu Fei wants to take an exam?”
      </p>

      <p>A wave of laughter followed after.</p>

      <p>“Let’s talk after exams are over.” Gu Fei ignored his laughter.</p>

      <p>
        “Alright.” Jiang Bin pointed at him, “I’m giving you face. I’ll come
        find you after the exams.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei made a sound in response.</p>

      <p>“Get the guy called Jiang Cheng to come along too,” Jiang Bin said.</p>

      <p>“I can’t promise you that,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Jiang Bin spat on the ground, “I said,
        <em>bring him</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t cross me.” Gu Fei shot him a dirty look and slowly enunciated
        every word, “If you want to cross me, then get your older brother<a
          href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
        to come with you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei,” Jiang Bin twisted the motorcycle throttle. “I’m not my
        brother, I’m not on friendly terms with you like he is…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m not on friendly terms with your brother,” Gu Fei interrupted him.
        “If you want to play a game, we can arrange a time after exams. But if
        you want to arrange a meeting with Jiang Cheng, call your brother.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After he said that, Gu Fei stepped on his pedal and squeezed his way
        past him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu and several others immediately followed up on their bicycles:
        “What’s going on? Is he looking for trouble?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What does it have to do with you?” Gu Fei said. “If you want to look
        for trouble, then go back and look for him now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Wang Xu became angry, “This was caused by the game! It has to do
        with our entire team! This is a collective…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go use that collective sense of honor somewhere else.” Gu Fei stepped
        hard on the pedal and the bicycle flew ahead, “Just go back.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Once he arrived at the shop, Gu Miao, who was skateboarding at the door,
        flew past him without giving him a second glance when she saw him come
        back.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei discovered that this little girl seemed to have grown; her height
        that hadn’t changed at all for a year had finally shown some changes –
        her head seemed to reach his waist now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Yan was in the shop, as was Liu Fan, presumably called over by Li Yan
        after he had gotten too bored. The two were cooking some noodles at the
        moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before he had a chance to speak, he suddenly heard Li Baoguo’s voice:
        “Da Fei, you’re out of school?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Li-<em>shu</em>.” Gu Fei was a bit surprised to see Li Baoguo standing
        near the shelves, “Did you come to buy something?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “He wants to ask you about Jiang Cheng,” Li Yan piped in from the side.
        “Said that he left home.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was a little speechless. He had asked about Jiang Cheng until
        even Li Yan and the others knew about their situation. If Jiang Cheng
        were to hear that Li Baoguo had told so many people that he ran away
        from home at such a grand scale<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a>, he probably
        wouldn’t go back no matter how much he was asked.
      </p>

      <p>“Did he go to school today?” Li Baoguo asked in a loud voice.</p>

      <p>“I don’t know,” Gu Fei said. “I didn’t go to school today.”</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t help him hide from me!” Li Baoguo said with great
        dissatisfaction, “You bunch of undisciplined delinquents are all
        covering up for each other!”
      </p>

      <p>“I really didn’t go to school,” Gu Fei said once more.</p>

      <p>
        “That little bastard! Every single one of the assholes that grew up in
        the big cities all have fucking short tempers! The people over there
        have spoiled him! He was spouting shit like he can’t be touched!” Li
        Baoguo complained, “If you’re wrong, can’t your father educate you?!
        Running off just from a few words! He doesn’t even recognize his father
        anymore! If it weren’t for me, his father… he wouldn’t even exist!”
      </p>

      <p>“When did he run off?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “He probably ran off after getting stubborn with me on Friday!” Li
        Baoguo’s face was engulfed with fury, “I just went out to play some
        cards and when I came back, all his things were gone! He sure has guts!
        If I wasn’t stopped by your Xu Laoshi when I went to the school, just
        see whether or not his legs would’ve been broken off or not!”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t utter another word.</p>

      <p>
        Li Baoguo stood in the shop yelling while screaming obscenities, then
        walked out with a stream of curses.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the fuck.” Liu Fan sat at the table to the side, “This person is
        amazing. If my father went everywhere cursing like this, I would never
        go back home in this life.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Isn’t Li Hui no longer returning home now?” Gu Fei also sat down. “Oh
        right, I’m going to have a ball game in a few days after exams are
        over.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ball game? Your school’s?” Li Yan asked, “Do you guys also want to pull
        in some external help?”
      </p>

      <p>“No,” Gu Fei said. “Jiang Bin asked.”</p>

      <p>
        Liu Fan started to laugh then leaned back into his chair and continued
        to laugh for a while. “Shitty bastard, he actually has the face to give
        a declaration of war?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then just play <em>bei</em>,” Li Yan looked indifferent. “It wasn’t
        easy to win against them this once anyways, just let him retain a bit of
        face since he lost.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “He also specifically mentioned for Jiang Cheng to come as well,” Gu Fei
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Yan froze: “Then he definitely doesn’t intend on just playing ball
        <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>“Are you going to shoulder everything in his place?” Li Yan asked.</p>

      <p>
        “What do you mean by ‘shoulder’ everything?” Gu Fei said. “Jiang Bin has
        also counted me in.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then we’ll just go together <em>bei</em>.” Liu Fan stretched his body,
        “It’s been a long time since I’ve been active…”
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei arrived at the classroom that afternoon, Jiang Cheng was
        still wearing a mask and lying half-dead on the desk, listlessly playing
        on his phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he sat down, Jiang Cheng looked up in surprise: “I thought you
        wouldn’t come.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nowhere to go,” Gu Fei said and sized him up, “Do you want to take a
        drip<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> or something for your cold?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s no need,” Jiang Cheng said. “It’s not that serious, I’m just
        tired since I didn’t sleep well.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Gu Fei didn’t know what else to say. He wanted to say, ‘Li Baoguo
        came to find me’, but then felt that it was inappropriate to say that
        now. After a long silence, he decided to remain taciturn.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although the afternoon self-study classes were all canceled, the
        teachers from the various subjects had vied with each other to occupy
        those periods, initiating a final battle with the sole intention of
        using the period to highlight the key concepts of their respective
        lessons for the impending exams.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was tired of listening to the lessons and was even more tired of
        listening to the key points. He put in his earbuds, listened to music,
        and started to play on his phone – sneaking glances left and right.
      </p>

      <p>
        The matter of them mispronouncing their names from when they read their
        self-reflections earlier that day had been posted on the forum and was
        already a hot topic – it was even pinned to the top as a hot read from
        all the likes.
      </p>

      <p>
        《Li Tao,<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> Has my OTP just been confirmed as
        canon by their real-life counterparts?》
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei clicked into the post and skimmed through it; the comments
        section was bustling with various images, memes, finger hearts, and
        everyone exploding on the spot with exclamation marks pasted above their
        heads. It was so ridiculous that even he wanted to laugh. He couldn’t
        tell who was who either, and just guessed that there were people from
        the school’s journalism club. They were snapping pictures everywhere
        with their cameras during the game.
      </p>

      <p>
        He also caught sight of an account that he suspected to be Wang Xu. It
        was probably a side account that he had recently created – it was called
        ‘<em>CaptainXu</em>’.<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> He could guess by the name
        alone that he had probably poured a lot of effort into searching through
        a Chinese-English dictionary before he finally discovered this word…

      <p>
        Just five seconds before the school bell would ring, the math teacher
        rushed into the classroom: “I have a worksheet<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a>
        here…”
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a prolonged protest in the classroom, and many of the students
        just rushed out without hearing what the teacher was about to say.
      </p>

      <p>“Leaving?” Gu Fei asked Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng stood up and went to get the worksheet from the math
        teacher.
      </p>

      <p>“What a model student.” Gu Fei also went over and took one.</p>

      <p>“What are you taking this for?” The math teacher stared at him.</p>

      <p>
        “You’ve already brought it out,” Gu Fei folded the worksheet and stuffed
        it in his pocket.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng got downstairs, he first went to the sink to wash his
        face, then switched to another face mask: “Do you… have time?”
      </p>

      <p>“What’s wrong?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “The shop you mentioned that sold bicycles,” Jiang Cheng said. “Take me
        there. I’m too lazy to walk and my nose has been blocked all day, it’s
        so freaking uncomfortable.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Bin wasn’t there to block them at the school gate, nor was Hou Zi,
        but Gu Fei knew very well that Hou Zi would definitely intervene in this
        matter. Although he didn’t have a good relationship with this younger
        cousin of his, he was the boss of this area after all. Unlike Wang Xu,
        who struggled on the path of a pseudo-class tyrant, his pride greatly
        exceeded the sky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides, Hou Zi had found him an eyesore for a long time. Every time he
        had said that he was just giving him face, but who knew how large the
        fire in his heart had already become. This matter would have happened
        sooner or later, with or without Jiang Bin.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was just that if this matter was really going to get Jiang Cheng
        involved, he really couldn’t agree to it – Jiang Cheng was different
        from all of them. Take the fact that he completed the self-reflections
        as an example; he wasn’t someone who should’ve been dragged here and
        made to stay in a place like this, much less stay only to be inflicted
        with trouble.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>, I forgot to ask you.” Jiang Cheng sat at the back of his
        bicycle, “Are the bikes in that shop expensive? I can only afford
        something that’s less than 500 RMB.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hey, city boy.” Gu Fei tilted his head over, “The most expensive bike
        in their shop probably doesn’t even exceed 350 RMB.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh,” Jiang Cheng responded and clicked his tongue after a while.
        “Then it must be extremely ugly.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei squeezed the brakes and held the handlebar with one hand as he
        twisted half of his body back to stare at him.
      </p>

      <p>“I’m…. just saying,” Jiang Cheng laughed.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng actually wasn’t picky about the bike at all, nor did he
        choose the most expensive one in the shop that was 400 RMB. Instead, he
        chose one that costs 250<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> RMB and asked for the
        price to be dropped to 220 RMB on the grounds that 250 RMB just sounded
        like too horrible of a number.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei felt that Jiang Cheng probably had no intention of returning to
        Li Baoguo’s place, so his current budget was even tighter than before.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is it okay?” Gu Fei watched him ride it back and forth on the sidewalk.
      </p>

      <p>“Yeah,” Jiang Cheng nodded. “It’s just really ugly.”</p>

      <p>“Pay up and leave,” Gu Fei said helplessly.</p>

      <p>
        After Jiang Cheng paid the money, the two of them slowly pedaled in the
        direction leading back home.
      </p>

      <p>
        As they approached the intersection, Jiang Cheng turned his head toward
        him as if he had made up his mind: “I don’t live at Li Baoguo’s place
        anymore.”
      </p>

      <p>“Why?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know how to explain it,” Jiang Cheng sighed. “I’ll head over to
        your shop in a bit to buy some things.”
      </p>

      <p>“Daily necessities?” Gu Fei looked at him, “Where do you live now?”</p>

      <p>
        “It’s not far,” Jiang Cheng said. “I enquired the boss of the inn where
        I stayed last time. It’s at the intersection past the street by your
        place…”
      </p>

      <p>“The towel factory dormitory?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t know. The building is about as broken as Li Baoguo’s place.
        There’s one-bedroom, and the rent is cheap,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>“What are you planning to do in the future?” Gu Fei asked again.</p>

      <p>
        “I don’t have any plans.” Jiang Cheng turned his head to sneeze and
        sniffed his nose. “In any case, I won’t be going back. I’m no one’s son.
        From now on, I’m a fucking orphan.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t say anything.</p>

      <p>
        After the two rode forward for a while in silence, Gu Fei said: “Orphan,
        I’ll invite you to a meal.”
      </p>

      <p>“Alright <em>ah</em>,” Jiang Cheng laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “Let’s go eat near the towel factory dormitory,” Gu Fei said. “I’ll also
        tell you where you should go to buy things around there along the way.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay,” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei turned his face to look at him, he pulled up his mask, and
        quickly turned his head away.

      <p>
        Gu Fei rode to the front, keeping a distance from him at an unhurried
        pace. Jiang Cheng sometimes felt that Gu Fei’s keen observation ability
        and high EQ that prevented him from being too inquisitive about other
        people’s matters really irked him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He pulled the mask up so that the edge could catch the tears that slid
        down.
      </p>

      <p>
        The distance from where they were to Gu Fei’s shop was considerably
        decent, taking only about ten minutes on the bicycle, which was enough.
        He just followed behind Gu Fei like this, letting his tears flow out as
        much as he wanted.
      </p>

      <p>He honestly didn’t know why he suddenly burst in tears.</p>

      <p>
        He didn’t feel like he had the <em>urge</em> to cry at all, and there
        wasn’t anything that made him <em>want</em> to cry either. Even if he no
        longer had a home, no longer had parents… this kind of mindset wasn’t
        something that had only existed for a day or two. From the day he was
        told that he was adopted, he already realized that he would never have a
        home again.
      </p>

      <p>
        After coming here, this feeling became clearer day by day… so why would
        he suddenly start crying after saying that he was an orphan?
      </p>

      <p>Sure enough, people are delicate when they are sick.</p>

      <p>
        By the time they arrived at the intersection, he had already stopped
        crying, and his tears were practically air-dried, leaving only his eyes
        to feel a little swollen.
      </p>

      <p>
        After they parked their bicycles at the door of Gu Fei’s shop, Gu Fei
        glanced back at him and quietly exclaimed as if he had seen something
        frightening: “<em>Aiyo</em>!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What’s wrong?” Jiang Cheng asked as he leaned the bicycle against the
        wall.
      </p>

      <p>“I…” Gu Fei hesitated. “I didn’t expect you to cry to this point.”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng suddenly wanted to laugh. Even Gu Fei, who was so adept at
        easing the embarrassment of others, couldn’t keep pretending not to have
        noticed anything any longer. He rubbed his eyes and asked: “Is it that
        red?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “They’re pretty red,” Gu Fei said. “Why don’t you wait for me here. I’ll
        help you bring out whatever you need. Li Yan is in there, you know.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s okay.” Jiang Cheng felt around in his schoolbag, pulled out a
        glasses case, took out and put on a pair of sunglasses. “I am equipped.”
      </p>

      <p>“You look…” Gu Fei stared at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Pretty handsome, right?” Jiang Cheng looked toward the window of the
        nearby community hospital, “Every time I pass by a display window, I’d
        always be taken aback by my handsomeness.”
      </p>

      <p>“Yes.” Gu Fei nodded, “You truly are… very handsome.”</p>

      <p>
        When the two of them walked into the shop together, Li Yan was in the
        middle of two shelves with Gu Miao’s skateboard under his feet, having
        difficulty with moving it forward. Gu Miao was leaning against the
        checkout counter with her arms folded as she watched on with a face of
        indifference.
      </p>

      <p>
        When she caught sight of them coming in, she rushed over to Jiang
        Cheng’s side and looked up at the sunglasses on his face with keen
        interest.
      </p>

      <p>“You’re already bored to this degree…” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “I’m just exercising my body,” Li Yan scanned Jiang Cheng once over.
        “Oh, I thought that someone had come to collect protection fees.”
      </p>

      <p>“Hand me the money,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>“They’re in the drawer,” Li Yan pointed at the checkout counter.</p>

      <p>“When are you heading back?” Gu Fei asked Li Yan.</p>

      <p>
        “You don’t have to worry about me.” Li Yan continued to move forward on
        the skateboard gruelingly. “I’ve made plans to eat with Liu Fan in a
        bit. You two wanna come?”
      </p>

      <p>“I won’t go,” Jiang Cheng remarked.</p>

      <p>
        “Can’t.” Gu Fei pulled Li Yan off of the skateboard, “We have midterm
        exams tomorrow.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What do the midterm exams have to do with you?” Li Yan asked, “He’s a
        xueba, so it’s only natural that he wants to study, but you’re the king
        of blank exam papers…”
      </p>

      <p>“I’ve never turned in a blank sheet before,” Gu Fei corrected him.</p>

      <p>
        “<em>Oh, right</em>, you’d always fill something in.” Li Yan nodded his
        head understandingly.
      </p>

      <p>“Yeah.” Gu Fei also nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “Alright then, if you guys can’t go, then you can’t go.” Li Yan picked
        up his jacket, “I’m heading out.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng roamed around the shelves twice and picked out some daily
        necessities and food. Gu Miao followed beside him curiously the entire
        time, staring intently at his sunglasses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, he had no choice but to take off the sunglasses. It had been
        quite a while, so his eyes shouldn’t be that red anymore. He placed the
        sunglasses on Gu Miao’s face.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao pushed the glasses up – expressionlessly.</p>

      <p>
        “Very cool.” Jiang Cheng gave her a thumbs up, “You will definitely be
        much cooler than your brother when you grow up, and very handsome too.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao didn’t speak, just turned around, grabbed her skateboard, and
        walked out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>!” Gu Fei shouted, “Take off the sunglasses! They’ll break
        if they fall to the ground!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao ignored him and confidently slid out wearing the sunglasses.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s fine,” Jiang Cheng said. “If they break, they break. I’ve been
        wearing them for a long time anyway.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Geez, you were only willing to buy a bike for 200 RMB just a moment
        ago.” Gu Fei leaned against the checkout counter and shot him a glance,
        “If the sunglasses actually break, you won’t be able to afford another
        pair.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “If they break, then shouldn’t <em>you</em> be the one to compensate?”
        Jiang Cheng laughed.
      </p>

      <p>“Oh, that’s right.” Gu Fei thought about it, “Yeah.”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng placed the goods that he had picked out on the counter,
        “Checkout.”
      </p>

      <p>“Then…” Gu Fei was a bit hesitant.</p>

      <p>“No,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed. He walked behind the checkout counter and started to
        scan the barcodes one by one, then put everything in a bag. “It’s a
        total of 123.2 RMB. I’ll just take out the small change, it’s 120 RMB.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay,” Jiang Cheng handed him the money.</p>

      <p>
        With no one watching the shop, Gu Fei had Gu Miao return home by herself
        and closed up the shop.
      </p>

      <p>“Have I delayed your business?” Jiang Cheng felt a bit embarrassed.</p>

      <p>
        “There’s not much business around mealtimes, and the only people that
        come around at this time are those who realized they’ve run out of salt
        or oil while cooking.” Gu Fei said nonchalantly as he straddled his
        bicycle and rode out.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng also got on his bicycle and followed suit.</p>

      <p>“I’ll give you the sunglasses tomorrow,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “No worries. I can see that Gu Miao really likes them,” Jiang Cheng.
        “Just let her have them to play with, but don’t forget to tell her not
        to wear it all the time. They’re bad for children’s eyes if they wear
        them too much.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei laughed.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wasn’t very familiar with this area. After the landlord told
        him the address that day, he had spent nearly half the day before he
        eventually found the place. Now that he was coming back that day, when
        he looked at the rows of dilapidated buildings that all looked the same…
        he literally couldn’t find where the building he had rented was.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No, I,” he was utterly dismal. “I remember entering at a certain
        intersection, and there were several buildings that all looked pretty
        much the same…”
      </p>

      <p>“Which certain intersection?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I…” Jiang Cheng froze for a while before finally pulling out his phone,
        “I’ll just ask the landlord again.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The landlord was very amused and told him the address one more time:
        “Young man, don’t come back in the middle of the night <em>ah</em>. I
        would’ve already locked up by then, so if you get lost, you’ll have to
        spend the night outside.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was quite familiar with this address. He stepped on his pedal and
        moved forward: “This way.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How come I have no recollection of it being this far?” Jiang Cheng
        asked, a little perplexed.
      </p>

      <p>“You don’t even remember the name,” Gu Fei countered.</p>

      <p>
        “It’s not that I can’t remember,” Jiang Cheng sighed. “I’m just too lazy
        to remember. My mind is not a garbage dump, of course, I have to
        remember useful things.”
      </p>

      <p>“Yeah, there is no use in remembering the road,” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>“Shut up,” Jiang Cheng retorted.</p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei took him to find the building where he had rented a place,
        he carefully looked around at his surroundings: “Alright, I’ve
        remembered it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s go eat after you finish putting the stuff away <em>ba</em>,” Gu
        Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng took him upstairs. This apartment of the landlord was
        on the second floor, and although it was very run-down, the inside of
        the apartment was okay. The furnishings were quite complete, and even if
        they were considered old, they were quite clean. Also, there weren’t any
        rats or cockroaches freely roaming about like at Li Baoguo’s place at
        the very least.
      </p>

      <p>“It’s not bad.” Gu Fei stood in the living room and looked around.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng put the things on the table, “I’ll go get a network
        cable in two days, and that’ll be just about it… oh, by the way, do you
        know where I can buy some bedding?”
      </p>

      <p>“Bedding?” Gu Fei froze.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t know why, but when he said those two syllables, his
        thoughts went inexplicably elsewhere. Judging from Gu Fei’s reaction, he
        was probably about the same.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two exchanged a glance, and Gu Fei was the first to laugh: “Oh,
        bedding <em>ah</em>. I do know.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything. He suddenly felt like it was impossible
        to stop himself from laughing, so he leaned out the window and laughed
        his head off until even his cheeks ached.
      </p>

      <p>“Damn,” Gu Fei rubbed at his face.</p>

      <p>
        “Let’s go buy some after we grab a bite? I don’t have enough time to buy
        it online,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright, we have to buy some first before we eat then.” Gu Fei took out
        his phone and checked the time, “There’s a fabric market for bedsheets
        and other products nearby. There are finished goods for sale too –
        quilts, pillows, and all that stuff are all available there. But it
        closes at around seven or eight o’clock.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay,” Jiang Cheng nodded his head.</p>

      <p>“Then…” Gu Fei pointed at the door, “Let’s go?”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything and just stood in a daze for a moment
        yet again before he went to stand in front of Gu Fei – wrapping his arms
        around his shoulders, he hugged him tightly.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei froze at first, but then lightly patted him on the back: “What’s
        wrong?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nothing.” Jiang Cheng still hugged him tightly, “Have you ever had a
        time where you felt particularly unstable, like you can’t exactly place
        your feet on the ground, but can’t fall either? Like you can’t grasp
        onto anything, and there is nothing beneath your feet.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei fell silent for a long time: “I have.”</p>

      <p>
        “I also think that you have,” Jiang Cheng said. “I step into a void, as
        if I’m about to fly… above me is confusion, and below me, I hear you say
        ‘this world is empty’…”
      </p>

      <p>
        The latter end of the sentence was sung by Jiang Cheng in a very low
        voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was astonished. Not only was he taken aback by the fact that
        Jiang Cheng had memorized the melody and lyrics after hearing it only
        once, but he was also pleasantly surprised by his voice when he sang.
        His voice was low and hoarse, carrying a certain seductive quality – it
        was euphonious.
      </p>

      <p>
        He could empathize with Jiang Cheng’s feelings of being utterly empty.
        Even though their experiences weren’t similar in the slightest, he could
        understand the panicked state of being unable to step on firm ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two stood quietly in the room. For the longest time, he could only
        hear Jiang Cheng’s repressed, low, and almost imperceptible cry echoing
        in his ears.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>,” Gu Fei softly whispered as he lightly patted his
        waist. “To tell you the truth, I’m not very good at comforting others.
        The only person that I’ve ever comforted is Er Miao… I just want to say
        that if you cry, it’s more satisfying to cry out loud.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Beside his ear, Jiang Cheng fell quiet for a moment. But after coughing
        twice, he abruptly started to sob.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was the kind of cry that was overflowed with reluctance, with fury,
        helplessness, and grievance.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was probably very cathartic from the sounds of it; from the wail that
        started it all off to the venting screams he let out as he grasped
        tightly on the fabric over his shoulders.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You bastard,” Jiang Cheng rasped, his voice wrapped with a sobbing
        tone.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah,” Gu Fei responded, still gently patting him. Then, he turned his
        head and pressed a kiss to the tip of Jiang Cheng’s ear.
      </p>

      <p>
        This action was beyond his expectations. He couldn’t clearly explain why
        he had done that, but Jiang Cheng didn’t give him time to ruminate on it
        – he turned his head and kissed him on the lips.
      </p>

      <p>
        The tongue that carried the slightly salty taste of tears roughly thrust
        into his mouth as if looking for a fight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was a little unprepared. He was hit by his somewhat savage frame
        until he retreated a step, yet Jiang Cheng still used his bounteous
        strength to push him back.
      </p>

      <p>
        He crashed into the wall behind him, and Jiang Cheng kissed him again.
      </p>

      <p>
        This kiss was just as uncontrollable as the kiss from the day Jiang
        Cheng got high from drinking, but compared to that day, he was much more
        sober now. After all, he didn’t drink fake liquor, so wherever the tip
        of his tongue occupied, it seemed like a declaration of war.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >I want to be here! I want to be there! I want this here! I want that
          there!</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >I’ve already stroked around here! Here, here, and there… are all
          mine!</em
        ><em></em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei initially had no intention of doing anything, but now under his
        almost insane plundering, he suddenly thought of Captain Wang Jiuri’s
        self-reflection paper.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >In these warm spring days where flowers bloom and Spring returns to
          the Earth… </em
        ><em></em>
      </p>

      <p>
        He grabbed Jiang Cheng by the arm and flung him onto the sofa next to
        them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was thrown heavily on the sofa by him. When he pressed down
        on him, he very naturally lifted Jiang Cheng’s shirt with ease and
        harshly caressed his body a few times.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng’s breath stopped. He grabbed at him through his pants.</p>

      <p>
        “Shit,” Gu Fei rasped in a suppressed voice. “If you grab any fucking
        harder, it’ll become useless.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng smirked and resolutely snaked his hand inside.</p>

      <p>
        Once the room was quiet again, Gu Fei could hear the laughter and shouts
        of the children running wild after eating.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Why don’t you guess,” Jiang Cheng was lying on the sofa with one leg on
        the floor. “How long will it take before you end up pushing me to the
        floor?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m not entirely on the sofa either <em>ah</em>.” Gu Fei had half his
        body on Jiang Cheng’s and one leg pressing against the coffee table. “In
        this posture, I would fall right down if I loosen my leg.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng glanced at his leg and burst into a laughing frenzy.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t laugh with him. But when he propped himself up with his
        arm, he raised a hand to gently rub the corner of his eye.
      </p>

      <p>“I’m fine now.” Jiang Cheng flicked his hand.</p>

      <p>
        “If you want to buy… bedding, then we have to hurry up.” Gu Fei kicked
        aside the tissues on the floor, and tidied up his pants as he spoke,
        “Any later and the only shops that would still be open would be the
        shops along this street. There won’t be much to pick from then.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng also got up and went to the bathroom to wash his face.
        When he came out, he was a little worried, “Hurry up and go wash your
        face…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What,” Gu Fei asked as he walked to the bathroom, “Scared that your
        snot rubbed on my face?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m afraid that you’ll catch a co…” Jiang Cheng started before
        realization hit him like a brick, “Fuck! There’s no way!”
      </p>

      <p>“… it didn’t.” Gu Fei went into the bathroom to wash his face.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stood in the living room and sniffled, noting that his nose
        was clear at the moment, so nothing should have gotten on Gu Fei’s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compared to the fact that he had done such a shameless thing when he was
        in a sober state, he unexpectedly cared much more about his snot
        problem… that rendered him speechless.
      </p>

      <p>
        After confirming that there were no snot problems, the panic resulting
        from the shame of doing something so scandalous slowly flooded over him,
        looming above him as it permeated his surroundings.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei came out of the bathroom with water dripping down his face,
        he couldn’t even look at Gu Fei in the eyes. His gaze was so evasive
        that one would mistakenly believe that he had done something like
        drugging Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s go.” Gu Fei rubbed at his face, seemingly infected by his
        embarrassment. He pulled out two tissues to wipe his face and walked
        towards the door.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng glanced at the tissues on the floor, wanting to clean
        them up, but he hesitated and felt inexplicably embarrassed… so he
        ignored them and followed him out.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this area, besides the location where Li Baoguo’s home was very much
        in a run-down state, the new terrain that Gu Fei brought him too wasn’t
        that different either – they were all pretty shabby. However, the
        lighting construction was much better here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Such a brightly lit old town would give people the impression that the
        place had a lot of stories to be told.
      </p>

      <p>
        And there were indeed many stories – Li Baoguo’s family alone already
        had many stories to tell. Then there’s Gu Fei… he turned his head to
        look at Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just up ahead,” Gu Fei said. “there’s a marketplace to the right where
        the vegetables are pretty cheap. If you want to cook for yourself, you
        can buy things there.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng responded.</p>

      <p>
        “Behind the fabric market ahead, there’s a clothing market that sells
        cheap and ugly clothes.” Gu Fei glanced at him, “If you want to save
        money, you can go there.”
      </p>

      <p>“… en.” Jiang Cheng laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “Then there’s the places to eat… I’ll take you there after we finish
        buying your comforters and whatever else.” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>“Alright,” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p>
        Many shops in the fabric market were closed, but fortunately, the side
        facing the street was still open. Jiang Cheng had no idea about how to
        pick these things, so he just looked at the colors.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This set <em>ba</em>.” He fumbled with a set of bedding with a
        wide-striped pattern.
      </p>

      <p>“This kind will pill,”<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Oh, Jiang Cheng withdrew his hand and felt another set. “Then this…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s no difference between the two, can’t you feel the difference?”
        Gu Fei asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Jiang Cheng put his hand back in his pocket, “How about
        <em>you</em> pick two sets <em>bei</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed and went over to search around. He picked a set: “This…”
      </p>

      <p>“It’s too ugly,” Jiang Cheng quickly said. “Cheap, but ugly.”</p>

      <p>
        “Then, you’ll just get pills <em>ba</em>,” Gu Fei started to laugh.
        “Expensive, but beautiful.”
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, Jiang Cheng bought two sets, one from each of the two
        materials. He was too lazy to continue shopping, so he decided just to
        buy the pillows and comforter in this store.
      </p>

      <p>“You only want one pillow?” the proprietress asked.</p>

      <p>“Ah, I sleep alone.” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “You can switch them around <em>ah</em>, or take it out for the other
        person to use when you need to share.” The proprietress insisted, “We’re
        going to close soon, I’ll let you have it for a little cheaper. Besides,
        even if you’re alone now, you’re not going to be alone in the future
        <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m… a high school student.” Jiang Cheng still wanted to save a bit of
        money, “By the time I’m sleeping with another person, the pillow will
        have rotted.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “This pillow is of great quality!” The proprietress said as she raised
        the pillow in front of him and patted it, “This elasticity! Besides,
        quite a lot of people live together in high school <em>ah</em>! I’ve
        seen quite a few. I’d also often have couples coming in one after
        another to buy bed supplies.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I only… want one.” Jiang Cheng was rendered absolutely speechless. If
        it were at any ordinary time, he would have definitely asked Gu Fei for
        help. But at this moment, he was embarrassed to even look at Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        “His mother goes to check his place every day, so he would usually go to
        a hotel. The place <em>really</em> doesn’t need two pillows.” Gu Fei
        remarked from behind them.
      </p>

      <p>“What the fuck?” Jiang Cheng whipped his head back.</p>

      <p>
        “Oh— so, it’s like that.” The proprietress had an ‘it’s just as I’ve
        said’ expression on her face,’ “It’ll just be one then.”
      </p>

      <p>
        They carried two bags of things back to the side of the street; it took
        the two a lot of time and effort to tie everything to the backs of the
        bicycles – they even had to ask the proprietress for two ropes in the
        middle.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We’re gonna go eat like this?” Jiang Cheng stared at the pile of
        things, “Are we going to carry these into the shop?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m treating you to something simple.” Gu Fei stepped on the pedal,
        “Then we won’t need to unload.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… alright.” Jiang Cheng also got on his bicycle, “What are we eating?”
      </p>

      <p>“Deep-fried rice cakes,”<sup>2</sup> Gu Fei said. “It’s delicious.”</p>

      <p>
        “You’re going to treat this orphan to deep-fried rice cakes?” Jiang
        Cheng laughed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s as delicious as Wang Er’s flatbread,” Gu Fei very seriously
        replied. “Really.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After they finished shopping, they went to find the fried rice cake
        shop. The awkwardness in Jiang Cheng’s heart had finally dissipated when
        they were on the road, and once he sat down with Gu Fei in the shop, the
        suffocating depression that had been pressing down on him during the
        past two days also faded away along with the awkwardness.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It just so happens that we can see the bikes outside from here,” Gu Fei
        commented after they sat down.
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng glanced around at the shop. The shop was super small,
        only being able to fit four or five small tables in total – and they
        were short tables too – so it was almost like they were squatting on the
        ground to eat.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the moment, there were a total of two tables, including theirs, that
        were occupied in the shop. The ones that sat at the other table were a
        few young girls; they were eating and chatting very lively.
      </p>

      <p>
        In contrast, he and Gu Fei were sitting face to face in silence,
        appearing exceptionally quiet.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I forgot to ask you,” Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Fei. “Did Boar Head come
        to cause trouble today?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No.” Gu Fei poured a cup of tea and placed it in front of him, “He just
        bluffed for a bit.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng took a sip of the tea: “Who are you deceiving, huh?”</p>

      <p>
        “I’m really not,” Gu Fei started to laugh. “Who dares to deceive a xueba
        <em>ah</em>. You’re so smart that you can even go off-script when
        reading a self-reflection paper.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything in response, and just stared at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took a sip of tea, but he was still staring. So Gu Fei stretched
        out his teacup until it was in front of him, lightly knocked it against
        his cup, and then took another sip of tea… but he continued to stare at
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>,” Gu Fei sighed. “It’s nothing serious. Let’s talk about it
        after the exams.”
      </p>

      <p>“He came to arrange a fight, right?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“He came to arrange a ball game.” Gu Fei laughed.</p>

      <p>
        “What’s the difference between playing ball and fighting to a person
        like him?” Jiang Cheng took a sip of tea, took a moment to contemplate,
        but then felt that something was off, “Wait, what face does he have to
        arrange anything, huh? They played so dirty… any face he had could be
        folded into a paper airplane and thrown out the window.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nevermind that, nothing will happen in the next few days. Just focus on
        the exams first.” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re not worried that it’ll affect my exams, are you?” Jiang Cheng
        questioned.
      </p>

      <p>“A little bit,” Gu Fei admitted.</p>

      <p>
        “Don’t worry,” Jiang Cheng said. “In a lousy little school like Si
        Zhong, I can still get first place even if I have a fever and amnesia…
        do you want to copy? Didn’t Zhou Jing say that you guys don’t switch
        seats for exams?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Nah, I won’t feel stressed even if I get a zero.” Gu Fei started to
        laugh again. He then gave a long pause before saying:
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>, you’re really…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hmm?” Jiang Cheng smelled the fragrant scent of the rice cakes and
        turned his head toward the kitchen.
      </p>

      <p>
        “… the most outstanding person that I’ve ever met ‘till now,” Gu Fei
        finished.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng froze. He then turned his head back but didn’t say anything.
      </p>

      <p>“Really,” Gu Fei insisted.</p>

      <p>
        “You’re the most un-thug-like thug that I’ve ever met ‘till now,” Jiang
        Cheng said in response. “You’re a warm and gentle thug, and… you’re very
        good-looking.”
      </p>

      <p>“Do you need me to compliment you back?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “There’s no need for that,” Jiang Cheng replied. “I know I’m handsome.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        The fried rice cakes were indeed delicious. When it came to finding
        inconspicuous but delightful food, Jiang Cheng felt that Gu Fei’s skills
        had been maxed out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Having cried to his heart’s content, done perverted things – although
        that matter shouldn’t be recalled in detail – had his stomach fed to the
        fullest, and bought all the things he needed, Jiang Cheng hiccupped as
        they made their way out of the small rice cake shop, feeling a lot more
        at ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go back <em>ba</em>.” Gu Fei checked out the time on his phone. “Don’t
        you still have to study?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t need to study, but I do need to sleep,” Jiang Cheng said with
        an insouciant shrug. “I never study during the last two days before an
        exam. I mainly sleep, regardless of how big or small the exam is.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh,” Gu Fei merely sounded in response. “Me too. Regardless of how big
        or small the exam, I’ve pretty much slept through them all the year
        before.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng couldn’t help laughing, and the two ended up laughing their
        heads off together. He almost laughed the mucus out of his nose and
        quickly took out a tissue to press against his nose. “Shit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Go back and quickly get some sleep. Don’t fall asleep halfway through
        the exam because of the cold,” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I won’t.” Jiang Cheng waved his hand, “I can finish writing it even
        with my eyes closed.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t,” Gu Fei said. “It’s hard enough to understand those words of
        yours when you write them with your eyes open, with your eyes closed…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shut the hell up for <em>laozi</em>.<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>” Jiang
        Cheng burst into another round of laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two of them rode their bicycles back to the rented apartment very
        slowly. Gu Fei didn’t go upstairs this time. He only retrieved the goods
        on the bicycle and handed them to him, “If you ever get lost again, just
        call me, and I’ll tell you how to get there.”
      </p>

      <p>“… I already know my way now,” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>“Goodnight.” Gu Fei gave a gentle smile.</p>

      <p>
        “Goodnight.” Jiang Cheng pushed the bicycle toward the stairwell, locked
        it up on the railing, and carried the supplies upstairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although the room he opened the door to was just as desolate as that of
        Li Baoguo’s place, the feeling, however, was already completely
        different. He no longer had to concern himself over Li Baoguo’s
        irritating problems, no longer had to help him pay his debts again and
        again, and no longer had to listen to his coughs and shouts from the top
        of his lungs. Most of all, he no longer had to worry about his bedroom
        door swinging open out of the blue.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng adjusted the temperature of the boiler until it was just
        slightly scalding and rinsed himself from top to bottom. There was even
        hot water here for him to shower in; he no longer had to fill up a
        bucket of hot water every single day like at Li Baoguo’s… actually, he
        had never even seen Li Baoguo take a bath before. Perhaps, he had always
        gone to the public bathhouse instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        The slightly scalding hot water flowed down his face, neck, and across
        his entire body. He closed his eyes and propped himself against the
        wall, letting his whole body slowly relax.
      </p>

      <p>
        But after rinsing for just a short while, he turned off the water,
        quickly wiped himself down, and walked out of the bathroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although it wasn’t strange at all to think of Gu Fei and the things that
        he and Gu Fei had done in this situation, it was still somewhat awkward.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had often let his imagination run wild about a certain celebrity, a
        certain little pornographic image that he didn’t know where he had seen,
        a certain part of a porn… it was the first time that Gu Fei had a target
        that was not only unequivocal, but also by his side. No matter how he
        could justify it, he would still feel a sense of guilt.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he returned to the bedroom, he closed the door and arranged the
        comforter and pillows that they had bought earlier that day. He had
        initially felt that the newly purchased duvet cover, sheets, and whatnot
        should be washed before he put them on… but as he stood by the bed and
        mulled over it, he decided to give up the thought altogether – men
        didn’t need to pay particular attention to these sorts of things.
      </p>

      <p>
        He got in bed. After he turned off the light, his eyes remained wide
        open for the longest time, but even then, he still didn’t feel sleepy.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, this time it was no longer because of Gu Fei, but about the
        exam tomorrow instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had spent the past half a semester in a daze – although there wasn’t
        anything in class that he couldn’t understand or any assignments that he
        couldn’t do, he was starting to worry a little.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the past, every time he relaxed at school, it would directly affect
        his grades. Now, in an environment like that of Si Zhong, even a person
        who listened carefully to the lesson in class was almost impossible to
        find. Even though the exam was undoubtedly less complicated than before,
        he was still a bit worried about his grades.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was ordinarily disinclined to study the day before the exam, but this
        time, he sat up, took out the notes from his school bag, and flipped
        them open.
      </p>

      <p>
        The exam times at Si Zhong were quite different from those of his
        previous school; he had to take exams for two subjects, Chinese language
        and politics, early tomorrow morning. He sighed. The schedule they
        arranged was so tight that it was nothing like Si Zhong’s sluggish style
        of pushing the play-offs of a basketball game to after the exams.
      </p>

      <p>
        He couldn’t recall when he had even fallen asleep, but when he woke up
        in the morning, his books had already been thrown to the floor, and the
        comforter was wrapped snugly around his body.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at the time. The alarm hadn’t gone off yet, but it
        was almost time to get up – his biological clock was fairly reliable at
        critical moments.
      </p>

      <p>
        The breakfast stalls on this side were about the same as those at Li
        Baoguo’s. He bought a bowl of sweet tofu and two deep-fried dough cakes
        from the roadside stall to eat, and then rode his bike to school.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stopped when he reached the intersection, wondering if he still
        needed to call Gu Fei so that they could head out together. After
        hesitating for some time, he took out his phone and prepared to dial the
        number.
      </p>

      <p>
        But just as he found Gu Fei’s name, he heard someone whistle him from
        the side. He swung his head over and was incredulous to see that Gu Fei
        was right next to him, straddling his bicycle with one foot on the
        ground.
      </p>

      <p>“Morning <em>ah</em>~ xueba.” Gu Fei waved his hand at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Damn.” Jiang Cheng looked at the time in astonishment, “What time did
        you get here?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just five minutes ago,” Gu Fei said. “I’ve never been late for an exam
        before.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s amazing.” Jiang Cheng started to chuckle, his mood suddenly
        improving and became exceedingly exultant. He didn’t know the exact
        reason, but when he saw Gu Fei smile, he felt very… intimate. Perhaps,
        it was because the two of them had done a bit of something – although
        neither of them had touched upon it – they were, after all, deskmates
        who had some impure relations…
      </p>

      <p>“Have you eaten?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I just randomly ate something,” Jiang Cheng said. “If you had told me
        that you were coming, I would’ve waited for you to eat together.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s fine,” Gu Fei said with a smile. “I also ate already. I figured
        that if you hadn’t eaten yet, I would’ve waited for you to finish.”
      </p>

      <p>
        It was pretty peaceful on the way to school; they didn’t run into those
        two zoo animals,<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> probably because they had
        already made an arrangement to fight… no, arranged a ball game; thus,
        they had to maintain the last bit of poise.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they entered the classroom, Jiang Cheng realized that these
        students, who were usually lazing around, would actually also display a
        bit of nervousness for a midterm exam.
      </p>

      <p>
        The desks had already been separated, and although it wasn’t by a
        considerable distance, it still made the desks appear to be
        single-person desks.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second he sat down, Zhou Jing wound his head around: “Jiang Cheng,
        Jiang Cheng…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you want to look at the answers, then just look by yourself. But if
        you dare to call out my name like that during exams, I’ll call you out
        for cheating right away.” Jiang Cheng pointed at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ay</em>! Okay, okay, okay, okay…” Zhou Jing was stunned but then
        smiled so brightly that his face practically bloomed flowers, “You’re a
        true friend.”
      </p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng.” Someone called out to him from the left.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng turned his head and found that Wang Xu was actually sitting
        on the seat to his left: “You’re sitting here?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll be sitting here during the exam.” Wang Xu said in earnest, “Don’t
        block the answer sheet with your hands, okay?”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng sounded in response.</p>

      <p>
        “When you’re done, don’t flip it over either, okay?” Wang Xu stated once
        more.
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng continued with an insouciant answer.</p>

      <p>
        “You don’t have to worry about Da Fei. He never cheats on exams. Just
        worry about me.” Wang Xu still wore a solemn expression, “I’m also
        responsible for spreading these to the others.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… understood.” Jiang Cheng nodded, then turned his head to look at Gu
        Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei, who was playing on his phone, turned to look at him, smiled, and
        didn’t say a word.
      </p>

      <p>
        The person serving as the proctor was a teacher that taught the Third
        Years, a very dignified middle-aged woman with glasses. The first thing
        she did after she entered the classroom and put down the exam papers was
        to stare at the students in the classroom, her gaze sweeping from left
        to right, then from right to left, and finally from front to back. Once
        she scoured through the entire room, she cleared her throat and read
        through the rules in the exam room.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the students were quieter than ever before, so utterly quiet that
        Jiang Cheng wasn’t quite accustomed to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the exam papers were passed out, Jiang Cheng first held the papers
        and roughly scanned through them only to discover that the difficulty of
        the exams in Si Zhong was, as expected, reasonably consistent with the
        overall style of Si Zhong. These exam papers were very simple – to him,
        at least.
      </p>

      <p>He flipped to the composition page and looked at it.</p>

      <p>
        Mr. Ji Xianlin<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a> once said: “Everyone strives for
        a perfect life, however, whether it is in ancient times or now, within
        the country or overseas, there is no such thing as a life that is one
        hundred percent perfect. So I say, life is imperfect.”
      </p>

      <p>
        According to his understanding, his task was to connect it to reality,
        formulate his own ideas, choose a literary form, and then write his own
        topic.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng lightly sighed. This composition topic was simply too
        <em>simple</em>, especially for his current self. Not to mention 800
        characters, even 8000 characters would be a piece of cake.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned the paper back to the front and started to solve the problems
        with peace of mind.
      </p>

      <p>The surroundings were still as quiet as before.</p>

      <p>
        Being able to hear the rustling sound of pens scratching against paper
        in a classroom where usually only the buzz of conversations could be
        heard felt strangely disturbing.
      </p>

      <p>
        He caught a fleeting glimpse of Gu Fei and noticed that he had yet to
        start on the questions. Instead, his gaze was buried in a modern light
        novel, reading the page with gusto.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had no intention of glancing to the left to find out what kind of
        situation Wang Xu was in; this was naturally because he didn’t even need
        to turn his head to sense Wang Xu’s hot gaze. He had already caught Wang
        Xu facing this way out of the corner of his eye.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two proctoring teachers were very stringent and frequently switched
        positions one after the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        Judging from how frequently Zhou Jing, who was seated in front of him,
        twisted his body… Jiang Cheng could safely deduce that his stomach was
        probably in tight knots.
      </p>

      <p>
        In comparison, Pan Zhi was much calmer. He maintained an unhurried pace
        as he haphazardly answered the questions, and once he had finished them
        all, he would correct them all together…
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei had finished reading the short article of modern literature.
        Unfortunately, it was not a simple story at all and instead emphasized
        the rational spirit of architecture… it didn’t look interesting at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        He flipped the paper back, intending to fill in the questions that he
        found familiar and could basically guess the answers to first, then
        start to draw straws. Then after drawing straws, he would fill in the
        empty spaces at random and write up a composition.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking into consideration that the composition was not limited to a
        certain literary form, and if the poem itself wasn’t restricted to 800
        characters either, he intended to take advantage of this loophole and
        write as little as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        He thought that his arrangement was perfect. When he took out the answer
        sheet and started to write, he felt that his condition was similar to
        that of the xueba next to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Xueba’s pen never stopped moving. He had essentially answered the
        questions as he read through them, and if the question was a bit longer,
        he didn’t pause for too long either. If Jiang Cheng’s image as a xueba
        wasn’t typically very pronounced in class, it was remarkably prominent
        now as he worked through the exams.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Gu Fei finished filling in what he was familiar with and started
        to draw straws for the multiple-choice questions, Jiang Cheng had
        already turned the page.
      </p>

      <p>
        And when he started the fill in the blanks, Jiang Cheng had begun
        writing the composition.
      </p>

      <p><em>Shit.</em></p>

      <p>
        He looked at Jiang Cheng’s profile, and for a moment… he felt that this
        sort of Jiang Cheng was so handsome that both humans and gods alike
        would be indignant.
      </p>

      <p>
        But compared to a xueba who was hell-bent on writing a composition that
        consisted of 800 characters long, Gu Fei’s poem that took advantage of
        the loophole would be much quicker to finish. He only pulled a few
        specious<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a> sentences and considered the
        composition completed. This type of exam paper that wouldn’t necessarily
        be checked, and even if it were, it would be done through drawing straws
        – he would only have a two-third chance of being chosen.
      </p>

      <p>
        Usually, he would turn in his exam papers around this time, but he
        didn’t move that day. Jiang Cheng, who sat to the side of him, was still
        writing, and he wanted to take a look at it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although Jiang Cheng’s characters were hideous beyond comparison, they
        were written relatively quickly, just like when he read the unscripted
        self-reflection paper – rows of words and paragraphs would appear only
        from him unconsciously scribbling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng placed the answer sheet and the exam papers at the corner of
        the desk. To his immediate left, Wang Xu frantically copied those
        answers, but for some of the fill-in-the-blank questions, he had to
        crane his neck just to see him – honestly, it looked rather arduous.
        Zhou Jing, in the front, was also facing some difficulties. With Jiang
        Cheng’s handwriting, it was already hard enough to make sense of what he
        wrote, so to read it upside-down was simply the same as reading an
        ancient imperial edict.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, it was still much better than before. If those that have better
        grades in the class were arranged to the front, then the gang of them in
        the back wouldn’t even know who to copy.
      </p>

      <p>
        With half an hour remaining until the end, Jiang Xueba, who had written
        like a god, had finished the composition. It seemed like he hadn’t
        bothered to check it either. He looked around, wanting to turn the
        papers in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu immediately became anxious when he saw that and kept his voice
        down: “Don’t rush it!”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng sighed and started to stare at the papers in a daze.</p>

      <p>
        After being out of it for a while, he turned his head and was met with
        Gu Fei’s eyes. He mouthed to him: “Did you finish?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>He then held up the composition for him to see.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was dumbfounded at first, but then turned to face his own
        papers and started to laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        This laugh was a struggle; he really wanted to laugh, but he couldn’t
        make any sounds, and he even had to press a tissue to his nose so he
        wouldn’t laugh his snot out. Gu Fei hadn’t wanted to laugh at first, but
        his appearance alone made it hard for him to hold back.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, Jiang Cheng laughed until he started coughing, and only then
        did he finally stop.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stood up and turned in the exam papers, then walked out of the
        classroom and went down the stairs. They were going to have another exam
        a while later, so he had to move around a bit – he even found sitting
        still for forty minutes in class to be irritating, so sitting still for
        so long in an exam was pure torture.
      </p>

      <p>
        Less than a few minutes later, Jiang Cheng also came down the stairs.
        This left Gu Fei in momentary shock: “You also turned in your exam
        papers?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng nodded, “The proctor was standing right next to Wang
        Xu, and I figured that he should’ve finished copying just about
        everything by then, so I just handed them in… was what you wrote just
        now lyrics or a poem?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “A poem <em>ah~</em>,” Gu Fei replied and sauntered toward the staff’s
        bathroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shit, you really are shameless.” Jiang Cheng followed him, whispering,
        “Is it because there’s no limit for a certain literary form that you
        wrote a poem?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei laughed. “I’ve written a poem three times now. The first
        time I had done that, Lao Xu and the others had even ended up debating
        on how many points should be given when they correct the paper.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re too brilliant.” Jiang Cheng clicked his tongue twice, “What did
        you write? Let me hear a few words.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s so beautiful that I’m too embarrassed to say it out loud,” Gu Fei
        said.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once they got to the place by the bathroom where nobody passes by, he
        took out a cigarette and shot a questioning glance at Jiang Cheng. Jiang
        Cheng shook his head, so he just lit a cigarette up for himself and
        dangled it in his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The lyrics you wrote were really good,” Jiang Cheng said. “Are you
        really not going to say a few words for me to hear?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That lousy poem is barely passable,” Gu Fei said. “When I have time
        again and have written some new lyrics, I’ll let you take a look.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright, then.” Jiang Cheng sat on the stairs, “Young man, are you
        growing <em>shy~</em>?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Probably because there was no one else to copy from, Wang Xu and the
        rest of the gang had also handed in their papers early and came down the
        stairs. They surveyed their surroundings, and when they caught sight of
        Gu Fei and Jiang Cheng, they all made their way over to them.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Bin a<em>h~</em>.” Wang Xu took out 50 RMB and handed it over to Lu
        Xiaobin. “Go buy something to eat and drink for our xueba to replenish
        his mind.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright.” Lu Xiaobin took the money and immediately ran off to the
        small shop attached to the school.
      </p>

      <p>“You guys are sick.” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>
        “You’re so wonderful, so generous!” Wang Xu rushed over and gave him a
        palm hold fist salute,<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> “This time, I’ll pass the
        exam this time with no problems! Maybe I’ll even move up in the ranks a
        bit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shit, I’ve never done so well on an exam before!” Zhou Jing lamented,
        “I’m not complaining, but Jiang Cheng <em>ah</em>, your handwriting is…
        honestly a god-level anti-copying device. Thank goodness my eyes are
        well-trained at copying. Tell me, have your points ever been deducted
        because the teachers couldn’t understand what the hell it is you wrote
        when they’re marking your papers?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Each time my points were deducted, it was all because the characters I
        wrote were too hideous,” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>The gang immediately turned into a laughing mass.</p>

      <p>
        The exams were still taking place in the nearby classroom. Thus the
        stoney-faced proctor rushed hotfoot to scold the lot of them when they
        heard their ruckus. They had no choice but to relocate, so they explored
        the area around the bathroom before finally choosing to sit at the stone
        table beside the bathroom entrance.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You know, I never understood why…” Wang Xu said. “… they had to set up
        tables and chairs outside the bathroom entrance?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What is there to wonder about that?” Jiang Cheng reasoned, catching
        sight of Lu Xiaobin, who was running back with a bag full of snacks and
        drinks. “Believe it or not, there are people who are willing to eat
        here.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The gang started guffawing like idiots again that very second, causing
        the proctor to charge over once more and force them to stand at the
        sports field.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next exam was on politics. Ten minutes before they were to enter the
        examination room, Lao Xu jogged over: “Jiang Cheng!”
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>“How are you feeling?” Lao Xu asked.</p>

      <p>“Pretty good, the questions weren’t very hard.” Jiang Cheng said.</p>

      <p>“And the composition?” Lao Xu further questioned.</p>

      <p>
        “It was pretty easy since the literary form wasn’t limited,” Jiang Cheng
        frankly replied.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I just knew it wouldn’t be a problem for you.” Lao Xu’s eyes lit up,
        “This time, we can definitely take down Class 2. It has always been that
        young lady in their class and Yi Jing competing for first place every
        time. There shouldn’t be a problem for you this time around!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Most likely…” Jiang Cheng originally wanted to mention how they had
        only taken one exam so far, but in Si Zhong… he could afford to show off
        for once.
      </p>

      <p>
        The politics exam was quite annoying. Although it was relatively easy to
        make wild guesses on the multiple-choice questions, the short-answer
        questions were designed to come for their throats. Gu Fei couldn’t write
        anything and only fill out the empty spaces out of habit. He had to
        bullshit three to four lines in the short-answer questions, though… this
        was more challenging, as the technical requirements for his bullshitting
        skills were very high.
      </p>

      <p>
        Especially on this one question that was worth 14 points, which asked
        them to explain the significance of integrating the various cultural
        activities at Si Zhong as well as discuss the importance of
        strengthening the campus’ cultural development… Gu Fei glanced over at
        Jiang Cheng only to find that the xueba was in the same state as when
        they had taken the language exam – his pen seemingly flew across the
        paper as those unsightly characters scratched the surface, creating one
        row after another.
      </p>

      <p>A xueba was really an intriguing creature…</p>

      <p>
        Copying on an exam for politics wasn’t easy. Once Wang Xu and Zhou Jing
        had copied the answers for the multiple-choice questions, they gave up
        on continuing to copy the short answers questions; compared to
        attempting to recognize Jiang Cheng’s characters, it was probably easier
        to rummage for answers in drawers, sleeves, waistbands, or any other
        method really.
      </p>

      <p>Just as before, Jiang Cheng turned in his papers in advance.</p>

      <p>
        Looking at his demeanor, Gu Fei considered it right that putting up a
        frontwas probably an everyday occurrence for this guy. When he was bored
        and observed him for a bit, he noticed that although both Jiang Cheng
        and Yi Jing had finished their exams at around the same time, Yi Jing
        would check and revise her answers when Jiang Cheng had already handed
        in his papers.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as he handed in the papers, the rest of the gang who couldn’t
        write anything on their own and had to copy but now had nothing to copy
        from and those like Gu Fei who had already finished randomly making
        things up, all handed their papers in together.
      </p>

      <p>
        At noon, nobody in the gang returned home. Who knew if it was because
        Wang Xu was feeling invigorated from copying so smoothly earlier that
        morning, but he was in a constant state of excitement and insistent on
        dragging them all to go eat stuffed flatbreads.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We have mathematics in the afternoon,” Wang Xu said while chewing on a
        flatbread. “We’re counting on you, xueba!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng lit a cigarette and pushed open the window to the side
        – every time he finished an exam, he would never have much of an
        appetite.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei, you’re really not going to copy anything at all?” Wang Xu asked
        Gu Fei again, “That would be such a waste.<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> I’ve
        never met such a wonderful xueba before!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you shout any louder, your mom will come over and make
        <em>you</em> into a stuffed flatbread.” Gu Fei said.
      </p>

      <p>“You’re really not copying?” Wang Xu whispered.</p>

      <p>
        “No thanks,” Gu Fei said. “It’ll make it easier for you guys to report
        back if you guys copied and managed to pass, but it’s not like I have to
        report back to anyone.”
      </p>

      <p>
        No one thought that anything was off about Gu Fei’s words, but Jiang
        Cheng suddenly felt the food in his mouth grow tasteless after hearing
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        While everyone was excitedly eating and chatting, he leaned toward Gu
        Fei and whispered: “Can you pass the final exam?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei glanced at him and laughed: “Good enough. Even if I fail, I can
        take the makeup exam. The questions in our makeup exams are pretty
        simple. You can probably do one without using a single one of your brain
        cells.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng responded and didn’t say anything else.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s attitude had always made him feel a little put off. He wasn’t
        sure if it was because his previous environment was different, but even
        someone as unreliable as Pan Zhi would grit his teeth and set up a few
        days to review before finals. For some unfathomable reason, the image of
        Gu Fei completely giving up filled him with a sense of agitation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>But what are you so agitated for</em>? There were no parents in Gu
        Fei’s family waiting to see his grades, and it seemed like there was
        also no reason to make it necessary for him to have the good grades
        needed to get into an excellent university…
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t worry about me.” Gu Fei’s leg gently touched his leg under the
        table, “I only need to muddle my way to a diploma.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s not that.” Jiang Cheng twisted his eyebrows, “You might as well go
        to a technical school if all you’re aiming for is a diploma. Wouldn’t a
        certificate from there be better than one from a shoddy and average
        school like Si Zhong?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s a long story.” Gu Fei smiled, “I’ll tell you one day when there’s
        time.”
      </p>

        The two-day midterm exam was finally completed under a tight schedule.
        According to Gu Fei’s observation and Jiang Cheng’s undisguised
        complacentness, he could pretty much guess Jiang Cheng’s grade. Yi Jing
        now had another competitor contending for first place in this grade.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The exam questions you have here are too simple,” Jiang Cheng had said
        those exact words at least three times in the past two days.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, when Lao Xu rushed into the classroom early in the morning with
        a face full of excitement, he was still taken a little aback. Gu Fei
        looked at Lao Xu; if his grades were only about the same as Yi Jing,
        then Lao Xu wouldn’t be that ecstatic – honestly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Students! Students!” Lao Xu stood on the podium, “I have good news to
        tell you all!”
      </p>

      <p>All the students in the class lazily clapped their hands together.</p>

      <p>
        “The teachers from your other subjects will definitely say it in class,
        but I’m going to say it a step ahead of them.” Lao Xu waved his arm,
        “This time, our class has a student that has received full marks on
        three subjects!”
      </p>

      <p>
        This news was indeed rather shocking. Everybody in the class suddenly
        fell into a discussion, with many of them focusing their eyes on Jiang
        Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ay</em>.” Jiang Cheng was probably not used to being stared at like
        this. He lay on his desk and sighed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who do you guys think it is? Which three subjects?” Lao Xu excitedly
        kept them in suspense, but this suspense didn’t last long enough to give
        them a chance to guess. He immediately announced the answer, “Student
        Jiang Cheng! Mathematics! English! Geography! All full marks!!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck—” This time, the entire class blew their lids and burst into an
        uproar.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Zhou Jing turned around and slammed into the table, “Jiang
        Cheng! You’re so awesome! You’re really too awesome!”
      </p>

      <p>“Ah.” Jiang Cheng sounded in response.</p>

      <p>“Sit properly,” Gu Fei shot a look at Zhou Jing.</p>

      <p>
        “Awesome!” Zhou Jing cried again, turned around, and sat down, then
        thought about it and turned back around, “Just awesome!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu was still excited on the podium. Gu Fei also lied down on the
        table, he looked at Jiang Cheng: “The rankings should be out by now.
        Wanna go and ask in a bit?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Not asking.” Jiang Cheng said. “What’s there to ask? Seriously, it’s
        just a midterm exam, and the questions you have here really are too
        elementary. I’ve never gotten full marks in geography before.”
      </p>

      <p>“Then I’ll go ask,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “What the hell are you all excited for <em>ah</em>?” Jiang Cheng said.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m going to ask… very calmly.” Gu Fei stuffed a piece of candy in his
        mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        After class ended, Gu Fei stood up, turned to leave the classroom, and
        directly followed Lao Xu to his office.
      </p>

      <p>“Xu Zong,” he called out to Lao Xu.</p>

      <p>
        “Why are you here?” Lao Xu looked at him, then took out a Red Bull and
        gave it to him in passing. “You can have it, Lao Lu just gave one out to
        everyone. I find it too sweet.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Has the grade ranking come out yet?” Gu Fei accepted the Red Bull and
        asked that one question.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re also concerned about this? You aren’t even in the top one
        hundred in the previous ranking, nevermind that, we won’t be able to
        find you no matter if we’re counting from the top hundred or the bottom
        hundred,” Lao Xu said.
      </p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng is first, right?” Gu Fei asked with a smile.</p>

      <p>
        At the mention of this, Lao Xu immediately became happy again. He got
        up, and while walking to the empty desk in the office, he beckoned to
        him: “Come take a look.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei walked over while taking out his phone.</p>

      <p>
        There was a large piece of red paper on the table. Lao Xu’s calligraphy
        was astoundingly beautiful, so much so that all the grade rankings were
        written solely by him every year before it was posted. This aspect was
        regarded as part of the school’s “cultural development”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei inched closer and saw the first place name at a glance – Jiang
        Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Jiang Cheng, <em>ah</em>?” He swiftly raised his phone and pressed the
        shutter, then turned around and left the office. “Xu Zong, you can
        continue to write.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After he left Lao Xu’s office, Gu Fei lowered his head and opened Si
        Zhong’s forum before he used his side account to make a post attached
        with the image that he had just taken.

        When Gu Fei returned to the classroom, the bell that signaled the start
        of class had already rung. He sat in his seat while Jiang Cheng, who was
        resting half his body on the desk, watched him intently.
      </p>

      <span id="more-6990"></span>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “As expected, there was no mishap,” Gu Fei said. “You’re first.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “You really went to ask <em>ah</em>?” Jiang Cheng was a bit taken aback.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Yes,” Gu Fei nodded. “And very calmly too.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">Jiang Cheng laughed and didn’t say more.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “But I didn’t ask what your total score was,” Gu Fei said. “We can
        calculate it once the announcement comes out later. I think…”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        He lifted his head and glanced over at Yi Jing: “The class
        representative-<em>daren</em>’s<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a> score probably
        differs from yours by a lot.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">“Is she second?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “En,” Gu Fei said. “In any case, if she’s isn’t first then she’s second.
        But she never really got full marks before… she’s a xueba from Si Zhong,
        not even close to being an opponent for a xueba from a big city’s key
        high school like you.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng couldn’t say anything in response.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Just the moment before, Pan Zhi had sent him an email; he had scanned
        and sent over images of the exam papers they had for this midterm exam.
        He roughly skimmed over the English portion and noticed that the
        difficulty was more than just one or two levels higher when compared to
        that of Si Zhong’s. Suddenly overwhelmed by a sense of restlessness, he
        planned to work on these exam papers once he got back to see just how
        much more difficult they were.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        – My mom agreed for me to go see you on Labour Day<a href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >, so be prepared to receive me.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">Pan Zhi sent another text message.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        – En. We won’t have to stay in the hotel this time, I moved out.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">– Holy fuck? What happened?</p>

      <p>– Let’s talk about it when we meet up.</p>

      <p>
        – Alright. Lao Yuan wrote a letter for you, I’ll bring it along and give
        it to you when I get there.
      </p>

      <p>– …</p>

      <p>– He sighs whenever he thinks of you.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng placed the phone back in his pocket and felt the urge to
        sigh as well for some reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Yuan was his previous homeroom teacher; he was quite a good person,
        but because he was in an awful mood when he left, he never went to bid
        farewell nor contacted him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Aside from Pan Zhi, whether it be his family, teachers, classmates, or
        friends, he was reluctant to contact any of them again – afraid of being
        asked about his current situation, afraid of hearing words of comfort,
        and afraid of recalling the past because of those people.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the last class of the morning, there was a bit of an uproar in
        the classroom. Although there were still the scores from two subjects
        that hadn’t been announced because they hadn’t taken the classes yet,
        there were already some people that had managed to inquire about the
        total score.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fucking hell?” Zhou Jing whipped his head around as he clutched tightly
        on his phone, “Jiang Cheng, Jiang Cheng, Jiang…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Have you really never been beaten up from acting like a repeater<a
          href="#_ftn3"
          >[3]</a
        >
        before?” Jiang Cheng shot him an irritated look.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Have you guys read this post?!” Zhou Jing glanced at him, then glanced
        at Gu Fei, and then switched his gaze back to his face once more before
        continuing to stare at him. “Someone made this post… You’re placed first
        in the entire grade <em>ah</em>!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Zhou Jing’s deskmate also turned back his head: “Your total score is
        more than 680! That’s almost 100 points higher than Yi Jing! She got
        599!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah! Fuck, 686 points!” Zhou Jing’s eyes were almost popping out of
        his face, “There has probably never been such a high total score in the
        history of Si Zhong! Fuck, Jiang Cheng, you’re awesome <em>ah</em>!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng himself was also caught a little off guard. He was also in
        the top ten of his grade in his previous school, moving up and down
        among those ranks with Lao Yuan calling him over for a discussion
        whenever he fell out of the top five, and had also taken first place
        before… but he had never encountered a difference of almost a hundred
        points between him and the second place before…
      </p>

      <p>
        This news didn’t excite him whatsoever, on the contrary, it made him a
        little flustered. According to the current situation, it wasn’t a
        problem for him to get first place in every exam, but how much worth
        does this first place actually amount to?
      </p>

      <p>
        However, when school was over at noon, Wang Xu and the rest of his gang
        surrounded him with excitement, as if they themselves were the ones that
        had taken first place while putting such a big difference between
        themselves and the second place, which made it so that Jiang Cheng
        didn’t even have the chance to muddle in his worries.
      </p>

      <p>
        A mass of people crowded in front of the bulletin board to look at the
        red announcement list that had been posted. The first and second place
        were both from Class 8. Although everyone was a xuezha, for this kind of
        matter, even if they were xuezhas, they were still very proud. After
        all, they were all xuezhas with collective senses of honor.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I don’t think this is scientific enough,” Guo Xu said. “They should
        also write all the total scores with the rest of it. Just writing the
        ranks isn’t enough to highlight Jiang Cheng’s wildness.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I think that it’s already fine the way it is,” Wang Xu quickly followed
        up. “You don’t have to step over the second place just to praise the
        first.”
      </p>

      <p>“That’s right,” Lu Xiaobin said. “<em>Yi Jing</em> is second.”</p>

      <p>Wang Xu glared at him but couldn’t find a way to retort.</p>

      <p>
        After checking out the red announcement list, the gang walked out of the
        school gate together. The finals for the basketball game was two days
        later so Wang Xu dragged them to the technical school to practice.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shit, who the hell posted this?” Wang Xu swiped through his phone as he
        walked, “This was in the office <em>ah</em>. The picture was taken
        before Lao Xu had even finished writing the red announcement list…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who knows who had passed by at the time,” Guo Xu said. “But I don’t
        believe that whoever posted this just happened to <em>pass by</em>. Give
        me a break, there are so many girls interested in Jiang Cheng right now,
        one of them must have gone to ask about it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s impossible for it to be a girl judging by the name,” one of their
        sub-players said. “Do you think it’s our opponents trying to start
        shit?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at the substitute player for two minutes before
        remembering that his name was Zhang Yuan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Zhang Yuan’s words aroused such a curiosity in him that his control
        finally cracked. He took out his phone and opened Si Zhong’s forum.
      </p>

      <p>
        He immediately caught sight of a post that was already tagged as a hot
        topic… how the hell did they manage to take a sneak shot of this in the
        office? And it was even avi?
      </p>

      <p>
        Before pressing into the post, he spotted the name of the poster and
        immediately swung his head around to look at Gu Fei who was walking at
        the very back.
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Gu Fei looked at him, unperturbed.</p>

      <p>
        “Isn’t this your fucking side account? Mr. ostentatiously_handsome?”
        Jiang Cheng interrogated in a low voice.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who?” Gu Fei had even changed his expression to one of bewilderment.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Devastatingly_handsome,” Jiang Cheng simply had to give Gu Fei’s naming
        abilities his utmost admiration, “If this isn’t you, I’ll immediately
        live broadcast myself eating shit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t.” Gu Fei cracked into a smile, “For the sake of not letting you
        eat shit, I’ll have to say it’s me even if it isn’t.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s fucking you.” Jiang Cheng took another glance at the time stamp of
        the post, “You went to look for Lao Xu the moment our first class ended.
        You must’ve made the post before you were even out of the office,
        right?”
      </p>

      <p>“I was already out,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        “No, wait.” Jiang Cheng found something very difficult to understand.
        “Why the hell are you doing this <em>ah</em>?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Just to show off a little,” Gu Fei responded quietly, then took a quick
        look at the group of people walking in front of them. “I don’t usually
        have anything worth showing off, so now that there’s a chance, I just
        wanted to show off my deskmate.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng stared at him in silence.</p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know why but the words ‘show off my deskmate’ that Gu Fei
        uttered made him feel very blissful – there was a faint sense of
        intimacy.
      </p>

      <p>
        The distance from their school to the technical school wasn’t very far,
        they had even stopped to eat something along the way, and the walk there
        could be considered both an exercise and an activity for digestion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng and Gu Fei remained in the back during the entire way there.
        Both of them opted to remain silent and gaze at the group of people that
        were in a rather jovial mood from finishing their exams and Jiang
        Cheng’s exceptional scores.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was getting warmer by the day, and on this day, Jiang Cheng only
        sported a T-shirt with a thin jacket over top. When he and Gu Fei walked
        side by side, their arms would occasionally brush by each other’s. This
        sort of fleetingly palpable contact brought him a sudden sense of
        contentedness.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know how to clearly phrase it, but it just made him feel very
        blissful.
      </p>

      <p>
        As they walked across the street – whether intentionally or
        unintentionally his arm bumped against Gu Fei’s several times. He
        wondered if there was a problem with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they reached a turn, Gu Fei suddenly knocked his arm against his.
      </p>

      <p>
        He turned to look at Gu Fei, who also turned to look at him, and then
        hit him with his arm once more.
      </p>

      <p>“Really? What are you doing?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“I am very vindictive,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        “It’s not like I hit you on purpose.” Jiang Cheng suddenly felt a faint
        stab of guilt afterward.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Well, <em>I’m</em> doing it on purpose.” Gu Fei smirked and hit him
        again with a raise of his arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re still going at it?” Jiang Cheng felt a rising urge to laugh, so
        he also bumped him.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei bumped back again.</p>

      <p>
        “Geez,” Jiang Cheng couldn’t hold back anymore, “How old are you, huh?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Younger than you are in any case,” Gu Fei said and knocked against him
        once more.
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck.” Jiang Cheng grew speechless and jabbed him with his elbow.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei swiftly returned the favor.</p>

      <p>He knocked against him again.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei did the same once more.</p>

      <p>Were they retards?</p>

      <p>Idiots?</p>

      <p>Had their brains gone to shit?</p>

      <p>
        The comments on Jiang Cheng’s inner video<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>
        barrage flew out by one by one, but his movements didn’t stop. And just
        like that, he and Gu Fei continued with this ‘if you hit me, I’ll hit
        you back’ game all the way there.
      </p>

      <p>
        There wasn’t much time at noon, so the gang didn’t formally divide into
        two teams to practice and mainly trained and strengthened their
        cooperation. The captain, Wang Xu, was now slightly more reliable
        compared to before. At the very least, he could spot everyone’s
        weaknesses and didn’t just randomly give commands when assigning
        exercises for them to practice like before.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ve been thinking about it a lot for the past two days,” Wang Xu
        started. “I think we still have to be mentally prepared for this coming
        match. I watched the video recordings of Class 2’s gameplay many times,
        and in my personal opinion, I think we can win against them, but it’ll
        be difficult.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “We just need to do our best.” Jiang Cheng squatted at the sideline,
        “Right now, our goal isn’t to get first place anymore.”
      </p>

      <p>“Then what’s our goal?” Wang Xu asked.</p>

      <p>
        “… not to get our teeth smashed.” Jiang Cheng replied with amusement.
      </p>

      <p>The entire team laughed for a long while.</p>

      <p>
        “We never thought of getting first place in the beginning anyway,” Jiang
        Cheng continued after laughing. “All we wanted was to be a dark horse.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s right!” Wang Xu waved his hand, “We’ve already become the dark
        horse now!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng shot him a thumbs up: “All we have to do now is play with
        all our strength, the result isn’t important anymore.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s phone went off in his pocket. He tossed the ball in his hand
        and it fell into the basketball hoop.
      </p>

      <p>
        He took out his phone to take a brief look and was surprised to find Hou
        Zi’s name displayed as the caller ID.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was just like what he had said to Jiang Bin, he and Hou Zi weren’t on
        friendly terms. Even though they had the other’s number, there were
        never any exchanges. Now that Hou Zi had actually called, he reckoned
        that this matter couldn’t be dragged on anymore.
      </p>

      <p>“Hello.” He walked to the side to answer the call.</p>

      <p>
        “You guys left pretty early today <em>ah</em>,” Hou Zi’s voice sounded
        from the other side. “We went over just to be met with an empty lot.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What?” Gu Fei’s brows knitted. “You want to drag in the people from our
        class as well?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Well, that’s not necessary.” Hou Zi laughed, “I don’t usually like to
        make it difficult for students. I just went over to ask you and that
        Jiang Cheng to come and play. Since you two are so arrogant, I had to
        personally go and ask myself <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>“When?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “This afternoon,” Hou Zi said. “I’ll wait for you two at the usual spot.
        Apart from that Jiang Cheng, you can choose to bring anyone else you
        want. Aren’t I generous?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei swept a glance over at Jiang Cheng just as Jiang Cheng had turned
        his head to look over at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright,” Gu Fei answered. “If Jiang Bin wants to show up, then let’s
        finish it once and for all today with just one round.”
      </p>

      <p>“No problem.” Hou Zi finished and hung up the phone.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei sent a message to Li Yan, telling him to notify the others, and
        then set an alarm. After setting it, he looked down at the screen and
        froze. Only when the screen finally went black did he put the phone back
        in his pocket and returned to the court.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu and the others were currently practicing at the height of their
        enthusiasm, so no one noticed him. Only Jiang Cheng walked over, stopped
        in front of him, and asked: “Who called?”
      </p>

      <p>“Hou Zi,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>“He arranged a time?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei nodded. “After the competition is over.”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng contemplated for a while: “Who else is going besides us?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Li Yan, Liu Fan, and the others,” Gu Fei said. “We often play with them
        together so we’re all familiar with their tactics.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “This doesn’t actually have anything to do with you, right?” Jiang Cheng
        spoke after a moment of silence.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It has nothing to do with anyone.” Gu Fei stooped down to his knees,
        “Class 7 was basically looking for trouble when they brought Jiang Bin
        into the game. When that person came, he wasn’t going to accept any
        losses, let alone lose the game.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t respond. After a while, he squatted down in front of
        him and peered at him: “If they try anything funny during the game, just
        bear with it.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “At worst, we’ll just receive some small injuries,” Jiang Cheng
        continued. “It’s better than having this dragged out.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Gu Fei continued to nod his head.</p>

      <p>
        “You’re being so obedient that something feels a little off…?” Jiang
        Cheng studied his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m giving an answer first before doing anything else.” Gu Fei laughed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t try to get even for me on this matter anymore,”<a href="#_ftn5"
          >[5]</a
        >
        Jiang Cheng warned. “I’m serious, otherwise, it’ll never end.”
      </p>

      <p>“I got it.” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>
        Neither of them spoke another word, just continued to look fixedly into
        each other’s eyes for a while.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei felt something flying over, followed by the sound of Wang Xu’s
        shout.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know what kind of posture it took to pass such a ball to a
        place where nobody could possibly pick it up – Gu Fei sighed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as he was about to raise a hand to block it, Jiang Cheng had
        already tilted his head over, reached out, and caught the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This conditioned reflex of yours.” Gu Fei sighed again, this time with
        a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng passed the ball back to Wang Xu then stood up and dusted off
        his hands. He was about to go to practice with the others but after
        walking just two steps, he stopped and looked back at Gu Fei. “Don’t go
        alone.”
      </p>

      <p>“I know.” Gu Fei waved his hand with some impatience.</p>

      <p>
        After practicing for the entire noon, everyone still felt an urge to
        continue even after the time was up.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I think playing ball is very interesting,” Zhang Yuan said. Even though
        he was just a substitute, he was also left in a state of excitement
        after the previous match where he had only gone onto the court twice.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We can still play by ourselves after the competition is over. We can
        practice a little during ordinary times and play again next semester.”
        Wang Xu said coolly as he flung his jacket on his shoulder.
      </p>

      <p>Everyone nodded one after another.</p>

      <p>
        “You can also find some time to teach the girls,” Jiang Cheng said.
        “That way, they won’t have to go on a day trip next time.”<a
          href="#_ftn6"
          >[6]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah!” Wang Xu’s eyes suddenly lit up, “I think Yi Jing and the others
        actually really like to play, but no one teaches them…”
      </p>

      <p>
        As they approached the school gate, Gu Fei’s phone rang. He answered the
        call: “What? Oh… I forgot. I’ll do it now then. Okay, I’ll head back
        now.”
      </p>

      <p>“What’s wrong?” Jiang Cheng asked soon after.</p>

      <p>
        “I have to take Er Miao to her medical checkup this afternoon. I forgot
        that I made an appointment with the doctor the last time we were there.”
        Gu Fei said in a low voice. “Cheng-<em>ge</em>, help me tell Lao Xu,
        otherwise, he’s going to call me until my phone blows up again.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng nodded, “Are you telling me the truth?”</p>

      <p>“It’s the truth,” Gu Fei laughed.</p>

      <p>
        After Gu Fei watched Jiang Cheng, Wang Xu, and the rest of them enter
        the school together, he went to the parking lot to get his bicycle and
        rode back to the shop.
      </p>

      <p>
        Liu Fan’s lousy Benni<a href="#_ftn7">[7]</a> was already parked in
        front of the shop.
      </p>

      <p>
        He pulled open the car door and scrutinized the interior: “Can this car
        still move?”
      </p>

      <p>
        There were four people in the back seat: the three Bu Shi Hao Niao, and
        Li Yan, who had been squished to the point he had to sit directly on Luo
        Yu’s lap.
      </p>

      <p>“Hurry up,” Li Yan said. “I’m basically squatting here.”</p>

      <p>
        “I’m not going to be repulsed by you if you just sat down,” Luo Yu
        casually said.
      </p>

      <p>“But I’m repulsed by you,” Li Yan retorted.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei sighed and climbed into the car.</p>

      <p>“You didn’t call Jiang Cheng?” Liu Fan started the car.</p>

      <p>
        “Can this car even fit another person?” Li Yan stated. “Isn’t it fine if
        he goes there by himself?”
      </p>

      <p>“I didn’t tell him,” Gu Fei spoke.</p>

      <p>
        All the people in the car suddenly fell silent. After turning the car
        around, Liu Fan glanced at him without speaking.
      </p>

      <p>After some time, Li Yan finally let out a soft: “Fuck.”</p>

      <p>
        The ‘usual spot’ that Hou Zi mentioned was an old outdoor lighting
        stadium. It was a rather remote place that not many people would
        normally go to, nor would any normal person actually go. The place had
        long been occupied by all sorts of wayward youths and middle-aged men –
        no person in their right mind would willingly come here to look for
        trouble.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Liu Fan parked the car, Gu Fei didn’t get out. He gazed ahead at
        the two concrete courts that were surrounded by shabby wire fences –
        every time he came here, he felt as if he was walking into an
        encirclement of high walls.
      </p>

      <p>
        The few people in the car didn’t make a move to get out, they all
        quietly stared at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This matter,” Gu Fei started. “I’m fine with taking care of it by
        myself, you guys…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the fuck are you talking about, I thought you wanted to talk about
        some battle plans or something,” Liu Fan retorted, opening the door.
        “Hou Zi coming at you is the same as him coming at us. If he was looking
        for a fight then you could say it’s your one-person thing, but to
        arrange a ball game, he’s obviously dragging us in too. Take care of it
        by yourself my ass.”
      </p>

      <p>“Get off.” Li Yan patted him on the shoulder.</p>

      <p>
        A lot of people had already gathered on the court. Gu Fei surveyed the
        people around them and pretty much recognized every single one of them.
        There usually wouldn’t be very many people who would choose to play a
        serious game here; most of the time, people would just play casually, or
        maybe they wouldn’t even be playing. They would just hang around here
        and if they find you pleasing to the eye, they would talk to you. But if
        they don’t, then they would use their fists.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether it was playing ball or fighting, the audience would be equally
        fired up.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both Hou Zi and Jiang Bin were already standing on the sidelines. Hou Zi
        leaned against the barbed wire fence with a cigarette in his mouth and
        nodded at them when he saw them coming in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hou Zi wasn’t going to go on. He didn’t really like to play, but he
        would certainly be spectating. Not to mention that it was his xiaodi<a
          href="#_ftn8"
          >[8]</a
        >
        and his younger cousin that were going to play this so-called ball game.
        Just based on the fact that he had always been waiting for a chance to
        sort him out, coming to this ball game was a must for him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei definitely didn’t think that he was taking things on for Jiang
        Cheng because of any glorious intentions, he just felt like since they
        couldn’t dodge the trouble that Hou Zi was giving them this time. He
        might as well solve it all in one breath. He didn’t want to drag Jiang
        Cheng into this kind of low-level, meaningless fight.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Start playing once you’ve picked your people.” Hou Zi looked at Gu Fei,
        “We have half an hour. Whoever scores the most points wins.”
      </p>

      <p>“Are there any rules?” Gu Fei shrugged off his coat.</p>

      <p>“No,” Hou Zi answered.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t respond. He turned around and walked to the side with Li
        Yan and the others: “Li Yan isn’t going on. The five of us are going to
        play,and Li Yan will be in charge of keeping an eye on their people.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Li Yan sounded and folded his arms together.</p>

      <p>
        There were no rules in this kind of game. Naturally, all kinds of petty
        tricks would be used since there wasn’t anyone on the side to referee,
        and those on the court couldn’t bother to care.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Da Fei,” someone in the stands leaned over the railing and called out
        to Gu Fei, “Need help?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei turned around; they were a couple of familiar people that he had
        played with before. He shook his head: “There are no rules today.”
      </p>

      <p>Those people nodded, not saying anything else.</p>

      <p>
        If it was a normal game, there would still be general guidelines to
        follow even if everybody played dirty, so it would be fine if there were
        people that wanted to go up and play together. But when the game had no
        rules, everyone knew what kind of game it really was.
      </p>

      <p>
        The five people on Jiang Bin’s side had all played with them before, so
        everybody had a somewhat clear idea of the others’ skill sets. But for
        this game, no one was clear on the ins and outs. After all, they had
        never fought together before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Several of them had something hidden in their wristbands, but Gu Fei
        didn’t. He wasn’t used to utilizing any props in these kinds of
        situations – if they really were to start something, then he preferred
        to use his hands.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thinking up to that point, Gu Fei suddenly had a rather funny thought.
        If Jiang Cheng was here, he could arrange for him to not go on court,
        but to find somewhere to stay in the stands and use his slingshot to…
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was amused by this thought of his, thus he lowered his head to
        laugh.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Aye,” Li Yan looked at him. “Be serious, it’s a fight
        <em>ne</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I know.” Gu Fei laughed a few more times before turning toward the
        court.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was sprawled over his desk as Lao Lu gave a vigor-filled
        lecture at the front of the class. Their major course was in the
        afternoon; the class-full of people were completely lifeless – even the
        number of people chatting had reduced.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Lu was even more impassioned than usual, most likely because Jiang
        Cheng’s full marks had put him in a cheerful mood. Even after half a
        class, he hadn’t started cursing even once.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wasn’t listening to the lesson either. He had his phone in
        hand and was looking through the exam papers that Pan Zhi had sent over.
        He had started doing the questions since the start of class, and now it
        has already been 20 minutes. The speed at which he answered the
        questions was significantly slower than when he was taking Si Zhong’s
        midterm exam.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t stop during the breaks between classes either; but continued
        to answer the questions as he laid flat on his desk, even using up his
        entire self-study period.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, after he completed all the questions, he took photos of all the
        answers and sent them to Pan Zhi, asking him to help take them to the
        English teacher to be looked over.
      </p>

      <p>
        His mood wasn’t that particularly good that afternoon – but it wasn’t
        because of the ball game nor that he didn’t sleep well.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked briefly at the empty seat beside him… it was because of Gu
        Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know why, but since he had finished helping Gu Fei ask Lao Xu
        for leave, he was inexplicably restless. Now he was draped over his desk
        as he repeatedly contemplated every detail that occurred since the phone
        call Gu Fei had received during practice until the moment he went home.
      </p>

      <p>
        There weren’t any problems, and everything appeared to be very normal,
        but he couldn’t help the gnawing sense of unease from welling up in his
        guts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even after fidgeting in his seat for a long time, Jiang Cheng couldn’t
        hold himself back. He didn’t even wait for the class to end before he
        took out his phone and, without bothering to send a message, he directly
        dialed Gu Fei’s number.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei has always been very meticulous when taking care of Gu Miao, but
        now he forgot the time that he had booked with the doctor? He just
        couldn’t believe it.
      </p>

      <p>
        At least the call went through – Gu Fei hadn’t turned off his phone.
      </p>

      <p>
        But nobody picked up. The ringtone rang until it automatically hung up…
        Gu Fei didn’t answer the phone the entire time.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng frowned and redialed.</p>

      <p>Still, no one answered.</p>

      <p>“Fuck.” Jiang Cheng suddenly couldn’t sit still any longer.</p>

      <p><em>°</em></p>

      <p>The author has something to say: Continuing tomorrow.</p>

      <p>
        “The long comment in the previous chapter was very interesting,
        <em>oh</em>. ⊙▽⊙.” Said the slightly anxious author as she rubbed at her
        coffee cup, her legs shivering furiously.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>, do you want to go take a look?! o(≧口≦)o” The black
        furry spirit that was pressing against the cabinet door shouted.
      </p>

      <p>°</p>

      <p>The translators have something to say:</p>

      <p>
        Sae: You know what I like about the gang of Wang Xu’s friends that hang
        around Jiang Cheng, they are proud of his xueba title lol love it!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ice: This ice cube recalls its glory days… where it was ranked first in
        the entire grade and had a history score that was 98%, the person in
        second place having a score that was 11% behind it… then the next year,
        it was only in the top 15… and finally the last… *cries into a puddle*
        ahhhh the glory days… QvQ (ice cube has fallen behind in the past two
        years…)

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Bin was standing at the sidelines with folded arms. Gu Fei and the
        others were already in the middle of the field, yet Jiang Bin had no
        intention of going over.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “The fucking bastard is clearly waiting for Jiang Cheng,” Li Fan stated.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Gu Fei turned to look at Jiang Bin, but Jiang Bin stayed rooted in place
        without a hint of moving.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Are we gonna play or not?” Gu Fei asked.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Bin sneered and looked down at the black brass knuckle on his
        hand. It was only after a long time did he finally raise his head again:
        “Where’s Jiang Cheng?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “You can just add his debts to mine.” Gu Fei said. He was well aware
        that as long as he didn’t see Jiang Cheng, Jiang Bin wouldn’t agree to
        start so easily. He was originally contemplating on how to solve this
        problem, but when he spotted the brass knuckle on his hand, he
        immediately knew that the situation was going to be an easy one to
        solve.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        That brass knuckle belonged to Hou Zi. For Hou Zi to give it to Jiang
        Bin meant that the matters between the two of them would also have to be
        settled that day. Hou Zi backing up Jiang Bin was only an excuse. Hou
        Zi’s target wasn’t Jiang Cheng – it was him.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        If that was how it all was, then it was actually much easier to deal
        with.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Add it to yours?” Jiang Bin started to laugh, “How come I didn’t know
        that you took in a lackey?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “It’s not like you’ve been around Hou Zi for only a day or two,” Gu Fei
        calmly relayed while fixing his wristband. “How come you haven’t learned
        even a bit of his self-possession <em>ah</em>?”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Fucking say that again!” Jiang Bin was suddenly overtaken by a surge of
        fury. He didn’t even bother keeping his arms folded anymore as he rushed
        in front of him with only two steps, nearly jabbing his finger in his
        face.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “There are always going to be wins and losses in a game. If you want to
        play, then you must know how to admit defeat. Did your cousin not teach
        you this?” Gu Fei swept a glance at Hou Zi who was looking at them in
        silence with a cigarette in his mouth. Gu Fei turned his head back to
        look at Jiang Bin. “<em>You</em> made the first move during the game. He
        is a student, nevermind fighting back, he never even got to answer back
        <em>ba</em>? You just have to grab on and refuse to let it go. This
        doesn’t seem like someone that has followed Hou Zi before <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Bin was pretty good at fighting and basketball, but when it came
        to articulating himself, it was a little difficult for him. Plus, there
        were a multitude of spectators on the stands and not a single one of
        them could be considered to be a good person. These people, despite
        whether they were being genuine or not, would still keep the word
        ‘reasonable’ at the tips of their tongues. This was why when Gu Fei
        finished speaking, Jiang Bing turned red in the face and froze in place
        without being able to squeeze out a single word.
      </p>

      <p>Finally, completely infuriated, he looked over at Hou Zi.</p>

      <p>
        “Hurry it up.” Hou Zi said impatiently with the cigarette still in his
        mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s only going to be you and me today.” Gu Fei stared down at Jiang
        Bin, “Whoever concedes or <em>doesn’t</em>, let’s settle this in one
        go.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Bin stared at him for a full five seconds before squeezing a word
        from between the gaps of his teeth: “Fine.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The game was only to last for half an hour. There would be no timeout
        nor substitutions in the middle, and aside from someone coming in to
        toss the jump ball, there were no referee or scoreboard either – the
        audience in the stands was the scoreboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        And if a bet happened to take place, then the score would be kept even
        more meticulously than an actual scoreboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Liu Fan and Qian Kai came up for the jump ball. Both of them kept their
        eyes glued on the ball and the spectators of the game… or rather the
        spectators of the fight, all fell silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        The person who was responsible for tossing the ball threw it in the air
        and immediately ran off the court as if his life was on the line.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this sort of game, each and every person had ‘something’ on them. If
        he didn’t leave the court before the game started, he could’ve been
        accidentally injured by someone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although the actual purpose of this game had nothing to do with
        basketball, Liu Fan was the only one among the few of them to have ever
        gone to the police station. Just after the Lunar New Year, he had stayed
        there for a week, but he was also the one on their side that loved
        playing basketball the most. Thus, it was not surprising that Liu Fan’s
        hand would shoot straight toward the ball.
      </p>

      <p>However, Qian Kai’s wasn’t. His sole target was Liu Fan’s arm.</p>

      <p>
        The second Liu Fan’s hand slapped the ball toward Gu Fei, Qian Kai’s
        hand followed Liu Fan’s before he slashed down from his wrist all the
        way to his forearm.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time as when Gu Fei caught the ball, he saw the line of
        blood running down Liu Fan’s arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        He gripped the ball and turned around before he started dribbling it
        toward the basket on the other side of the court.
      </p>

      <p>
        The sound of footsteps rang out from behind him – someone was quickly
        charging over. Gu Fei advanced another two more steps with the ball
        before suddenly darting to the side. He then leaped up and made a shot
        for the basket.
      </p>

      <p>
        Out of the corner of his eyes, he caught sight of Jiang Bin rushing in
        from his right and swiping at his side with his left hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei only felt something scraping roughly right below the right side
        of his ribs, but he didn’t sense any pain when he landed on the ground.
        He stared at the rim of the basket; it was only after he watched the
        ball sink in that he finally allowed himself to glance down and check
        his own situation.
      </p>

      <p>
        A cut had ripped apart his T-shirt and when he lifted it, he saw the
        crude mark made by the brass knuckle on his waist. The moment he looked
        down to check on it was when the blood finally started to slowly seep
        out from the uneven wound.
      </p>

      <p>
        He grabbed at his shirt and carelessly pressed it against the wound. It
        was a shallow cut, and aside from it looking quite ghastly, it didn’t
        affect him in the least.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Bin served the ball to which he passed to Qian Kai. Gu Fei
        originally wanted to intercept but upon seeing that Liu Fan had already
        gone over, he instead made a beeline toward the midline to prepare for
        defense.
      </p>

      <p>
        The wound on Liu Fan’s arm was bloody, but it didn’t seem to be too deep
        either. Before Gu Fei had a chance to take his eyes off of Liu Fan’s
        arm, he heard Li Yan’s voice from outside of the court. “Da Fei, behind
        you!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Without turning around, he directly bent down at his waist and
        somebody’s fist swung by from above him.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was only the first ball and it had already become like this… Gu Fei
        felt that even if they took the beating and didn’t retaliate during this
        game, for them to be able to persevere through five minutes of this
        match was a miracle in and of itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        And it wasn’t as if they hadn’t struck back either. Over on the other
        side, Li Fan employed the same method that Qian Kai had used earlier as
        he intercepted the ball – he stuck his wristband that had something
        secretly concealed in it by Qian Kai’s arm and swiped down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei couldn’t clearly see the situation from this angle, but from how
        the muscles on Qian Kai’s face spasmed, it probably wasn’t a light
        swipe.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was impossible for this match to last for a whole half an hour, let
        alone five whole minutes. Gu Fei straightened himself up.
      </p>

      <p>
        He wasn’t too familiar with the guy that had swung his fist at him from
        behind. He neither knew his name or nickname, thus he could only learn
        from Jiang Cheng and came up with a name for this guy, ‘Little Swinger’.
      </p>

      <p>
        Little Swinger’s fist was directed toward the back of his head. If he
        hadn’t evaded, he would definitely be lying on the ground at the moment
        and whether he would be able to immediately get back up again wasn’t
        even a certainty.
      </p>

      <p>
        This group of people was evidently more vicious than even Hou Zi’s own
        men. Hou Zi at least somewhat abided by the Jianghu<sup>49</sup> code;
        even if it was only in appearances, he still wanted to save some face.
        But these guys were on a whole different level. With these people
        around, even walking required one to be extra careful in case one
        accidentally steps and trips over someone’s pride.
      </p>

      <p>
        Little Swinger’s fist came up empty. Then without even a hint of
        hesitation, he pulled his hand back and aimed yet another swing at Gu
        Fei’s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei spotted a steel conical broach in his hand. The thing itself
        wasn’t that particularly sharp and had a round blunt head, but if one
        was smashed by it… Gu Fei raised his left hand to make a block with his
        forearm and, using it as a pivot to press against Little Swinger’s
        elbow, he used his right hand to firmly grip Little Swinger’s wrist and
        harshly snapped it back.
      </p>

      <p>
        Little Swinger froze for two seconds before he let out a blood-curdling
        screech. Gu Fei then shoved him to the side and caught the ball that Luo
        Yu had just passed over to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        After rushing the ball past two more people, Jiang Bin obstructed the
        path ahead of him. Gu Fei came to an abrupt stop and prepared to make a
        three-point shot.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time as when the ball flew out of his hand, Jiang Bin
        charged in front of him and forcefully brought his hand down on him. The
        brass knuckle first landed on his shoulder before suddenly sliding down
        into a slash with the momentum.
      </p>

      <p>
        A deafening series of whistles and applause burst from the stands. For a
        three-point shot to be successful even under such circumstances, even Gu
        Fei admired himself a bit.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the match could no longer proceed. Jiang Bin was completely unable
        to keep himself composed and was even more disinclined to pretend. If it
        was to continue like this, even if they manage to earn a higher score,
        not many of them would be able to remain standing by the end of it all.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, even if Jiang Bin and his gang, that were the type of people
        to blatantly ignore what was evidently a fight under the guise of a ball
        game, they managed to win by scoring more points under said
        circumstances… this matter would still be far from over.
      </p>

      <p>The only way.</p>

      <p>The only way.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei suddenly felt a bit deplorable – the only way was learned from
        that father of his.
      </p>

      <p>
        That was to make your opponent never dare touch you again in one shot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether it was his mother’s unreliable suitors, the Hou Zi of the past,
        or that Little Swinger from just then… whether or not he had done it
        intentionally, his father’s way of doing things that had terrified him
        to the point of nightmares since he was young had already been
        unwittingly written in his blood…
      </p>

      <p>
        When the brass knuckle in Jiang Bin’s hand swept toward him for a third
        time, Gu Fei raised his arm, and twisting back his shoulders and hips,
        he landed a harsh slap across the left side of Jiang Bin’s face.
      </p>

      <p>
        It wasn’t the usual sharp and crisp sound of a slap, instead, it was a
        dull yet loud sound.
      </p>

      <p>
        That ruthless strike sent Jiang Bin spinning from where he stood before
        he fell to the concrete ground. Even the sound of his head hitting the
        ground wasn’t as loud as the slap that landed on his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        All the people on the court froze and there was a brief silence from the
        audience in the stands.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Bin lied plastered to the ground and it was only after several
        seconds that he began to struggle to get up again. But after just two
        attempts, with each time resulting in him collapsing again, he could
        only use his hands to push himself slightly off the ground and begin to
        vomit in the end.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fucking hell—” The dozens of spectators on the stands watching the show
        started to shout, their whistles and screams mixed together, showing
        their utter excitement.
      </p>

      <p>
        For them, it didn’t matter who lost or won, and it didn’t matter who it
        was that got beaten down either. As long as someone fell, got injured,
        or couldn’t get up, they would be thrilled.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everyone on the court gathered around. Qian Kai went over, intending to
        help Jiang Bin up only to have Gu Fei glance up at him: “Is it you?”
      </p>

      <p>“… what?” Qian Kai froze.</p>

      <p>
        “The next one,” Gu Fei looked at him and spoke with a low voice, “Is it
        you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Qian Kai made no sound in response and stayed frozen in place, not
        daring to directly go and assist him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We’ll stop the match then.” Gu Fei turned his head to slowly stare at
        the people around him. “Let’s just resolve this directly. Who else is
        there? Let’s get it over with already.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The situation sank into an awkward stalemate. A single slap from Gu Fei,
        who had nothing else in his hand, was enough to render Jiang Bin
        incapable of getting up again, leaving him to continue vomiting himself
        into unconsciousness as he sprawled on the ground. There was also the
        other guy who was cradling his arm that hurt so much he didn’t even dare
        touch it – it was most likely broken. Not a single person dared to go up
        and face off against him anymore.
      </p>

      <p>
        But this was a ‘one go to settle it all ball game’ after all. If they
        really were to not make a move now, it would mean that they would never
        be able to make a move on him in the future…
      </p>

      <p>
        “Help him up.” Hou Zi’s voice sounded from behind, breaking the
        stalemate.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this, a few people finally came over and hauled Jiang Bin up. Jiang
        Bing was a little unsteady on his feet and looked to be disoriented – he
        was only able to stop swaying when two people supported him from either
        side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hou Zi shot Gu Fei a glare and then walked over to Jiang Bin. “How are
        you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Can’t hear too well.” Jiang Bin coughed a couple of times, “Ears are
        ringing.”
      </p>

      <p>“Take him to the hospital.” Hou Zi frowned, “And wipe your mouth.”</p>

      <p>
        The handful of people prepared to leave with Jiang Bin but as they
        passed by Gu Fei, Jiang Bin struggled a little and stared at Gu Fei
        intently.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tinnitus was a given to occur. Perhaps, it was even more severe than
        tinnitus, but Gu Fei wasn’t concerned about anything at the moment.
        Unlike Jiang Cheng, who was worried if a person who fell outside in the
        snow would freeze to death, he wouldn’t linger in fear.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei leaned in close to Jiang Bin’s right ear and clearly articulated
        every word: “Take it that this is done and over with today. I’m the kind
        of person that doesn’t like to stir up trouble. As long as you don’t
        provoke problems for me, I would never go after anyone.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Bin was silent, though it wasn’t clear if he had fully heard those
        words as he stared at Gu Fei for another moment before walking away.
      </p>

      <p>
        As soon as Jiang Bin’s people withdrew, the only ones that were left on
        the court were Hou Zi, Gu Fei, and the rest of his team. However, even
        with just them, the spectators’ interest did not diminish in the
        slightest. Although no one dared to surround them, they all stood
        nearby, waiting with bated breath for the possibility of a second match.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wasting their own time and surrounding others only for a chance to catch
        sight of another’s blood, even though they were all spectators, these
        people simply disgusted Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Still so ruthless of you <em>ah</em>. You’ve always settled things with
        one move.” Hou Zi looked at Gu Fei, “It’s been almost two years and yet
        you still haven’t lost even a bit of power.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t say anything.</p>

      <p>
        Truth be told, he wasn’t completely unafraid of Hou Zi like he was to
        Jiang Bin. Hou Zi was older than him by quite a few years and had
        started prowling around the streets before he had even finished middle
        school. He was different from those who only mixed in the circle for a
        few years before getting a job or returning to a civilian lifestyle. Hou
        Zi was the type of person who had purposely stepped foot into the
        darkness with no intention of backing out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “And here I thought that being in a normal high school would teach you
        to be less temperamental than a reformatory school.” Hou Zi sneered,
        “You know, I originally wasn’t going to meddle with yours and Jiang
        Bin’s affairs. After all, I did say that he should resolve things
        himself and that whether he wants to or not, he has to concede to the
        outcome. But it’s a different case now. Since you decided to take this
        on for Jiang Cheng, it’s only fair if I take this on for Jiang Bin.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei still didn’t utter a word.</p>

      <p>
        “Frankly, I don’t want to do this either <em>ah</em>.” Hou Zi stretched
        his waist and lit a cigarette, “But think about it, <em>we</em> can
        settle the issue between us at the same time, otherwise, I don’t think
        I’ll ever be at peace.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I have a match the day after tomorrow,” Gu Fei said. “After the match.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Hou Zi was also a person that held grudges and the issue with Jiang
        Cheng was just an excuse. Back when he came to collect protection fees,
        Gu Fei had damaged his bladder with a single kick. Although more than a
        year had gone by since then, let alone someone that bore grudges, even
        if he wasn’t the type to hold a grudge, this matter was not one that he
        could easily let go of.
      </p>

      <p>
        There definitely needed to be an excuse if one wanted to seek revenge
        after such a long time, and now one finally appeared, but Hou Zi knew
        that he wasn’t a threat in a one-on-one fight. Surrounded by a mass of
        people adding onto the fact that he had violated Hou Zi’s “principals”,
        Gu Fei could only decide a time. What method to use was up to Hou Zi to
        decide.
      </p>

      <p>“A school match?” Hou Zi asked.</p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei sounded in response.</p>

      <p>
        Hou Zi had a dumbfounded expression. The exaggerated expression made it
        clear at a glance that he and Jiang Bin were relatives. It was only
        after a long time that Gu Fei finally let out a laugh: “There’s been
        some changes after all. Si Zhong is a good place <em>ah</em>, Gu Fei is
        even attending a school match.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei was too lazy to respond to him, so he remained silent.</p>

      <p>
        “That’s fine, I’ve always been easy to talk to.” Hou Zi held a cigarette
        as he used a finger to jab at his chest a few times, “The night after
        tomorrow at 8:00 o’clock at the old building by the railway bridge.
        Let’s play something fair.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei shot him a look and Liu Fan who stood at the side took a step
        forward, seemingly agitated. He stretched out his arm to block him:
        “Alright.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hurdling,” Hou Zi said. “Everyone is responsible for the consequences
        of their own actions.”
      </p>

      <p>“Fine,” Gu Fei agreed.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck!” Liu Fan smacked the steering wheel as soon as he got in the car,
        “Why the hell did you agree to hurdling? Can’t you beat the shit out of
        him?”
      </p>

      <p>“This has to be settled eventually,” Ge Fei responded.</p>

      <p>
        “Settle it with a fucking fight! The fuck you hurdling for?!” Luo Yu
        roared from the back.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Do you actually think that he’d possibly agree to a fight?” Gu Fei
        turned back to look at Luo Yu, “If he wanted to settle things with just
        a fight, then he would have done so a long time ago. Would he have
        needed to wait this long?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Then let him continue to wait <em>ah</em>!” Liu Fan yelled, “He doesn’t
        have the balls to mess with you, so what difference does it make if you
        ignored him…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What if he has a hidden agenda?” Gu Fei interrupted him, “What if he
        looks for someone else? What if he messes with Gu Miao?”
      </p>

      <p>Everybody in the car all fell silent.</p>

      <p>
        “Plus, I’m tired of it all.” Gu Fei twisted his brows as he tugged at
        his clothes. The clothes coagulated with blood suddenly ripped open, and
        he almost cried out, “Even if I’m stuck here for my entire life, I still
        want to feel some sort of stability as I stay here. I don’t want to
        spend the rest of my life in a struggle for life all the time.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s not talk about him anymore,” Li Yan spoke up. “He’s already
        agreed to it, so saying any of this right now is pointless. If this
        problem can be resolved, then just resolve it <em>ba</em>. It’s not like
        you could die. You’ll just end up staying in the hospital for a few
        months at worst…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who said it’s impossible to die?! Haven’t you seen the news?! Two days
        ago somebody died from tripping and falling flat on their face!” Liu Fan
        stared straight into Li Yan’s eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck! I’ll spit on your whole family!” Li Yan grew anxious and glared
        back at him, “Hurry up and spit! Idiot!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Liu Fan paused for a quite some time then finally slapped the steering
        wheel: “<em>Pei, pei, pei.</em>”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei tilted his head to look out the window and laughed for some time:
        “Idiots.”
      </p>

      <p>
        As Jiang Cheng stood inside Gu Fei’s family shop and watched Gu Fei’s
        mother, who was nibbling on melon seeds behind the checkout counter, he
        felt both standing and walking would be awkward.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Sit down <em>bei</em>,” Gu Fei’s mother said. “He’s usually always back
        at the shop around mealtimes.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I…” Jiang Cheng didn’t want to sit down at all. He pointed at the door,
        intending to say, ‘I’ll go take a walk outside.’
      </p>

      <p>
        But before he could even utter those words, Gu Fei’s mother glanced at
        the clock on the side and waved her hands at him: “<em>Aiyo</em>, I
        wasn’t paying attention to the time. I have to go out now. Good thing
        you’re here. I don’t need to lock the shop then. Keep an eye on the
        place<em> ba</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>“Huh?” Jiang Cheng froze.</p>

      <p>
        “Just help check people out. Li Yan does it all day long <em>ne</em>,”
        Gu Fei’s mother said while putting on her coat. “Don’t tell me you don’t
        even know to check people out?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wanted to say that he really didn’t know how, but before he
        could open his mouth, Gu Fei’s mother had already dashed out of the shop
        like a gust of wind. He stood stunned in place inside the shop for a
        long while, his mind in a chaotic mess, before finally sitting down
        behind the checkout counter after some time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whatever Gu Fei was doing that took an entire afternoon, he didn’t know.
        But he knew for sure that it definitely had nothing to do with Gu Miao.
        He had asked when he came by and Gu Miao was at home drawing
        <em>ne</em>.
      </p>

      <p>He was almost certain that Gu Fei had gone to the zoo.</p>

      <p>
        But where was such a place where both basketball could be played and
        fights could break out – no one knew. The only person in the class who
        he could ask was Wang Xu but Wang Xu didn’t know, and if he didn’t know,
        then it was even more impossible for anyone else to know. Aside from the
        students in the class, Ding Zhuxin was the only other person that he
        could inquire, but Ding Zhuxin didn’t give him an answer.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What he refuses to tell you, I can’t tell you even if I know it.” Ding
        Zhuxin very warmly replied yet didn’t give him a chance to further
        question in detail.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took out his phone and just like that, he sat behind the
        checkout counter in a daze, unable to pinpoint exactly how he was
        feeling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Anxiety, he had already felt. Fury, he had also already felt. The only
        thing that remained of the anger that persistently burned till now was
        depression – the sort of depression that wouldn’t dissolve if he didn’t
        beat the shit out of Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        After being stuck in a daze for almost twenty minutes, he heard the
        sound of a car outside the shop and walked over to stand in front of the
        wind curtain, taking a look outside.
      </p>

      <p>
        A Benni that looked as though it would fall apart if it moved another
        ten meters stopped at the door. The windows were closed, and the people
        inside couldn’t be seen, but after the car stopped, Gu Fei got out of
        the passenger seat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was initially still wondering if maybe Gu Fei really did
        have something else to do and it was him who might have thought too
        much, but when he saw the bloodstain on the collar of Gu Fei’s shirt,
        who was making his way over here, his anger sharply rose. It was as if
        there was a welding torch in his body that was burning through his
        skull, turning him into a human torch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei probably didn’t expect for there to be people standing behind the
        wind curtain so the second he lifted it and walked in, he directly
        collided into Jiang Cheng’s body.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>!” Gu Fei was startled, but just as he thought of stepping
        back, he was grabbed by Jiang Cheng on the collar of his jacket.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What were you doing?” Jiang Cheng grabbed his collar and dragged him
        into the shop before pressing him against the wall next to him. “Tell
        me, what the fuck did you go to do?!”
      </p>

      <p>“Why are you here?” Gu Fei had a dumbstruck expression.</p>

      <p>“I asked what you went to do!” Jiang Cheng roared.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei grabbed his wrist and tried to pull it away but didn’t succeed.
        He could only give up and sighed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How about I give you five seconds to make up a story <em>ah</em>!”
        Jiang Cheng’s gaze bored into him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I can’t make it up even if you give me another ten seconds,” Gu Fei
        said. “It’s too sudden.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t speak. After staring at him for a while, he suddenly
        loosened his hand, turned around, lifted the curtain, and walked out of
        the shop.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei frowned and knocked his head against the wall. After a two-second
        pause, he chased after him: “Jiang Cheng!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was walking back in the direction of his rental place with
        swinging arms. He didn’t look back nor did his steps show any sign of
        slowing down.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>,” Gu Fei chased after and grabbed his arm,
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>, my ass!” Jiang Cheng swung his arm off and turned to
        glare at him, “I don’t have a son like you!”
      </p>

      <p>“I said <em>Ge</em>,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was stunned, but anyone could see that his anger was quickly
        rekindling. He pointed a finger at Gu Fei: “It’s fucking useless even if
        you call me Grandpa!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei hesitated for a moment before grabbing his arm once more and,
        with a turn of his head, he dragged him back in the shop.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck?” Jiang Cheng was dumbstruck. He firmly swung his arm a couple
        of times but was unable to shake off his hands. Just as he was thinking
        of putting in more effort, he caught sight of the bloodstain on Gu Fei’s
        collar again and clenched his teeth because of him for the third time
        that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        In that moment of hesitation, Gu Fei successfully dragged him back
        inside the shop.
      </p>

      <p>“Let’s talk,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Talk about what?” Jiang Cheng suddenly felt like all his strength had
        scattered the moment Gu Fei released his arm. The anger within him also
        suddenly stopped surging. He leaned back against the wall, “Talk about
        how you deceived me?”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at him. In addition to the bloodstain on his collar,
        there was also a bloodstain slightly above his waist. “First, take care
        of your injuries <em>ba</em>. This garish appearance of yours… those who
        don’t know would think that somebody flogged you.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t appear very different from normal, so he didn’t think that
        he was seriously injured. But when he took off his jacket, Jiang Cheng
        ended up frowning when he caught sight of the t-shirt that was torn on
        the right side of his waist.
      </p>

      <p>“Was this from the game?” He asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei tossed his jacket to the side and glanced at him, “You
        haven’t eaten yet, right?”
      </p>

      <p>“I don’t have any appetite,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>
        “I’m a little hungry though.” Gu Fei took out his phone, “I’ll order two
        bowls of rice, so how about you just try to eat some?”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng didn’t respond.</p>

      <p>
        “Stir-fried green pepper and beef,” Gu Fei read off his phone. “What do
        you want to order? There’s braised beef with potatoes, stir-fried tomato
        and scrambled eggs, braised eggplant…”
      </p>

      <p>“Stir-fried tomato and scrambled eggs.” Jiang Cheng sighed.</p>

      <p>
        After Gu Fei ordered the takeaway, he took out a first-aid kit from the
        small cabinet next to him. He snuck a glance at Jiang Cheng and
        hesitated for a few seconds before he raised his arms and stripped
        himself of his t-shirt.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh shit.” Jiang Cheng was given a fright when he saw the two large
        gashes on his shoulder and waist, “Why didn’t you just let them beat you
        to death <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Who can beat me to death?” Gu Fei laughed as he went inside the small
        room.
      </p>

      <p>“… do you need some help?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“Thanks,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Does thanks fucking mean that you need it or not <em>ah</em>?” Jiang
        Cheng retorted as he stood.
      </p>

      <p>“Need.” Gu Fei turned his head back to look at him.</p>

      <p>
        There were only two wounds on his body and it actually wasn’t too bad.
        Jiang Cheng entered the small room and made his way closer to inspect
        the wounds more carefully. He noticed that the edges of the wounds were
        very irregular, meaning that the tool that caused the wounds was a
        really blunt one, so the gashes were basically made by tearing his skin
        open – it felt painful just imagining it.
      </p>

      <p>
        He opened the first-aid kit and took out the alcohol. After mulling over
        it for some time, he finally asked, “Was it Hou Zi? That… brass knuckle
        of his?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Damn.” Gu Fei gawked at him, a little surprised, “You can even tell
        this? A xueba also has this sort of affiliative ability… it wasn’t Hou
        Zi, but Jiang Bin.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I just guessed.” Jiang Cheng held a sterilized cotton ball in one hand
        and the bottle of alcohol in the other. He stared at Gu Fei’s wound as
        he contemplated on how to go about cleaning up such a large wound.
        Dabbing it with an alcohol-dipped cotton… would take forever for a gash
        as long as this. Plus, just attempting a couple of postures was already
        tiring. “How about we go next door to take care of it?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I refuse. The moment it’s the afternoon or evening, there would be a
        bunch of uncles and aunts getting amino acid drips next door. It’s
        basically a gossip story newsroom at this time. If I were to go there
        now, everyone around here would know that I’ve been hacked and even
        practically hacked to death.” Gu Fei groaned, “The wound isn’t even that
        serious. Just casually disinfect it, stick on a gauze, and it’ll be
        fine.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng sounded in response.</p>

      <p>
        “Just…” Before Gu Fei could finish speaking, Jiang Cheng had already
        raised his hand and poured the alcohol on the wound on his shoulder. He
        froze for two seconds before he gave a sharp inhale, “What the fuck?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I should get a bottle of saline solution… must hurt a lot, huh?” Jiang
        Cheng looked at him.
      </p>

      <p>“What do you think?” Gu Fei’s eyebrows were twisted into a knot.</p>

      <p>
        “The pain from the alcohol will pass very soon.” Jiang Cheng blew at his
        wound a couple of times, “I just wanted to give it a good rinse.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… oh.” Gu Fei peered at the wound, “You’ve finished rinsing now,
        right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng rummaged through the first-aid kit again and fished
        out a bottle of medical iodine, “It should be fine after we use this to
        disinfect it one more time.”
      </p>

      <p>“Are you going to pour that on as well?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Of course,” Jiang Cheng nodded. “It’s such a large wound. Just how long
        do you think it’ll take if we slowly dab it with a cotton ball
        <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>“You’re pretty damn carefree.” Gu Fei growled.</p>

      <p>
        “You went seeking for death, yet you still want to lie comfortably in
        bed. If you have the ability, then don’t get hurt <em>ah</em>.” Jiang
        Cheng then proceeded to also pour the iodine on after he finished
        speaking, then used the cotton ball to dab at it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “To tell you the truth… it’s not that I didn’t want to take you with
        me.” Gu Fei leaned against the wall and raised his arm to let him treat
        the wound on his waist. “It’s mainly that… this matter… has nothing to
        do with you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng knew what Gu Fei meant and it was also something he
        could guess. Jiang Bin was looking for someone to vent his anger on
        after losing the game, however, the one backing him up was Hou Zi who
        didn’t see eye-to-eye with Gu Fei. “But I’m just the fuse. If you didn’t
        insist on shouldering this matter for me, Hou Zi might’ve not been able
        to cause you trouble.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei kept silent. Since he had bumped into Jiang Cheng the moment he
        came back, let alone making up an excuse, he didn’t even have the chance
        to go over what had just happened.
      </p>

      <p>
        But he was all verklempt because of Jiang Cheng. Just like this, Jiang
        Cheng was able to quickly figure out the truth of the matter based only
        on that small amount of information – he was truly deserving of being
        called a xueba. With such a meticulous mind for logic, he might as well
        study the sciences.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You being like this makes me feel shameless.” Jiang Cheng took the
        bottle of alcohol and dumped it on his waist. “I…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>!” Gu Fei couldn’t hold back a yell, “Can’t you give a
        warning first before you just dump it on?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I can.” Jiang Cheng shot him a glance, “<em>Yo</em>~ I’m about to dump
        it on for the second time now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You…” Gu Fei’s words were cut short when Jiang Cheng dumped the alcohol
        on the wound once more. He took a deep breath, “You’re retaliating,
        aren’t you?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “All set.” Jiang Cheng used the cotton to give a couple dabs, “I got
        prescribed two bottles of tissue adhesive or something when I went to
        the hospital last time. I’ll give you one tomorrow, you’ll heal faster
        if you use that.”
      </p>

      <p>“… en,” Gu Fei sounded in response.</p>

      <p>
        Even though Jiang Cheng never touched him during the whole process, just
        the slightly painful touch brought by the cotton on the wound was enough
        to make that side of his body a little numb and weak. But once the
        alcohol settled, whatever unsavory ideas he had were instantly expelled
        from his mind – he was now pure of heart and limited in his desires.<a
          href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        After gauze was properly placed over the wound, the person delivering
        the food arrived. Jiang Cheng went to bring in the two sets of rice with
        meat and vegetables while Gu Fei set up a small table and sat down.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was only then that he could finally feel all the tension that had
        accumulated in the afternoon slowly subside.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This restaurant,” Jiang Cheng opened his container of food and gave it
        a long, hard stare. “Will definitely close this year.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Huh?” Gu Fei opened his own share and looked at it – it smelled pretty
        good.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Every time I see this type of stir-fried tomato and scrambled egg with
        tomatoes that are cut bigger than a face and an egg that was split into
        eight portions when scrambled,” Jiang Cheng said. “I would always say
        this same sentence.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei stared at the stir-fried tomato and scrambled eggs in his
        container before bursting into a laughing fit that he couldn’t hold
        back. After a long time did he finally manage to stop himself. He then
        pushed his portion of stir-fried green pepper and beef over: “Wanna
        switch?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s no need.” Jiang Cheng took a look at his container, “Just based
        on this stir-fried green pepper and beef made from a green pepper that’s
        only sliced once and a piece of beef that has been split eighty times,
        this restaurant will close down this year.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed as he ate. Jiang Cheng didn’t say anymore after that,
        just lowered his head and began to eat with a gloomy expression.
      </p>

      <p>
        After eating in silence for several minutes, Gu Fei lifted his head and
        put down his chopsticks: “Sorry, I didn’t mean to lie to you.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng remained silent. He stared at the piece of tomato between
        his chopsticks and after a while, he finally put it in his mouth: “Has
        the matter been settled?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei hesitated for a moment: “I arranged a time with Hou Zi the day
        after tomorrow. When our match is over.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looked up at him.</p>

      <p>
        “It really is a matter just between Hou Zi and I this time,” Gu Fei
        said. “It doesn’t matter whether or not you’re the one to start the
        fire, it was always going to explode. I might as well settle both
        problems at once.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t respond and simply lowered his head, continuing to
        eat.
      </p>

      <p>
        The food was utterly unpalatable; the tomato juice sauteed out, the eggs
        were too sparse, and the rice was too mushy. His chopsticks came to a
        halt after he had only eaten half of it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you can’t eat it anymore then put it on the stand in the backyard.”
        Gu Fei on the other hand downed it very quickly; one could already see
        the bottom of his container. “Some stray cats will come by to eat ‘em.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng got up and took the half-full container of food to the
        backyard then set it on the stand. He stood there and waited a bit, but
        no cats came into his line of sight, so he went back into the shop. “I
        didn’t see any cats.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The one that usually comes by is pretty timid so if someone’s there, it
        won’t come out.” Gu Fei threw away the empty container, put away the
        table, and lit a cigarette as he leaned against the checkout counter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sat on the chair and took out his phone, swiping back and
        forth on it aimlessly.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I know you’re upset that I didn’t call you along today.” Gu Fei held
        the cigarette in his mouth and stared down at his shoes. “If it was only
        Jiang Bin, I would’ve brought you along. But Hou Zi was there… so I
        thought ‘nevermind’.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng glanced at him.</p>

      <p>
        “There are some things that are best avoided if you can, and best not to
        take part in if you don’t have to.” Gu Fei let out a puff of smoke,
        “It’s too troublesome.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Jiang Cheng sounded.</p>

      <p>
        “That day, you asked me why I didn’t go to a technical high school or
        something.” Gu Fei looked at him, “Wanna hear about it?”
      </p>

      <p>“Alright.” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei went to close the door of the shop and pulled down the shutters.
        He then grabbed a chair and sat opposite of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “In the past, I was kind of…” Gu Fei fell silent for a while before
        finally continuing, “In elementary school, I used to always… get into
        fights. Even now, my elementary school classmates would still take
        detours when they see me on the street.”
      </p>

      <p>“School tyrant <em>ah</em>.” Jiang Cheng gazed at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Anyway, basically… I was beaten by my dad at home, and so I beat others
        when I went out.” Gu Fei gave a bitter laugh, “I didn’t like to talk
        much at that time, so I would always use my fists for every little
        thing. If I injured someone and they came to our door for compensation,
        my dad would beat the shit out of me again.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng softly sighed.</p>

      <p>
        “During First Year, I pushed my deskmate out of the second-floor
        classroom window.” Gu Fei stretched his long legs and directed his gaze
        at the tips of his feet. “Actually, my dad had also thrown me out the
        window before, but I didn’t sustain many injuries…”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng stared at him in surprise but said nothing.</p>

      <p>
        “But that kid was injured pretty seriously. His arms, legs, and ribs
        were all broken. The school went to look for my mother… my dad had just
        died at the time,” Gu Fei said in a low voice. “The school had already
        thought that it wasn’t suitable for me to remain in a regular junior
        high school due to my circumstances, and with the addition of that
        matter, they suggested that I go to a reformatory school<a href="#_ftn2"
          >[2]</a
        >.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What kind of school is a reformatory school?” Jiang Cheng asked, but
        seeing that Gu Fei seemed a bit out of sorts, he lowered his head and
        checked on his phone instead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reformatory school – a special educational school established by the
        People’s Republic of China for minors who had committed minor violations
        of the law or other criminal activities and does not fall within the
        scope of administrative sanctions or penalties.
      </p>

      <p>“What the fuck?” Jiang Cheng froze.</p>

      <p>
        “Many of those places have been shut down already.” Gu Fei lightly
        swayed his foot, “The one that I had gone to was also changed to a
        technical school later on. There weren’t that many students when I was
        there.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng muttered, not knowing what else to say.</p>

      <p>
        “In fact, the Principal had also recommended my mother to take me to see
        a psychiatrist at the time since. They thought that I had serious
        violent tendencies or something.” Gu Fei threw the cigarette butt on the
        ground and put it out with a step of his shoes. He then felt for another
        cigarette and lit it. “But my mom refused. With Er Miao the way she is,
        she couldn’t bear to hear anyone say that I also had a problem… so I
        went to the reformatory school.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Were all the students that went there like you?” Jiang Cheng asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Someone like me could already be considered a good kid there.” Gu Fei
        smirked, “Having stayed with those reform-school students, I finally
        knew what it meant to be beyond redemption. You can’t even imagine what
        it was like… they were only teenagers, how bad could they be? I was only
        there for a year and a half, but I never want to have any contact with
        them again for the rest of my life.”
      </p>

      <p>“Give me… a cigarette,” Jiang Cheng requested.</p>

      <p>
        “You ran out again?” Gu Fei fished out the cigarette box, “Just directly
        take some from the counter next time you run out.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I just happen to not have any, that’s all.” Jiang Cheng took out a
        cigarette and lit it. His head felt a bit muddled.
      </p>

      <p>
        In fact, he could pretty much already imagine what kind of past Gu Fei
        had from looking at his usual demeanor, but he didn’t expect it to be
        that serious. Just the matter of him “killing” his father took him a
        long time to digest, and now he felt like his firmware had been replaced
        for the second time – his head was buzzing.
      </p>

      <p>“I seemed to have digressed,” Gu Fei murmured.</p>

      <p>
        “Ah.” Jiang Cheng looked at him but still hadn’t returned to his senses.
      </p>

      <p>
        Being thrown down from the second floor by his own father was something
        he had a hard time accepting and throwing his deskmate out of the
        second-floor window was something he was equally shocked by.
      </p>

      <p>
        “A classroom on the second is higher than the second floor of a
        residential building <em>ah</em>,” He uttered.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Huh?” Gu Fei was stunned. Only after a long time did he finally realize
        what he was talking about. He then suddenly tilted his head back and
        started to laugh, “Cheng-<em>ge,</em> I find that your ability to grasp
        the main idea is quite strong <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Haha, very funny.” Jiang Cheng had kept the cigarette between his
        fingers after lighting it, and it was only then did he remember to take
        a drag. “You digressed? What was the previous topic?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “In the second half of the Third Year of junior high, the school was
        converted to a technical high school. After we graduated, everyone
        basically remained there and attended the ‘technical’ high school,” Gu
        Fei continued, “But I still wanted to go to a regular high school. I
        really didn’t want to stay with them anymore. I never want to cross
        paths with them ever again in this lifetime.”
      </p>

      <p>“So you tested into Si Zhong?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei nodded, “Si Zhong is a lousy school, it’s considerably easy
        to get in.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng went silent. After taking two drags of the cigarette, he
        gave a long sigh. He suddenly didn’t know what else he could say.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>.” Gu Fei got up and took out a bottle of beer from
        the freezer. He opened it with his teeth and took a couple of sips.
        “You’re different from the people here. You have no idea how troublesome
        things can be if these people are provoked.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “If you fight and lose, someone will think that you’re easy to bully.
        But if you win, someone will think of you as an eyesore. They’ll always
        cling to you no matter what you do.” Gu Fei said, “These people, it’s
        better to stay as far as possible from them. Do you understand what I
        mean?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “…en.” Jiang Cheng closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and slowly
        exhaled.
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re not Wang Xu, or Jiang Bin, and you’re definitely not Hou Zi.
        You’re an outstanding student,” Gu Fei stated, “Attend your classes,
        learn what you need to learn, and then take your exams. Go to the school
        that you want to go to. Don’t let yourself get involved in these
        things.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng silently snubbed out his cigarette. He rubbed his hands on
        his face a few times and leaned back against the chair.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The reason why I didn’t let you go isn’t because I wanted to shoulder
        something for you,” Gu Fei said. “I was just afraid that you’d be stuck
        here. I wouldn’t give a damn if it was anyone else because no one has
        ever said to me ‘I won’t let myself rot here’ before. You’re the only
        person to have said this, and since you’ve said it, you have to achieve
        it. Don’t think that I’ve helped you with anything and don’t talk to me
        about loyalty or something either.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng still didn’t speak. He abruptly stood up, walked up to Gu
        Fei, and caressed his head.
      </p>

      <p>
        “… if it was someone else who touched my head like this, I would beat
        the crap out of them.” Gu Fei raised his head to shoot him a look.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng touched his head a couple times again.</p>

      <p>“Shit.” Gu Fei started to laugh.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng moved a hand to the back of his head and hugged it.</p>

      <p>
        “What are you doing?” Gu Fei’s face was practically buried against his
        stomach, so he could only ask with a stuffy voice.
      </p>

      <p>“Don’t talk,” Jiang Cheng demanded.</p>

      <p>“I need to breathe,” Gu Fei mumbled.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng completely ignored him and held on for a few more seconds
        before eventually letting him go. He fell back onto his chair and looked
        at Gu Fei, suddenly feeling exhilarated as he peered at him and burst
        into a fit of laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei picked up the beer, intending to drink it, but after raising the
        bottle to his mouth and stopping two or three times before he could
        drink from it, he put the bottle on the ground and also started to laugh
        along with him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “As for me,” Jiang Cheng said with a smile. “I’m actually a very serious
        person.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Me too.” Gu Fei took a huge gulp of the beer and managed to suppress
        his laughter, “I hope you won’t misunderstand me.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng nodded, then continued to laugh for a while longer
        before his breathing finally evened out. He then let out a long sigh and
        paused for some time before finally asking, “Can you tell me how you and
        Hou Zi are going to settle things?”
      </p>

      <p>“What are you asking this for?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “If a fight is used to settle things, then he definitely can’t beat
        you,” Jiang Cheng replied, “You definitely wouldn’t be singled out. When
        Wang Xu and I were held up by them last time, he was still willing to
        give you some face, so he won’t be getting a bunch of people to gang up
        on you, right?”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Gu Fei laughed some more.</p>

      <p>
        “So how are you guys going to settle this?” Jiang Cheng stared straight
        into Gu Fei’s eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        As Gu Fei maintained eye contact with him, he seemed to hesitate before
        he finally whispered two syllables: “Hurdling.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the hell is that?” Jiang Cheng looked at him with an inexplicable
        gaze.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s the insider rules of the people in the area around the steel
        mills.” Gu Fei explained, “It’s the generally acknowledged method to
        settle issues.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “How are you going to hurdle? How are you going to jump?” Jiang Cheng
        questioned again.
      </p>

      <p>“Did you change your idol recently?” Gu Fei took a gulp of beer.</p>

      <p>“What?” Jiang Cheng froze.</p>

      <p>
        “Wasn’t Xiao Ming’s grandfather your idol before?” Gu Fei asked, “He’s
        not anymore?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… fuck off.” Jiang Cheng felt around in his pocket and fished out the
        cigarette box, then he took out a cigarette and held it in his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just when he was about to light the cigarette, Gu Fei sighed, “You still
        have some, yet you took mine?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En?” Jiang Cheng looked at the cigarette in his hand – indeed, he
        really did have some – he was probably out of his mind a while ago.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stared at his cigarettes for a while before he took out the one in
        his mouth and put it back in the box. Pocketing it again, he stretched
        his hand out toward Gu Fei: “Give me one.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Speechless, Gu Fei grabbed his own cigarette box and tossed it into his
        hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How will you guys be hurdling?” Jiang Cheng asked again as he took out
        a cigarette but didn’t light it.
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s a railway bridge past the shop where you bought your bike,” Gu
        Fei explained. “Next to it is an old neighborhood where the factories
        had relocated. Someone bought that area a while back, but they still
        haven’t moved forward with any developments yet. The buildings there are
        all dilapidated…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Jiang Cheng interrupted him before he could finish, “Jumping off
        the buildings?”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei gazed at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Jumping from one building to the next?” Jiang Cheng looked fixedly at
        him, “Right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Gu Fei sounded in response. “Jump until someone is injured or
        quits.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is the air quality in this area around the steel mills a little too bad
        <em>ah</em>? Has the lack of oxygen impeded your IQs?” Jiang Cheng was
        left utterly unable to describe his own feelings. “Why don’t you just
        say that you have to jump until someone falls to their death?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Normally, no one is able to die since the distance isn’t that wide,” Gu
        Fei replied with a smile.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Morons.” Jiang Cheng gripped the lighter and pressed down on it several
        times without actually being able to light the cigarette. As soon as the
        fire got close, it was blown out by the air exhaled from his nose.
        Finally, he chucked both the lighter and the cigarette to the stool
        sitting at the side. “There are actually such brainless people in this
        world! It really is eye-opening!”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei took the cigarette and lit it, then handed it to him.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng shot him a look before reaching out to take it and put it in
        his mouth.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two remained quiet as silence overtook the shop. Not even a sound
        could be heard from the street outside – all Jiang Cheng could hear was
        the sound of his own exhales
      </p>

      <p>
        He wanted to get angry for no particular reason. It wasn’t toward Gu
        Fei, nor was it toward Hou Zi… he didn’t know who it was towards or what
        he was specifically angry about, his anger was just simmering.
      </p>

      <p>
        He raised his eyes and glared at Gu Fei who gazed back at him calmly.
      </p>

      <p>His heart suddenly started to hurt for him.</p>

      <p>
        Because of those chaotic, dark things that he had never thought of
        before and always felt out of reach towards, Gu Fei suddenly went from
        his teammate that he shared a tacit understanding with and a deskmate
        that he shared unspeakable secrets with to a shadow that he felt
        somewhat unable to grasp.
      </p>

      <p>His heart really hurt for him.</p>

      <p>
        The cigarette was quickly finished in that period of silence. It wasn’t
        pleasant to smoke at all – a little uncomfortable actually, and even his
        throat was dry.
      </p>

      <p>
        He snubbed out the cigarette and stretched out his hand in front of Gu
        Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at his hand, probably not knowing what he wanted to do. He
        hesitated for a while before he finally placed his own hand on Jiang
        Cheng’s.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng grasped it tightly and squeezed it hard for a while before
        letting it go.
      </p>

      <p>
        “When is it? When you guys are going do those brain-ischemic jumps off
        the buildings?” Jiang Cheng asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        “After the finals.” Gu Fei rubbed his hand that was a little pale from
        his grasp.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I want to go watch.” Jiang Cheng announced. Gu Fei wanted to say
        something, but he waved his hand to interrupt him, “I won’t let anyone
        know that I’m there. I just want to see.”
      </p>

      <p>“See what?” Gu Fei asked a bit helplessly.</p>

      <p>
        “See what kind of person you are,” Jiang Cheng peered at him, “I want to
        clearly see for myself what kind of person you are.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        The two of them sat in the shop in silence. Jiang Cheng couldn’t tell
        what Gu Fei was thinking, but he knew for sure that he himself wasn’t
        thinking of anything – he was just stunned. His mind was churning but he
        didn’t know what it was even churning about.
      </p>

      <p>
        When it almost reached 9:00 o’clock, Gu Fei stood up from his seat:
        “Let’s go. Do you want me to take you back?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng also stood up. He froze for a while before asking,
        “Take me? Why do you need to take me?”
      </p>

      <p>“In case you get lost again <em>ah</em>,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Jiang Cheng burst out laughing, “Now, I can go back even with my
        eyes closed.”
      </p>

      <p>“You’re so <em>amazing</em>~.” Gu Fei put on his jacket.</p>

      <p>
        “I’ve always been incredibly amazing,” Jiang Cheng retorted, following
        him out of the shop.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s house was in the same direction as the apartment that Jiang
        Cheng rented. They would pass by the intersection by Gu Fei’s house
        first and then the apartment that Jiang Cheng rented would only be a
        little ways forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        The two remained silent as they rode their bikes back together. Jiang
        Cheng had a constant urge to say something, but there didn’t seem to be
        anything he could talk about so he could only continue staring at the
        road ahead.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they passed by the intersection by Gu Fei’s house, Gu Fei didn’t
        make a turn. Jiang Cheng noticed this but didn’t point it out, and the
        two rode until they reached the rental apartment before stopping.
      </p>

      <p>“Are you going to school tomorrow?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “I’m going,” Gu Fei replied. “Didn’t Captain Wang want to have a
        practice from noon to afternoon?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That injury of yours.” Jiang Cheng shot him a look, “Will it be okay
        when we go against Class 2?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t worry.” Gu Fei gave the injury on his waist a few pats, “It won’t
        affect anything. Plus, Class 2 is pretty ethical when they play.”
      </p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p>
        The conversation had ended but neither of them made a move; Jiang Cheng
        didn’t get off his bike and head inside the corridor, and nor did Gu Fei
        turn around and head back.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a period of silence, Jiang Cheng cleared his throat: “Then… I’ll
        head up now.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei sounded.</p>

      <p>
        Yet even after that exchange, still neither of them moved. Both remained
        straddling their bikes, with a leg supporting them on the ground as if
        they had been cemented in place.
      </p>

      <p>
        After another period of time, Gu Fei finally spoke up again: “Just head
        up. I’m going now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng finally moved. He led the bike along the sidewalk,
        “Goodnight.”
      </p>

      <p>“Goodnight,” Gu Fei echoed.</p>

      <p>
        After Jiang Cheng pushed the bike into the corridor and properly locked
        it away, he glanced back to see that Gu Fei was still in the same place.
        After seeing this, Gu Fei gave him a wave before he pedaled the bike,
        made a turn, and left.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng returned to the apartment and took a shower before he sat
        himself at the desk and took a look at that day’s homework – he was
        unexpectedly unable to understand a thing even after staring at it for a
        long time.
      </p>

      <p>
        With that evening event, adding onto the afternoon he already had that
        day, he felt like his brain had absorbed a little too much shock. All
        sorts of things were stuffed into a chaotic mess that practically filled
        his head to the brim – there basically wasn’t any room remaining for the
        information contained in his homework.
      </p>

      <p>
        It took at least ten minutes for him to finally calm down and start
        working on his homework.
      </p>

      <p>His phone sounded – Pan Zhi had sent a message.</p>

      <p>
        – The materials that I sent to you are being delivered so remember to
        pay attention to any calls <em>ah</em>. Didn’t you change your address?
        Is it far?
      </p>

      <p>– Not that far. Send me the courier number.</p>

      <p>Pan Zhi then sent over the courier number.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng checked the delivery man’s phone number, intending to tell
        them to not make an on-door delivery and that he would just pick it up
        himself. He really didn’t want to go to the street where Li Baoguo’s
        place was ever again… he didn’t know how to deal with Li Baoguo if he
        were to ever bump into him.
      </p>

      <p>
        – Also, there’s a USB in there. I’ve made a copy of all the coursework
        that our teachers are using for the semester on there. Take a look and
        see if they’re useful <em>ba</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at the message. If Pan Zhi were by his side right
        then, he would have definitely gone up to him and give him a big hug.
        <em>What a filial grandson</em> <em>ah</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        He picked up his phone and took a selfie with his thumbs raised. Then he
        photoshopped some garish images on it before sending it to Pan Zhi.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pan Zhi didn’t reply to him for a long time after that so he put his
        phone aside. He felt like his brain had finally managed to make a little
        room, thus he sat down and started to actually work on his homework.
      </p>

      <p>
        Si Zhong’s homework wasn’t even a lot – his sleep wouldn’t be delayed
        even if he had only started working on it at that time – however, it
        actually caused him to feel a little uneasy. He considered whether or
        not he should let Pan Zhi send him a copy of his homework everyday too…
      </p>

      <p>
        After working on it for almost an hour, his phone sounded – a message
        had come.
      </p>

      <p>He picked it up and took a look.</p>

      <p>
        – That selfie of yours could be named “Thank god, I’m handsome”. I’ll
        send you some of the pictures I took before in two days so please don’t
        take anymore selfies.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng froze. When he finally came back to his senses, he hurriedly
        took a look at the name at the top.
      </p>

      <p>小兔子乖乖 – Gently little bunny!<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a></p>

      <p>
        “Fuck?!” He was shocked stiff. He swiped two more times on the screen
        before he was finally sure that he actually sent the picture he meant to
        send to Pan Zhi to Gu Fei!
      </p>

      <p>– Fuck, how did I send that to you?????</p>

      <p>– Who did you want to send that to?</p>

      <p>– To my friend!</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t immediately reply. After Jiang Cheng resent the photo to
        Pan Zhi, he then finally received another message.
      </p>

      <p>– Send this one to your friend <em>ba</em>.</p>

      <p>
        There was even a photo beneath the message. When Jiang Cheng suddenly
        saw his face that pretty much took up the entire screen, he was
        instantly overwhelmed with embarrassment.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was the close-up taken by Gu Fei when he had a wound on his lips that
        day.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the side was a somewhat idiotic-looking row of words that glowed:
        <em>Me and my stubborn wound.</em>
      </p>

      <p>– Fuck! What’s wrong with you??</p>

      <p>He sent a message back to Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>
        – It’s much better than that selfie of yours. I photoshopped it with
        such painstaking care.
      </p>

      <p>– Scram!</p>

      <p>– How ungrateful!</p>

      <p>– So what if I’m ungrateful??</p>

      <p>–【Fuck him up!.jpg】<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a><sup></sup></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng burst into a laughing fit as he stared at the picture Gu Fei
        sent over before he finally replied again:
      </p>

      <p>– I’m doing my fucking homework rn.</p>

      <p>– Good luck, <em>xueba</em>~.</p>

      <p>
        When he got up the next day, Jiang Cheng felt his head was a little
        heavy. He sat at the edge of his bed in a daze for several minutes, yet
        he was unable to recall the chaotic dreams he had last night.
      </p>

      <p>
        He could only remember that there were Gu Fei, a zoo, and Pan Zhi and
        Wang Xu who had made guest appearances – the whole thing was uproarious.
      </p>

      <p>He sighed before standing up to wash his face.</p>

      <p>
        Perhaps it was because a night had already passed. But now that he
        thought again about the things Gu Fei had talked about, the stuff from
        his childhood, and the “fair duel” between him and Hou Zi, there was no
        longer an unacceptable feeling of shock. Rather, everything seemed to
        have become a little unreal to him as if it was all just a very vivid
        dream.
      </p>

      <p>
        After buying breakfast downstairs, Jiang Cheng slowly rode his bike to
        school with the handlebar in one hand and nibbling a deep-fried dough
        cake with the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        The weather really was growing warmer; he was already halfway through
        the deep-fried dough cake, yet it still hadn’t cooled yet…
      </p>

      <p>
        When he passed the intersection, he squeezed the brakes. However, he
        didn’t hear Gu Fei’s whistle. He turned his head to the sides and looked
        around but didn’t see Gu Fei waiting for him by the road.
      </p>

      <p>
        He sighed. At this time, if there wasn’t a special reason, then Gu Fei
        must have not gotten out of bed yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were still a few minutes before class when he arrived at school.
        Jiang Cheng parked his bike in the parking lot and walked towards the
        school gates.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he was only a little over a dozen meters away, he abruptly stopped
        in his steps.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu was on duty this week; he was standing in front of the gates at
        that moment, and before him was another person.
      </p>

      <p>Li Baoguo.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng suddenly felt a burst of irritation and panic. After staying
        rooted in place for a few seconds, he lowered his head, crossed the
        street, and took a detour around the school gates, and ran towards the
        enclosure at the front of the school.
      </p>

      <p>
        The place that Gu Fei told him last time where he could climb over the
        wall was actually pretty easy to find.
      </p>

      <p>
        The campus’ small shop had just opened and when he climbed up the wall,
        the boss who so happened to be sweeping the ground gaped at him in
        shock. “Kid, the bell hasn’t even rung yet. The school gates are still
        open.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I… know.” Jiang Cheng used a hand to pull himself up as he stared back
        at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The boss didn’t say anymore, but the expression on his face was just
        like he was facing a retard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t bother with him anymore either. He pressed his foot
        against the wall and climbed over the top of the wall, but just as he
        was about to glance down at the state of the pile of bricks down below
        so he could conveniently jump down, he suddenly saw another person
        standing beside the brick pile.
      </p>

      <p>
        “… Principal Liu?” Jiang Cheng was squatting on the wall when he was
        struck dumb.
      </p>

      <p>
        Principal Liu was even more dumbfounded than the shop owner outside. He
        stared at him for a long time but was still at a loss for words.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Principal Liu… good morning.” Jiang Cheng didn’t know whether he should
        jump in or turn around and jump back out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Ah, good morning.” Liu Xiao answered him out of reflex as he continued
        to gape at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng hesitated for a couple of seconds but in the end, he still
        chose to jump in. The pile of bricks was probably used recently as the
        bricks on the edges of the pile had decreased – he just happened to land
        on the empty area in front of Principal Liu when he jumped down.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time he stood up, Principal Liu’s eyeballs were almost popping
        out.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll… head to the classroom now.” Jiang Cheng pointed towards the
        front, and without waiting for Principal Liu to reply, he lifted his
        legs and ran. He sprinted all the way to the school building before he
        finally slowed down.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know whether Principal Liu hadn’t come back to his senses all
        that time or was actually cutting him some slack this time. After all,
        the time he climbed over the wall couldn’t count as
        “late-wall-climbing”, and he didn’t step on any tree branches either… in
        any case, nobody had come looking for him even after three classes in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lao Xu didn’t come to find him either. The previous class was Lao Xu’s,
        yet he just left the classroom the moment he finished teaching and
        didn’t come over to talk to Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt a little bored. He didn’t care much about climbing over
        the wall, but Li Baoguo coming to the school made him feel very ill at
        ease. He didn’t know what it was that Li Baoguo wanted to do or what Li
        Baoguo had said to Lao Xu…
      </p>

      <p><em>So irritating.</em></p>

      <p>
        Adding to that, Gu Fei still hadn’t arrived at school. The seat beside
        him was empty and inside the table were the books and notebooks that Gu
        Fei haphazardly stuffed in, plus some unfinished worksheets.
      </p>

      <p>
        The people in class didn’t pay any mind to Gu Fei skipping class – the
        guy would skip classes every week.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps he was the only one in the entire class who would feel
        uncomfortable about Gu Fei not showing up. The place beside him felt
        desolate, and he felt like there was a void in his heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every time he turned his head and didn’t see Gu Fei, who would have
        lowered his head as he played Craz3 Match, he would unexpectedly feel
        unaccustomed to it.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was only until the final class was nearly halfway over that a figure
        swayed in from the backdoor of the classroom. Jiang Cheng swiftly turned
        to face that direction and caught sight of Gu Fei speeding into the
        classroom.
      </p>

      <p>“I thought you weren’t coming,” Jiang Cheng whispered.</p>

      <p>
        “I said that I would come <em>ah</em>.” Gu Fei smiled. “We still have to
        practice in the afternoon <em>ne</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… I thought you meant that you would come to class,” Jiang Cheng
        mumbled.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I slept late yesterday so I overslept this morning. I came over the
        moment I woke up.” Gu Fei randomly pulled out a few textbooks and tossed
        them on the table. “It’ll be the same whether I listen to this class or
        not. I’ve long been unable to understand it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t say anything in response. He took out a tissue
        adhesive and threw it on his desk.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Such a high-grade item.” Gu Fei picked it up and looked it over a
        couple of times before pocketing it, “Treat me to something for lunch.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng shot him a look: “Based on…”</p>

      <p>“Based on the fact that I always treat you,” Gu Fei cut him off.</p>

      <p>
        “… fine, but I have to pick up a delivery at noon. Conveniently enough,
        you can help me take a look at this place.” Jiang Cheng took out his
        phone and showed Gu Fei the address of the pickup location that he wrote
        down, “Do you know where this is?”
      </p>

      <p>“Yeah.” Gu Fei glanced at him, “It’s beside the railway bridge.”</p>

      <p>
        “Ah.” The moment Jiang Cheng heard the words ‘railway bridge’, he fell
        into a daze.
      </p>

      <p>“You bought something?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “No,” Jiang Cheng answered, “My classmate sent some study materials and
        stuff.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’ll go pick it up with you,” Gu Fei said, “There happens to be a
        really good noodle restaurant in that area.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng started laughing: “How come you know about every delicious
        place there is?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s not that I know every place. It’s just that I’ve already tried out
        every place in the area.” Gu Fei explained, “I grew up here after all.
        My scope of activities is mainly from here to the train station and from
        there to the downtown square. I haven’t really gone anywhere else
        before.”
      </p>

      <p>“Oh.” Jiang Cheng gave him a look.</p>

      <p>
        “Where are you two going?!” Wang Xu disgruntledly called out from the
        parking lot as he fetched his bike, “We can conveniently practice
        afterward if we eat together. I’ve already asked Lao Xu for leave so we
        can have continuous practice! This unorganized and undisciplined
        behavior of yours…”
      </p>

      <p>“We’ll definitely arrive within an hour,” Gu Fei reassured.</p>

      <p>
        “This unorganized and undisciplined behavior is…” Wang Xu continued to
        say.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Captain, what we’re doing right now is asking you for leave.” Jiang
        Cheng interrupted, “Just a one hour leave to take care of some business.
        We promise we’ll report back to you in an hour.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Those words made Wang Xu feel very pleased, so he nodded his head after
        a moment of contemplation: “Alright, you have my approval.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The railway bridge appeared very antiquated – it was probably already
        out of order. The railway in the middle was already covered in rust and
        filled with weeds. The paths on either side were still walkable but only
        pedestrians, bikes, and motorcycles, etc could pass through.
      </p>

      <p>
        After crossing the bridge, Jiang Cheng continuously surveyed the
        surrounding area. Contrary to expectations, the area wasn’t desolate;
        there were many small shops on the roadsides and they actually appeared
        to be pretty hectic. He also never saw a single derelict neighborhood or
        dilapidated building.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It’s over there. We’ve already passed the intersection” Gu Fei turned
        around and pointed at the first intersection they already passed after
        they got off the bridge, “You enter from there.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh.” Jiang Cheng turned back his head to take a glance but didn’t spot
        anything noteworthy. However, the buildings in this area were all pretty
        short – they were basically all four or five-stories each. If a building
        was dilapidated then it meant that it was built much earlier, and its
        floors may be lower. <em>Amen</em>.
      </p>

      <p>
        “If you really want to take a look tomorrow,” Gu Fei slowly pedaled his
        bike. “I’ll get Ding Zhuxin to pick you up <em>ba</em>. She knows…”
      </p>

      <p>“No need.” Jiang Cheng hurriedly interrupted him.</p>

      <p>
        Ding Zhuxin’s slight rejection towards him was something that he could
        detect – he didn’t want to have a Ding Zhuxin next to him when
        spectating something like this.
      </p>

      <p>“Then…” Gu Fei saw that he still had something he wanted to say.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng waved his hand: “Don’t mind me. I already said that I won’t
        let anybody see me go, and I won’t interfere with your brain-ischemic,
        building-jumping activity. Just take care of not getting yourself hurt.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei snickered.</p>

      <p>
        “What’s there to laugh about?” Jiang Cheng snapped, “You’re just one of
        the members of the Team Steel Mill Retards.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei started to laugh even harder.</p>

      <p>
        “Hey! Believe it or not, I’ll…” Jiang Cheng was initially feeling vexed
        when he remembered this matter, but Gu Fei’s laughter had completely
        laughed away his anger. He loosened his hold on the handlebar and
        imitated the sticker that Gu Fei sent him yesterday. With one hand
        curled into a fist, he pointed the other at Gu Fei, “Fuck you up!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei froze before he suddenly dissolved into laughter to the point
        that the head of his bike twisted askew: “Pretty similar.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The materials that Pan Zhi had sent over filled an entire cardboard box
        which was bundled up very sturdily. There was also a USB that was
        contained in a paper bag. Jiang Cheng didn’t open them and just took a
        look at the spines of the books – he suddenly felt a lot more at ease.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is this the person that came with you to Si Zhong last time?” Gu Fei
        skimmed over the delivery note, “Pan Shuai?”<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        “Pan Zhi.” Jiang Cheng took the delivery note and looked over it, “He’s
        a shameless fellow. The guy even used to write his name as Pan An<a
          href="#_ftn4"
          >[4]</a
        >
        on his exam papers before.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei burst out laughing: “But his handwriting really is much more
        handsome than yours.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The handwriting of xuezhas are all good,” Jiang Cheng retorted. “Us
        xuebas can’t be bothered with such insignificant details such as whether
        our handwriting looks good or not.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You really should practice your handwriting.” Gu Fei said, “Lao Xu was
        on the brink of tears when he talked about your marks getting docked off
        from your exam the other day.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “That’s because he never saw my handwriting from before,” Jiang Cheng
        responded. “My old handwriting was unreadable even for me.”
      </p>

      <p>“<em>Ai</em>,” Gu Fei smiled as he sighed, “Let’s go eat noodles.”</p>

      <p>
        Perhaps, it was because he just got a pile of materials, or maybe it was
        because he had played basketball with Gu Fei for an entire afternoon,
        Jiang Cheng felt the melancholy from that morning had dissipated by
        quite a lot. Even when he thought of Li Baoguo, he didn’t feel
        suffocated at all.
      </p>

      <p>
        After they finished practice, they walked out of the school gates. Gu
        Miao was sitting on the roadside with her skateboard placed under her
        butt.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao didn’t need to wear a hat anymore after the weather warms; on
        her head now was a disheveled mop of hair that had never been managed
        since she shaved her head bald and a red headband wrapped around her
        forehead. It really was… full of personality.
      </p>

      <p>“I’ll give you 50 RMB.” Jiang Cheng looked at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>“Okay,” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        This unconventional answer rendered Jiang Cheng in a sudden loss for
        words.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fortunately, Gu Fei returned to a conventional manner after a pause and
        asked: “Why?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Take your dear sister to get a haircut, I beg of you.” Jiang Cheng
        pleaded.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright.” Gu Fei nodded and stretched his hand out in front of him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at his hand, took out his wallet, and took out a 50
        RMB bill and placed it on his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei placed the money in his pocket: “Actually, she doesn’t need any
        money to get a haircut. We can just find Li Yan, his handiwork isn’t too
        shabby.”
      </p>

      <p>“… return my money.” Jiang Cheng was utterly speechless.</p>

      <p>“No.” Gu Fei’s answer was very concise.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng opened his mouth a few times but was unable to utter a
        single word. There was actually such a brazen person in the world!
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Miao followed after the bikes on her skateboard as per usual, but the
        backseat she held onto that day was Jiang Cheng’s. She happily slid all
        the way to the front of Gu Fei’s family’s shop.
      </p>

      <p>“You’re heading back now?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng glanced at the bundle of materials on his backseat,
        “I’m going to head back and take a look at this stuff.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright then,” Gu Fei nodded. “I’ll wait for you at the intersection
        tomorrow morning at eight o’clock.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Okay,” Jiang Cheng responded and gave Gu Miao a wave. “Bye, Er Miao.”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Miao waved back. He smiled and pedaled the bike back.</p>

      <p>
        Si Zhong had arranged for the finals to take place on Saturday. It was
        most likely to make things convenient for all the teachers and students
        at the school as well as the students from the nearby schools to attend
        the game. The game would start at 12 o’clock, but the nervous Captain
        Wang Jiuri ordered everyone to gather at 8:30 to hurry and take that
        time to warm up. Everybody would definitely gather together with
        excitement again after the game was over, and perhaps they might even
        have some fun in the afternoon…
      </p>

      <p>
        Therefore, he probably wouldn’t have any time to familiarize himself
        with the building-jumping location the next day – he could only go that
        night.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he returned to the rented apartment and put everything away, Jiang
        Cheng went out again with his schoolbag and made his way straight to the
        railway bridge.
      </p>

      <p>
        The area around the railway bridge wasn’t desecrated in the least, but
        from the intersection that Gu Fei pointed out before, the amount of
        people had decreased considerably. The storefronts by the roads were
        each shabbier and more nondescript than the last.
      </p>

      <p>
        As he walked along all the way until the end of the road, he was met
        with a small fork. He could see that continuing from the left was a
        bedding and clothing factory, and on the right was a broken road
        littered with cracks.
      </p>

      <p>
        He walked towards the right, and after making his way forward for a few
        minutes, he spotted a couple of buildings with all their windows
        completely broken away.
      </p>

      <p>This was the place.</p>

      <p>
        He slowly rode forward as he surveyed the surrounding area, speculating
        which buildings the Steel Mill Retards were going to play turbo drop on.
      </p>

      <p>
        The couple of buildings right in front of him were definitely not the
        ones; they were too close to the outside so anyone could see them if
        they passed by. They had to be further inside.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng finally stopped in front of a cluster of four side-by-side
        buildings.
      </p>

      <p>
        The garbage around this area was evidently more than the other places;
        there were all sorts of beverage bottles, snack packages, and a ground
        full of cigarette butts. There was also a tin bucket placed in front of
        the building entrance.
      </p>

      <p>
        He went over and glanced inside the bucket – inside was filled with wood
        that had already been burnt into ashes. This should be what the retards
        use when they gather together to keep warm.
      </p>

      <p>
        There wasn’t a single person in the surrounding area. Jiang Cheng leaned
        his bike against a random part of the wall and walked inside the
        dilapidated building across this cluster of buildings.
      </p>

      <p>
        This building was set apart from all the others; it had five floors and
        was the tallest of the buildings in the area. But it was also decrepit
        to the point where he could see grass growing out of the cracks in the
        walls and even inside the building. As he went up, he felt that the
        building would collapse if there were two more people.
      </p>

      <p>
        After he went all the way up to the highest floor, Jiang Cheng walked to
        the window-side and peered towards the other side.
      </p>

      <p>
        The four buildings on the other side could pretty much be confirmed; the
        distance between the buildings wasn’t too wide. The two buildings on the
        right were four-stories tall while the two on the left were
        three-stories. The top of the leftmost building was already half
        caved-in, so it was pretty much only two-stories tall.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hello everyone.” Jiang Cheng raised his left hand and formed his middle
        finger and index finger into a ‘v’ then slowly moved it in front of his
        eyes, “Welcome, and thank you all for watching Episode 1 of Cheng-<em
          >ge</em
        >
        Takes You to Watch theRetards.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He walked to the second window: “The four buildings that everyone can
        see right now is the venue for the Steel Mill Retards Clan’s
        brain-ischemic building-jumping competition… we can deduce that they
        will be jumping from one building to another. According to the degree of
        how retarded they are, they may even proceed for a quadruple jump<a
          href="#_ftn5"
          >[5]</a
        >… A lot of debris can be seen at the venue. These things all have signs
        of deliberate placement so we can also deduce that they may even
        challenge obstacle jumping too…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck,” Jiang Cheng lowered his hand and turned his head to observe the
        area, “Everyone has probably already noticed that the field of vision
        for aiming isn’t very good… let’s see if there’s a more suitable angle.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng toured around the couple of rooms on the fifth floor before
        finally finding half a staircase leading up to the balcony on the
        rooftop.
      </p>

      <p>
        He jumped up and grabbed onto the staircase and after testing and
        determining that it was sturdy enough, he pressed his leg against the
        wall and climbed up from the gap above.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Dear audience, let’s see…” Jiang Cheng walked a few steps along the
        edge of the balcony, “I’m a little… afraid of heights. But for the sake
        of… taking everybody to see the retards… “
      </p>

      <p>
        He slowly edged his way to the edge of the balcony: “This angle is very
        good.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He could clearly see the situation on the rooftop of the opposite
        building from here since the distance couldn’t be considered quite far,
        however… if he positioned himself here and somebody from the other side
        looked over, they could also clearly make out that a person was standing
        here.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a small attic on the top floor so he walked over and stood by
        it – like this, he should be concealed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright, everyone can see,” Jiang Cheng spoke as he fished around in
        his pockets and took out a slingshot and steel ball. He aimed towards
        the opposite balcony and stretched the rubberband taut, “What kind of
        hit we can make at this distance as well as the impact of a hit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After he said that, he took a deep breath and ignored the subtle feeling
        of his legs growing utterly soft.
      </p>

      <p>
        He narrowed his eyes towards the opposite side then loosened his hand
        and the steel ball flew out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Immediately afterward, a wooden rack that was placed on the other
        rooftop toppled over.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Today’s program will be ending here.” Jiang Cheng squinted his eyes
        towards the wooden rack, “After the finals tomorrow, please be on time
        to watch Episode 2 of Cheng-<em>ge </em>Takes You to Watch the Retards.”
      </p>

      <p><em>Translate: Ice | Edit: Sae</em></p>

      <p>The author has something to say: Continuing tomorrow.</p>

      <p>
        “Oho, is Cheng-<em>ge</em> going to cheat ⊙▽⊙?” The author excitedly
        said as she gripped tightly on the fourth and fifth black furry spirits
        that still don’t know how to speak yet.
      </p>

      <p>
        “According to the author’s disposition o(≧口≦)o, even if he does use one
        tomorrow, we won’t see it anyways o(≧口≦)o. We’re basically gonna have
        to read all the way until Friday o(≧口≦)o.” The black furry spirit
        shouted.
      </p>

      <p>The translators have something to say:</p>

      <p>
        Sae: Keep flirting you two! I swear they should have just kissed when Gu
        Fei took Jiang Cheng back!! And Cheng-<em>ge </em>to the rescue bitches!
      </p>

      <p>
        Ice: Ugh, I’m also starting to feel insecure about my studies these
        days… I also need to pick up my pace and start looking at my materials
        or I will lose my own title of a xueba…! QAQ
      </p>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p>
        Although it was Saturday, Jiang Cheng still woke up around the same time
        as usual. When he went downstairs to buy breakfast, he also jogged two
        laps along the nearby street in passing.
      </p>

      <p>
        The number of people around this area in the early morning was far more
        than at Li Baoguo’s. Besides the middle-aged uncles and aunties, there
        also wasn’t a lack of youngsters.
      </p>

      <p>
        What to eat for breakfast was a very headache-inducing question for him,
        so with his hands stuffed in his pockets, Jiang Cheng paced back and
        forth in front of a couple of breakfast stalls, hesitating because of
        not knowing just what exactly he wanted to eat.
      </p>

      <p>“Mini steamed buns <em>ba</em>,” someone said from behind him.</p>

      <p>
        That voice was very close to him – practically coming from right next to
        his ear. Jiang Cheng jumped in fright, reaching into his pocket for his
        phone and whipping his head around at the same time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Only when he was face-to-face with the person behind him did he realize
        that the voice belonged to Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        Of course, not only was the voice Gu Fei’s, but the face was also Gu
        Fei’s.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck?” Jiang Cheng was so shocked that he stumbled back a step. He
        looked him up and down, then fished out his phone to look at the time.
        “The sun isn’t rising from the west today…”
      </p>

      <p>
        He tilted his head back to look at the sky: “It must’ve not set
        yesterday…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Er Miao got up early today, and I got woken up when she started playing
        around with her skateboard in the house.” Gu Fei laughed, “So I just
        came over.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Have you eaten yet?” Jiang Cheng also started chuckling. He didn’t know
        why, but when he saw Gu Fei smile, he also felt the urge to smile.
        “Let’s eat together?”
      </p>

      <p>“Are you treating me?” Gu Fei asked.</p>

      <p>
        “Didn’t you just trick 50 RMB out of me yesterday?” Jiang Cheng glared
        at him.
      </p>

      <p>“Fine then,” Gu Fei shrugged. “How about mini steamed buns?”</p>

      <p>
        “Mini steamed buns, dumplings, tofu pudding, and fried dough sticks.”
        Jiang Cheng consecutively listed out all the things he had a hard time
        choosing to eat between. “One serving of each, oh and that braised beef
        smells pretty good too.”
      </p>

      <p>“Go get a table.” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        Even though this area was also an old suburb, the residential buildings
        were pretty concentrated, so the amount of people at the breakfast
        stalls were quite a lot. Jiang Cheng stood to the side and surveyed for
        a while before he hurriedly took up two empty stools in front of a
        table; he sat on one and used his backpack to take up another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just when he wanted to signal Gu Fei to where he was, he spotted two
        girls sitting across the table the moment he lifted his gaze. They kept
        glancing at him as they giggled, and the moment he looked over, the two
        of them would swiftly lower their heads back down again.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Here.” Jiang Cheng caught sight of Gu Fei who was holding two
        steamer-full of steamed buns, so he then raised his hand and snapped his
        fingers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei walked over and put the things on the table: “I got everything
        you said you wanted <em>ah</em>. Is there anything else you want to
        eat?”
      </p>

      <p>“Nope,” Jiang Cheng replied.</p>

      <p>
        The two girls across the table still had their heads lowered, giggling
        as they played a game of ‘if you give me a pinch on my arm, then I’ll
        give you a pinch on your thigh’.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng recalled what Gu Fei had said before and felt that he might
        have understood what was going on with those two.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei placed a giant heap of plates and steamers on the table, nearly
        taking up the entire thing.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Wang Xu gave me a call.” Gu Fei picked up a mini steamed bun and ate as
        he talked, “He’s already there, and it’s just him.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Was it to denounce us for being unorganized and undisciplined?” Jiang
        Cheng grabbed a bowl of tofu pudding and took a gulp.
      </p>

      <p>“Very dignified,” Gu Fei nodded.</p>

      <p>
        The two girls had already finished eating, yet they didn’t seem to have
        the intention to leave. They had taken out their phones and lowered
        their heads to play on them – again, but judging by their postures,
        Jiang Cheng suspected that they were using their cameras to peek over at
        their side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just when he wanted to turn his head away to save himself from being
        possibly captured in various ugly and deforming angles, Gu Fei raised
        his head and shot a look at the two girls: “Stop trying to secretly take
        pictures of us, it’s easy for the faces to become deformed.”
      </p>

      <p>“Ah!” The two girls briefly shrieked at the tops of their throat.</p>

      <p>
        “Then can we directly take pictures of you?” One of the girls asked.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t respond, and the girl raised her camera towards the two of
        them. Jiang Cheng could only look into the camera lens along with Gu
        Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        After the girl finished taking the pictures, she grabbed her schoolbag
        and stuffed her phone in the bag before she said with a smile: “We’re
        going to post this in Si Zhong’s school forum, so remember to take a
        look <em>ah</em>. We’ll be posting more at a later date too…”
      </p>

      <p>
        After the two girls left, Jiang Cheng glanced at Gu Fei: “What class are
        they from?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “No idea,” Gu Fei responded. “They might not even be a part of our
        school.”
      </p>

      <p>“Ah?” Jiang Cheng was stupefied.</p>

      <p>
        “A lot of other schools will be coming to see today’s match
        <em>ah</em>,” Gu Fei said. “And somebody had spread a video of our game
        with Class 7 online. That time you blocked the ball, a ton of people
        learned about it and want to come and watch.”
      </p>

      <p>“… Fuck.” Jiang Cheng felt a little at a loss.</p>

      <p>
        “I asked Li Yan to come over today to take some pictures.” Gu Fei
        continued, “I promised Jiuri that I’ll help find somebody to take
        pictures for him, remember.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “His performance level would probably shoot up the moment he sees the
        camera.” Jiang Cheng burst into laughter.
      </p>

      <p>
        “His performance level will have to shoot up.” Gu Fei turned his head to
        look at him, “Let’s just say, I’ve only played this one game since I
        came to Si Zhong. There are many people waiting to watch
        <em>ne</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng earnestly nodded his head. He thought for a while
        before lamenting, “If you didn’t join, would I have had to partner up
        with Wang Xu?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t answer, just doubling up in laughter with a dumpling still
        held in his chopsticks.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game was to begin at 12:00, yet the students from both their school
        and other schools had already filled the courts at 9:00. Jiang Cheng and
        the rest could only practice and warm-up for half an hour before they
        couldn’t continue any longer – there were people everywhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at the people crowded at the sidelines, Jiang Cheng felt that
        the students around this area were really idle. If he were to talk about
        his old school, basically nobody would have the time to go watch another
        school’s basketball game on the weekend.
      </p>

      <p>
        This final game of Si Zhong’s was put together pretty formally – they
        even brought over a bunch of bleachers from who-knows-where. They were
        placed all around the court, and when Jiang Cheng and the rest came in
        and seated themselves in the resting area, the bleachers were already
        filled to the brim with people. Surprisingly, there were even quite a
        lot of people standing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Yan arrived at 9:30 with Gu Fei’s camera bag on his shoulders. He sat
        down in the resting area: “Such an extravagant scene… those who don’t
        know would think this was the city’s league match <em>ne</em>…”
      </p>

      <p>“Make sure to do a good job for Wang Xu’s picture,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Now that depends on how he plays,” Li Yan retorted as he equipped the
        lens on the camera. “I’m not you who can make even a cow’s head look
        ethereal when taking a picture. However he is, that’ll be how I’ll
        capture him.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “And also the other team members,” Gu Fei continued. “Take some pictures
        of them too. It’s not easy for our class to play till the finals.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Got it.” Li Yan raised the camera and peered at their surroundings
        through it, “It’s not easy for you to care so much about something
        either.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Before the match even started, Principal Liu was basically at the brink
        of ecstasy – he even made a brief speech to introduce the teams in the
        boys’ finals match to the audience.
      </p>

      <p>
        One was a winning team that had never once been defeated, and the other
        team was a dark horse that suddenly came out of nowhere.<a href="#_ftn1"
          >[1]</a
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng heard Principal Liu’s introduction, he started feeling
        nervous for some reason, especially since the cheerleading teams on
        either side were also constantly screaming amidst the speech.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yi Jing, who normally appeared very scholarly and even gave people a
        slightly introverted impression, was incredibly bold as she led the
        cheerleading squad, actually being able to shout out such embarrassing
        slogans in a very confident<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Class 8, Class 8! Dark Horse, stands abreast!”<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        “Class 8, Class 8! Handsomeness<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>, are the best!”
      </p>

      <p>
        The slogan that was shouted made Jiang Cheng not even want to raise his
        head anymore. With his arms propped on his knees, he started to stare
        fixedly at his own shoes.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>.” Gu Fei called out to him and stretched his hand out
        below him in a very covert manner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng was in the middle of pondering how they were to play later,
        so when he saw his hand, he couldn’t respond for a while and just
        extended his hand out to scratch a few times at the hollow of his palm
        with his finger.
      </p>

      <p>“… I’m asking for a high-five,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Ah.” Jiang Cheng finally came back to his senses and gave his palm a
        light slap.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Watch out for He Zhou,” Gu Fei warned. “He’s a rearguard, and just like
        you, he’s pretty versatile and is quick on his feet.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En, don’t always run in a straight line today.” Jiang Cheng nodded. He
        didn’t arrange any specific tactics that day; going against a team whose
        cooperation had already been honed to the peak like Class 2, any tactics
        they might have would ultimately be completely disrupted with Class 8’s
        level of skill. So on that day, everyone could only rely on the tacit
        understanding that had been formed over this recent period of time; they
        would just have to analyze the situation more after playing.
      </p>

      <p>“Yes, sir.” Gu Fei replied.</p>

      <p>
        The two captains began choosing the courts; Wang Xu won, and he could
        still be called fairly bright when he chose the side that had their
        backs to the light when going on offense.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Gu Fei will go jump the ball,” Jiang Cheng said before they went on the
        court.
      </p>

      <p>“<em>Jiayou!</em>”<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a> Wang Xu yelled.</p>

      <p>
        “<em>Jiayou!</em>” The rest of the group yelled along with him, took off
        their jackets, and walked into the courts.
      </p>

      <p>
        This sort of feeling was very exhilarating. Although Jiang Cheng didn’t
        like being watched by a crowd, he wasn’t against putting himself in the
        limelight. Now that he stood himself in the middle of the court, and
        even detected the faint clicks of a shutter mixed along with the
        surrounding shouts of “<em>jiayou</em>”, he suddenly felt an extremely
        powerful thrill.
      </p>

      <p>
        The player who was jumping the ball from Class 2 was around the same
        height as Gu Fei, but he had found out from the previous game that this
        person was extremely good at jumping – for that sole reason, nobody in
        Class 8 could compare to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Sure enough, after the referee threw the ball, the height of this
        grasshopper’s jump overtook that of Gu Fei’s by almost an entire palm…
        the ball was passed to He Zhou.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to Jiang Cheng’s judgment, this pass could be intercepted by
        him, but just when he stepped forward and reached out his hands, He Zhou
        shot forward and slapped the ball to the side the moment he made contact
        with it.
      </p>

      <p>
        And Grasshopper who had left the centerline at who-knows-when had caught
        the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Fuck!</em> Jiang Cheng cursed deep in his mind. He exchanged a
        glance with Gu Fei, and Gu Fei raised his legs and bolted towards the
        basket with Grasshopper.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t directly follow up but stuck to He Zhou’s side
        instead; one was to prevent him from catching the ball again, and two
        was to see for himself just how fast this person could be!
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 2’s swift offense was played extremely gorgeously. After just two
        passes, Grasshopper had taken the ball and swung past Gu Fei and took a
        jump shot!
      </p>

      <p>
        Amidst a mass of shouts, Gu Fei suddenly also jumped up from behind him.
        Jiang Cheng’s heart thumped. It was far too easy to make a mistake with
        this sort of posture – if he slipped off even the slightest, he would
        hit his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        But because he had been blocked by Gu Fei, Grasshopper’s jump this time
        was only at an average height.
      </p>

      <p>Amen!</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng temporarily abandoned He Zhou and darted to Gu Fei’s left.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei jumped incredibly high, and after leaping up from behind
        Grasshopper, he smoothly<a href="#_ftn6">[6]</a> swept away the ball
        that had just left his hands. During a wave of excited screams, Jiang
        Cheng jumped up and caught the ball. He then yelled: “Wang Xu!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu was at the midline, and with this yell of his, Wang Xu swiftly
        turned around and sprinted back.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had dribbled the ball forward by only a few steps when he
        spotted He Zhou out of the corner of his eye. Thus, he abruptly raised
        his hands and instead swung the ball in Wang Xu’s direction.
      </p>

      <p>Work hard, Captain!</p>

      <p>Amen, Amen, Amennn!</p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu leaped up in the middle of his run, stretched out his hands, and
        caught a both high and long pass.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 8’s cheerleading team instantly started jumping, and the always
        rhythmic “<em>Jiayou!!!!</em>” instantly turned into a series of
        “AAHHHH——”
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 2’s return to defense was extremely swift, but Wang Xu had taken
        advantage of that time. When he reached the basket, it was a one-to-one
        showdown. If he were to shoot now, the chances of the ball going in
        would be incredibly high.
      </p>

      <p>
        But Wang Xu hesitated at the moment of shooting and turned around to
        pass the ball to Gu Fei who had just ran past the three-point line.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was obvious that Gu Fei had come over to grab a rebound, so when Wang
        Xu suddenly passed the ball over to him, he didn’t expect it at all – he
        didn’t even have the chance to adjust his posture of rushing forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        He had caught the ball with a backhanded hook, but he didn’t get to have
        a firm grasp on the ball when he was blocked by a person from Class 2
        with a wristband on his arm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following that was a pass, swift offense, and by the time He Zhou made a
        three-pointer, the people from Class 8 didn’t even get the chance to go
        near him.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first shot incited a roar of applause and shouts from the sidelines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Guo Xu took the ball and prepared to toss it while Jiang Cheng walked
        over to Wang Xu’s side: “This match can’t only depend on Gu Fei and I.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu nodded his head, not speaking a word. It was clear to see that
        this mistake made him feel like somebody had stabbed a knife<a
          href="#_ftn7"
          >[7]</a
        >
        into his heart and twisted it, twisting it to the point where the
        expression on his face contorted clockwise. Jiang Cheng patted him on
        the back: “That shot just now was one you could’ve made.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En!” Wang Xu shook his head and immediately reverted to his usual
        state. “I also fucking think so.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Guo Xu tossed the ball, and Jiang Cheng caught it, but he turned around
        without rushing to dribble it forward. Instead, he used his left hand to
        point to the side and Wang Xu immediately rushed to the midline,
        preparing to catch the ball. With a wave of his hand, he passed the ball
        to Gu Fei on the other side, before dashing towards the opponent’s
        basket.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment, Wang Xu’s IQ also soared as he played; he didn’t become
        dumbstruck when Jiang Cheng used him as a red herring when he made that
        pass, but rather promptly pressed towards the basket.
      </p>

      <p>
        Behind Gu Fei was Grasshopper. He didn’t dribble the ball, and instead,
        turned his body while using his arm to guard the ball as he remained
        rooted in place. When Lu Xiaobin came over to receive the ball, he
        passed the ball to Jiang Cheng who was already almost at the
        three-pointer line.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng caught the ball when Wristband came over to block him. He
        internally sighed. Class 2 being the longtime winners wasn’t something
        to be taken for granted. This defending speed… even like this, he wasn’t
        able to shake him off.
      </p>

      <p>
        His intention of pressing towards the three-pointer line and making a
        shot had no chance of happening now. He glanced at the line before
        clenching his teeth and abruptly making a shot towards the backboard at
        a spot that was no more than a meter away from the three-pointer line.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t have anybody blocking him at that moment, which gave him
        the time to catch the rebound ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        But just when Gu Fei rushed over, the ball slammed against the backboard
        with a deafening noise and beautifully bounced into the net.
      </p>

      <p>“What the fuck?” Jiang Cheng himself was a little dumbstruck.</p>

      <p>
        The people on the surrounding bleachers burst into a roar, completely
        submerging Wang Xu’s shout of ‘Jiang Cheng, you’re too fucking awesome’.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei sprinted towards him with the corners of his lips lifting into a
        smile. He raised his palms at him as he ran over to his side, saying:
        “Really awesome <em>ah</em>, three-point king.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s do it again.” Jiang Cheng moved towards him and gave him a
        high-five before giving him a bump on the shoulder along the way, “From
        the right to the baseline.”
      </p>

      <p>“En,” Gu Fei sounded in agreement.</p>

      <p>
        Making a three-point shot from the baseline was a little tricky, but the
        defense there may not be as tight<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> as opposed to
        the midline.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 2 wasn’t the same as the teams they had previously played against;
        the skill levels of the players were very equal, and each one of them
        was someone that could carry a team when alone. Wanting to steal the
        ball from their hands was a very difficult feat.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had attempted to steal the ball from He Zhou twice, but He
        Zhou retaliated with a three-pointer under Grasshopper’s cover.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Don’t be anxious!” Lao Lu’s voice traveled over from the breaks between
        the screams. Probably because this was the final match, he didn’t boldly
        use a speaker anymore. “Play stably! Class 8, Class 8! Your handsomeness
        are the best——”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t even want to turn his head in that direction. Out of
        just two slogans, Lao Lu actually managed to pick out the most shameful
        one to shout out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 2’s shot made both the people on and off the court a little
        excited. Guo Xu’s strength when he passed the ball to Jiang Cheng was
        astonishing – it was like a cannonball.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he turned around, He Zhou was already blocking the route he would
        make the pass.
      </p>

      <p><em>What fast reflexes.</em></p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng dribbled the ball twice where he stood. He then dashed over
        to He Zhou until he was right in front of him, and just when He Zhou was
        about to steal the ball, he leaned over as if he was about to embrace
        him before hooking his arm to the side, pressing the ball to his calf
        when he made a pass from behind He Zhou to Gu Fei who was already
        running towards the opponents’ basket.
      </p>

      <p>
        This pass was too low, and Gu Fei almost staggered when he caught the
        ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng followed him but kept a close eye on He Zhou. Gu Fei didn’t
        have a chance to pass the ball back, so he decisively gave the ball to
        Wang Xu who was running around like crazy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu’s IQ at this moment was off the charts; just when he caught the
        ball, he immediately passed the ball back to Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        With this pass, He Zhou had a moment of hesitation, and Jiang Cheng
        hurriedly broke away from him and rushed to the baseline from the right
        sideline.
      </p>

      <p>
        While he hadn’t stabilized his footing yet, Gu Fei threw the ball over.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s position was basically a straight line from the backboard!
        The players from Class 2 hastily rushed back to the three-second zone!
      </p>

      <p>This was exactly the effect he wanted!</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng fixed his gaze on the basket, and without a shred of
        hesitation, he raised his arms and threw the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        The audience’s shouts practically sounded from right behind him, the
        decibels rising along with the trajectory of the ball until it finally
        reached its peak when the ball fell into the basket.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Good shot!” Jiang Cheng gave a low shout. His arms which were raised
        into the air slammed down as he cheered for himself, “Fuck!”
      </p>

      <p>
        With this back and forth, two three-pointers were made, making
        everyone’s fighting spirit ignite.
      </p>

      <p>
        The current situation on court wasn’t tilting towards one side; Class
        2’s skill level and cooperation were much stronger than that of Class 8,
        but because they have never lost a game before, they would never allow
        the championship to fall into another’s hands – the players’ pressure
        was immense. In contrast, Class 8’s players were playing in a
        considerably more let-loose manner. Whether they win or lose, they were
        already the dark horse. Thus, they didn’t have any pressure and could
        just throw open their arms and play.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even a taciturn person like Lu Xiaobin was shouting as he was playing as
        if he was a spirit high on drugs.<a href="#_ftn9">[9]</a> Jiang Cheng
        constantly felt like if he wasn’t careful, he may end up swallowing the
        person next to him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Neither classes called for a break, nor did they switch anyone in. Both
        sides wanted to maintain the rhythm and score some points while the
        momentum was still good.
      </p>

      <p>
        The difference in scores was finally starting to grow bigger, with Class
        8’s score steadily falling behind, yet holding on tight as the
        difference never exceeded more than one or two points.
      </p>

      <p>
        With only three minutes remaining in the first half of the game, Gu Fei
        made a shot while blocked by two people, and managed to turn the tables
        by one point.
      </p>

      <p>
        Amidst the frenzied screams of the audience, Class 2 called for a break.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Jiang Cheng walked towards the resting area, He Zhou blocked him:
        “You should join the school team.”
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Jiang Cheng froze.</p>

      <p>“You should join the school team,” He Zhou repeated once more.</p>

      <p>
        A long while passed before Jiang Cheng snapped back to his senses: “No,
        wait, you’re telling me that at a time like this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I wanted to tell you this after we finish playing,” He Zhou said. “But
        I’m a little excited.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… let’s talk about this after the match <em>ba</em>,” Jiang Cheng
        responded.
      </p>

      <p>
        “How about playing another game after the match?” He Zhou asked, “You,
        me, Gu Fei, Tang Xiwei, and Song Yu a team.”
      </p>

      <p>“Song Yu?” Jiang Cheng couldn’t recall who Song Yu was.</p>

      <p>
        “Our class’s center.” He Zhou pointed towards the other side at
        Grasshopper, “How about it?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at Grasshopper in astonishment. He didn’t know what
        kind of expectations his parents had to give him such a name, and felt
        tempted to give Pan Zhi a call to have ‘Pan An’ come over and become
        sworn brothers with Song Yu<a href="#_ftn10">[10]</a>…
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s talk about it after we finish the game,” Jiang Cheng reiterated.
        “One where we finish seriously.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I’m already very serious… alright then.” He Zhou gave him a pat on the
        shoulder, “Let’s finish playing first.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng had to clench his teeth and grip his arm in order to not
        reflexively slap He Zhou’s hand away.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What did he say to you?” Gu Fei was squatting at the sidelines and
        stood up when he saw him run over.
      </p>

      <p>
        “He wants me to join the school team and also said to play another game
        together afterward.” Jiang Cheng explained.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That excited huh?” Gu Fei laughed, “But then again, he’s always been
        like this.”
      </p>

      <p>“Is he from the school team?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>
        “En, he’s the captain of the school team.” Gu Fei revealed, “Just like
        you before.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng glanced at him but didn’t say a word.</p>

      <p>
        “Stop running together all the time!” Li Yan was holding up the camera,
        “Keep some distance! When running, don’t always look at yourself and the
        opponent, look at where your teammates are too! You must let yourselves
        always be open to catch the ball!”
      </p>

      <p>“En!” Everyone nodded their heads.</p>

      <p>
        “If somebody is blocked, it’s enough for one person to go over to
        receive the ball. Don’t all go crowding over there.” Li Yan pointed at
        Guo Xu, “You’re just like that. If somebody goes to receive the ball
        then you should run somewhere and prepare for the next pass.”
      </p>

      <p>“Okay!” Guo Xu nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “And you two…” Li Yan stared at Gu Fei and Jiang Cheng, contemplated for
        a long while, but didn’t know what he could say, “You two just keep
        acting handsome.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yan-<em>ge</em>,” Wang Xu looked fixedly at the camera in Li Yan’s
        hands. “You’ve taken quite a lot of pictures today, right?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Yan swept a glance at him: “Don’t worry, it’s enough for you to make
        an album. There’s enough for you to look at three a day for an entire
        month without similarities.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Even though I’m the captain, you can’t just take pictures of me
        <em>ah</em>.” Wang Xu said, “Take some of Gu Fei <em>ah</em>, Jiang
        Cheng <em>ah</em>, and our other players <em>ah</em>…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Have all your IQ been thrown into a basketball net?” Li Yan
        irritatingly cut him off.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng laughed as he turned away, just in time to see Yi Jing
        standing behind Gu Fei, holding a bottle of water. Just when he wanted
        to call out to Gu Fei to take it, Yi Jing smiled as she passed the water
        to him: “You take it.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Thank you.” Jiang Cheng received the water, drinking it as he glanced
        towards Gu Fei’s collarbones.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t know if Gu Fei’s injury, after playing a game like this… he
        caught sight of a small corner of gauze exposed under his shirt collar –
        on it was blood.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shit.” He frowned, leaned over to pull open Gu Fei’s collar, and looked
        inside. The amount of blood seeping out wasn’t much, but there was
        already a small patch, “You…”
      </p>

      <p>
        But he didn’t get to finish speaking when a series of screams sounded
        over from a group of girls to the side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng snapped back to his senses, hurriedly loosened his hand, and
        took a step back.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What happened? What happened?” Wang Xu immediately noticed the ruckus
        on this side and rushed over to Gu Fei before pulling open his collar,
        “Holy fu…”
      </p>

      <p>
        The girls’ screams instantly escalated, then turned into a fit of
        giggles.
      </p>

      <p>“You’re going up now.” Li Yan pulled Wang Xu away.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng put down the bottle of water. As he walked towards the
        court, he felt a bunch of stares boring into his back, so heated that
        his entire body was drowned in discomfort.
      </p>

      <p>
        He truly did have the uncontrollable desire and urge to draw closer,
        become more intimate, and xx towards Gu Fei, but this sort of situation
        where any casual movement would result in him being surrounded by
        screams was still… it made him a little panicked.
      </p>

      <p>
        He felt uncomfortable for quite a long time, and he could only thank the
        heavens they put Wang Xu by his side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thank Wang Xu who had a string missing from his head for saving him from
        this maddening awkwardness…
      </p>

      <p>“It’s fine,” Gu Fei said from beside him.</p>

      <p>“Was it torn?” Jiang Cheng asked.</p>

      <p>“Probably,” Gu Fei responded. “I didn’t even feel anything.”</p>

      <p>
        “… would it have any effect on the brain-ischemic building-jumping?”
        Jiang Cheng sighed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It would probably have a little effect <em>ba</em>,” Gu Fei replied.
        “But this matter, if I finish jumping without getting a little hurt, Hou
        Zi wouldn’t back down either.”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng stared at him without saying a word.</p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>,” Gu Fei started jogging towards the midline when he
        turned back to look at him, and suddenly pointed at the place under
        Class 2’s basket in a very serious manner, “Fuck them up!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Jiang Cheng couldn’t hold back his laughter, thus he also
        pointed a finger over there. “Fuck it up!”
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p data-adtags-visited="true"></p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The time in which Class 2 called for the break was very suitable; the
        amount of time left before the end of the first half of the game was
        only three minutes. Not only did this interrupt Class 8’s stable
        rhythm<a href="#_ftn1">[1]</a>, but it also didn’t allow Class 8 to
        adjust back before the first half of the match ended. With the resting
        time, Class 8 may not be able to restore that spectacular rhythm.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng glanced at the scoreboard – they were four points behind.
        That wasn’t too big of a difference, and if he must say, it was actually
        very easy to catch up to. But their opponent was Class 2, and no matter
        whether it was their overall skill level or their individual skill
        levels, they were all an entire league higher than Class 2. Thus, these
        four points seem to have become a bit unreachable.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        They had to give thanks to Li Yan for the match that day; besides taking
        pictures, Li Yan had also become their off-court coach along the way.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        During the break, a mass of people squatted together to listen to Li
        Yan’s arrangement.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “I’m very straightforward when I talk, so don’t take it to heart. I
        think you are all too anxious.” Li Yan started summarizing after saying
        this, “If you guys want to win, you must go all out, so nobody is
        allowed to remain standing in one place, all of you must be running. The
        players from their class are from the school team, right? That level of
        cooperation can’t be formed after only one or two months. Again, if you
        guys want to win… or if you just don’t want the difference in scores to
        grow any bigger, you must put in the effort.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Got it!” The gang stretched out their arms together and shouted in
        conjunction.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Jiang Cheng, you might not get many chances for a three-pointer in the
        second half. They will keep a close eye on you.” Li Yan looked at Jiang
        Cheng, “You have to find a chance for Gu Fei.”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">“En,” Jiang Cheng nodded.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “<em>Jiayou</em>.” Li Yan raised the camera and pointed it towards his
        face, taking a picture.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">Jiang Cheng looked at him and sighed.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        “Pretty good.” Li Yan passed the camera over to him, “Taking pictures of
        your captain is a real challenge. That pose…”
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Jiang Cheng doubled over in laughter, glancing to the side at Wang Xu
        who was drinking water with his arms akimbo.
      </p>

      <p>
        The second half of the match began, and the players from both classes
        were going at each other’s throats. Not only were the players on court
        extra aggressive, but the cheerleaders off the court were also shouting
        like crazy. If it weren’t for the line on the ground and the linesman
        standing there, those girls might have rushed onto the court to shout at
        the opposing side.
      </p>

      <p>
        This game only lasted for half an hour, yet Jiang Cheng felt a little
        tired. This was something unlike all their previous games, so it
        consumed a lot of physical strength; because even if Wang Xu and the
        rest were going all out against them, the gap in skill still depended on
        him and Gu Fei to fill.
      </p>

      <p>
        After covering Gu Fei for seven consecutive layups, Jiang Cheng could
        even feel the sweat from his forehead falling into his eyes. However,
        since he didn’t have a habit of wearing a wristband, he could only use
        his sleeves to wipe it away.
      </p>

      <p>“Want one?” Gu Fei asked from beside him.</p>

      <p>“En?” Jiang Cheng stared at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Here.” Gu Fei was a weirdo who wore two wristbands, and had handed his
        left one to him, “I haven’t used this side to wipe my sweat yet.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wanted to say, ‘do you think that your sweat wouldn’t soak
        into your wristband’, but Gu Fei immediately followed up with: “Hurry
        while your sweat hasn’t flowed from your arms to your wrists.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… fuck.” Jiang Cheng dissolved into laughter. He took the wristband in
        his hand and used it to wipe the sweat on his forehead in passing.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Have you seen that Number 9?” Gu Fei asked, “He doesn’t have any
        strength left, so he’s been constantly running along the left line. I’m
        going to try going over from the left side in a bit.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t reply. His and Gu Fei’s cooperation entailed the
        midline and right borderline because going down along the left was not
        something those who dribble with their right hand are accustomed to.
      </p>

      <p>“Let me see if I can show off a bit,” Gu Fei said again.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t have the time to contemplate on how he was going to
        show off since Guo Xu had already roared as he prepared to throw the
        ball, so he could only hurriedly start to run.
      </p>

      <p>
        Lu Xiaobin caught the ball and dribbled it forward by two steps before
        passing it to him. Gu Fei was already past the midline, but just when he
        caught the ball and was about to make a pass, Gu Fei abruptly leaned to
        the left from the midline.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng promptly passed the ball over to him. The timing was
        perfectly enacted, as it managed to just bounce into Gu Fei’s hand when
        he took two steps onto the left sideline.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng immediately pressed ahead from the midline to the basket in
        preparation to receive the ball.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei switched to dribbling with his left hand, and the girls in the
        audience screamed wildly, as if Gu Fei was running naked across the
        court. That… rendered Jiang Cheng a little speechless. Using one’s left
        hand to dribble wasn’t something particularly remarkable since anybody
        who regularly played ball would have practiced it, otherwise, it would
        take too much effort to go around the opponent. Even if Gu Fei’s
        dribbling with his left hand was very stable, his character and good
        looks definitely played a big part – a very big part. Grasshopper had
        also used his left hand to dribble past three people at once, yet he
        clearly didn’t see or hear anybody screaming for him like that…
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei very quickly made his way to the left baseline. It wasn’t easy to
        do a layup from this angle since it was similar to the position Jiang
        Cheng was in when he made the three-pointer. Therefore, Class 2’s main
        goal was to prevent him from making any passes. Number 9 was the only
        one following closely behind him, an opponent that could suppress him so
        that he wouldn’t have any chance to turn toward the basket and make a
        shot.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng ran along the three-second zone while staring fixedly at Gu
        Fei’s every movement, ready to assist at any given moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        But at this time, Gu Fei suddenly sidestepped. With his left hand on the
        ball, he aggressively swung his arm above his head and sent the ball
        flying towards the basket!
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >Fuck! He actually wants to score a three-pointer with this posture,
          from this angle?! </em
        >Jiang Cheng hurriedly shouted “Xiaobin!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Lu Xiaobin immediately cut to the basket and squeezed back and forth
        against the others, waiting to grab the rebound.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, the ball that Gu Fei had so nonchalantly sent out with a swing
        of his arm had – with a beautiful arc – actually landed into the basket!
      </p>

      <p>“Fuck!” Jiang Cheng jumped up and yelled, “Fuck!”</p>

      <p>
        The earth-shattering screams outside the court were deafening. Lao Lu
        waved his arms: “Gu Fei! Well done! Well done! Class 8, Class 8!
        Handsomeness, are the best!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng couldn’t even be bothered to complain about what this match
        even had to do with their ‘handsomeness’ to make Lao Lu so persistent in
        saying something like this. He made his way over to Gu Fei and bumped
        his shoulder with a jump: “Are you sick?!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Was I handsome?” Gu Fei also jumped up and gave his shoulder a bump.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Super fucking handsome.” Jiang Cheng replied, “Our morale has shot up.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The three-pointer Gu Fei made had not only lifted Class 8’s morales but
        also boosted Class 2’s.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 2 immediately deployed a swift counterattack and scored back two
        points.
      </p>

      <p>
        The atmospheres both on and off the court suddenly heated to a boiling
        point – definitely more than enough to steam a few baskets of buns.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just as Li Yan had said, wanting to maintain the difference in the score
        wasn’t an easy feat under these circumstances. It was like a game of
        yoyo, every time they scored a shot, Class 2 would come back with
        another one.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the last quarter, Class 8 was still behind by three points.
        Theoretically speaking, this difference was a matter that could be
        easily solved with one shot if they played at their best, but in
        reality, catching up was extremely difficult with Class 2’s fighting
        spirits had all been aroused to such a level.
      </p>

      <p>
        During a timeout, Jiang Cheng had his arms propped on his knees. He
        could hear the players surrounding him panting like a hurdle of cows.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Guo Xu, go down and rest for a while.” Li Yan didn’t discuss tactics
        with them at the moment, “And switch in someone taller. If they attack
        then all of you return to guard the basket, and if they aim for a
        three-pointer then just let Gu Fei and Jiang Cheng handle it.”
      </p>

      <p>“Got it.” Wang Xu nodded.</p>

      <p>
        “Since you guys don’t seem to have a problem with scoring, the key is to
        not let them score again. Otherwise, if you score and they score, it’ll
        be over.” Li Yan said.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a game where both sides fought tooth and nail but the disparity in
        skill was clearly present, it was practically impossible for Class 8 to
        prevent Class 2 from scoring. As he was saying that, Li Yan had shot Gu
        Fei and Jiang Cheng a look. Jiang Cheng was very clear that he was only
        saying this for the other players to not be discouraged.
      </p>

      <p>
        After they made the switch and went back onto the court, they gained a
        little more height under the basket. But, with Grasshopper’s jump, the
        effect wasn’t that noticeable.
      </p>

      <p>
        With only four minutes left in the game, the difference in scores had
        increased to five points. Li Yan called for them to switch again, having
        Guo Xu go back in.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s just go all out,” Guo Xu brought along those words. “Spare no
        effort on scoring.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng felt that even when he previously played in school
        tournaments, he had never before been under such immense pressure. There
        were the audience’s cries of “<em>jiayou</em>”, their screams, the
        cheerleading team’s persisting cadence, his teammates fighting for it as
        if their life depended on it, and also the opponents doing their all.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s get a three-pointer,” Gu Fei said when he ran over to his side.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a few rounds of going back and forth, the difference in score
        dropped to four points. When the ball landed in Jiang Cheng’s hand, he
        glanced at the timer and saw that there was less than a minute
        remaining. If it was between two teams with similar skills, there would
        be a bit of hope, but now… he still dribbled the ball as he dashed to
        the other side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Midway there, he ran into He Zhou, so he passed the ball to Gu Fei who
        immediately passed it to Wang Xu.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu and Lu Xiaobin cooperated to reach the three-second zone, but
        their shot was blocked. Fortunately, the opponent contending for the
        rebound with Lu Xiaobin was rendered utterly dumbfounded by his
        thunderous scream. Lu Xiaobin benefited from that moment of shock and
        successfully stole the rebound.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng could feel the formidable power of his roar from where he
        stood at the three-point line. If it were a wuxia novel, that opponent
        would probably be bleeding from all the orifices of his body right now,
        and even his heart and arteries and veins torn from the inside out.
      </p>

      <p>Lu Xiaobin passed the ball to Jiang Cheng.</p>

      <p><em>Get a three-pointer.</em></p>

      <p>
        With Gu Fei’s words still resounding in his mind, he jumped up without
        the slightest hesitation after he caught the ball. He Zhou was right in
        front of him and had jumped up at the same time that he did.
      </p>

      <p>
        He leaned back a bit, and at this moment, at least a hundred chants of
        “give me your blessing, my idol Fujima”<a href="#_ftn2">[2]</a> flooded
        through his mind…
      </p>

      <p>The ball left his hands.</p>

      <p>
        He Zhou didn’t get to touch the ball that flew out with a large arc.
      </p>

      <p>
        When their foot landed back on the floor, He Zhou didn’t look back and
        only said two words: “Great shot.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at the ball with his arms still up in the air. As the
        ball sank in the net, he acted out his usual habit and pressed down
        three fingers along with the movement of the ball.
      </p>

      <p><em>Great shot.</em></p>

      <p><em>A one-point difference.</em></p>

      <p>
        In the last twelve seconds, everyone had gone completely mad. The
        audience in the stands all stood up, and waves of cheers washed over
        them one after another. Lao Xu started jumping up and down with
        excitement, waving his arms and shouting constantly from where he stood
        – not that anyone could hear what he was shouting. Even Lao Lu’s
        normally loud voice had been downright drowned out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Class 2 grabbed the ball and dashed towards the basket as if they were
        flying at the speed of light. Grasshopper tried making a shot with the
        ball before he even found a stable footing. Gu Fei also jumped but
        wasn’t able to block the shot and had only managed to poke the underside
        of the ball with his fingertip.
      </p>

      <p>
        The shot didn’t go in, and the fight for the rebound beneath the basket
        had become mayhem with everyone tangling together into a large mass –
        they might as well hugged. The feeling that “this is a boys’ basketball
        final match” had nearly gone pale and in a trance, Jiang Cheng had the
        illusion of being stuck in a rampage of aunties fighting for goods in a
        supermarket that had a 10% off sale.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ball still ended up being snatched by Class 2. They shot again, but
        this time Gu Fei blocked it, and the ball landed in Wang Xu’s hands.
      </p>

      <p>There were still four seconds left.</p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu had no time to make a pass. He dribbled the ball directly
        towards the opponent’s side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng followed after intending to cover him, but He Zhou seemed to
        have a firecracker lit beneath his ass – his speed was frighteningly
        quick. Before Wang Xu could even get close to the three-point line, he
        had already caught up. He stretched out his hand and slammed the ball
        away.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time Wang Xu pounced over and got the ball back in his hands, the
        whistle signaling the end of the match sounded before everyone present.
      </p>

      <p>“The match has ended——”</p>

      <p>Everyone in Class 2 jumped up, letting out deafening roars.</p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu stood still hugging the ball without moving an inch. Gu Fei
        walked over and patted his shoulder. When he suddenly whipped around and
        flung the ball aside, he tightly clung onto Gu Fei as he screamed and
        burst into tears.
      </p>

      <p>“The fuck?” Gu Fei froze with his arms in the air.</p>

      <p>
        “I was so close!” Wang Xu cried as he shouted, “I was so, so close!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’ve already done very well.” Gu Fei patted him on the back, “You’ve
        already done very well, don’t cry…”
      </p>

      <p>
        He Zhou exchanged a few high-fives with his teammates when he caught
        sight of this scene and froze. He ran over: “Did I… I don’t remember
        hitting him <em>ah</em>…”
      </p>

      <p>“You didn’t hit him,” Jiang Cheng reassured. “He’s just…”</p>

      <p>
        “Why did you slap my ball away?!” Wang Xu pushed Gu Fei aside and glared
        at He Zhou as he yelled at him.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ay!</em>” He Zhou jumped in fright, then took a step back, a little
        perplexed, “Of course I… have to slap it away <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Captain.” Jiang Cheng also felt a sense of loss and was a little
        regretful – they only lost by one point after all. But with Wang Xu’s
        current state, he had no time to mourn and simply sighed before walking
        over to check on Wang Xu. “Captain, Captain Wang?”
      </p>

      <p>“What is it?” Wang Xu looked at him.</p>

      <p>
        “Everyone’s looking at you <em>ne</em>.” Jiang Cheng said, “Hurry up and
        gather up, we still have to shake hands <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh right!” Wang Xu’s eyes widened, “I almost forgot! Hurry, hurry,
        hurry! Everyone in our team, come line up!”
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng breathed a sigh of relief.</p>

      <p>
        After the players on both teams shook hands and patted each other on the
        shoulders, they all returned to their respective resting areas.
      </p>

      <p>
        “That was wonderful!” Lao Xu came over to hug them all, “Absolutely
        wonderful! You guys are amazing! I’m so proud of you all!”
      </p>

      <p>
        When he walked in front of Jiang Cheng, Jiang Cheng hastily gave him a
        fist-palm salute and stepped back.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh you!!” Lao Xu pointed at him and sighed then moved on to grab Gu Fei
        into a hug, “Great job Gu Fei!”
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei smiled and didn’t say anything else.</p>

      <p>
        After Lao Xu left, he turned his head to look at Jiang Cheng. Jiang
        Cheng’s gaze held his for a while before he opened his arms with a
        smile, and Gu Fei closed in to give him a hug.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that moment, he no longer cared whether there were screams around
        them, whether someone would raise their phones towards them, or whether
        there would be a new post in the forum because of this scene.
      </p>

      <p>
        He just wanted to hug Gu Fei. Because of this match, because of this
        group of teammates that fought with everything they got, and because he
        and Gu Fei are the perfect partners – just hug him.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >A hug, that hug, carrying that young woman on the decorated, bridal
          palanquin…<a href="#_ftn3"><strong>[3]</strong></a></em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        “I haven’t played such an exhilarating game in a long time.” Gu Fei
        spoke.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Yeah,” Jiang Cheng agreed. “You just haven’t played a normal game
        <em>ba</em>?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… I have before.” Gu Fei let go of him, “I have to go to the washroom.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Have you been holding back the need to pee the entire time?” Jiang
        Cheng was a little speechless.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No.” Gu Fei grabbed his jacket and fished out the tissue adhesive, “I
        think the one on my waist also ripped open. I need to fix it up.”
      </p>

      <p>“Do you…” Jiang Cheng lowered his voice, “Need any help?”</p>

      <p>“No need,” Gu Fei laughed.</p>

      <p>
        The audience hadn’t completely dispersed yet. Some were shooting hoops
        on the court, some were ceaselessly chatting on the stands, while
        others… were taking pictures.
      </p>

      <p>“Jiang Cheng,” He Zhou ran over. “Do you want to play later?”</p>

      <p>
        “How about another day?” He glanced in the direction of the washroom,
        “Today…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Can’t!” Wang Xu suddenly came over, “No. Can. Do! We’re going to eat
        right now! We don’t have any time to play with you guys!”
      </p>

      <p>
        He Zhou hesitated for a while: “Alright then, let’s arrange another
        time. Let’s add each other on WeChat?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En.” Jiang Cheng took out his phone and added He Zhou to his friends
        list.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei returned not long after he went to the washroom. The players from
        the class and the cheerleading team were still in an incongruous state
        of excitement, sorrow, and joy.
      </p>

      <p>
        “There’s a lot of us!” Wang Xu was calling the restaurant to make a
        reservation, “Don’t you guys have one of those small conference rooms
        for meetings? Yes! That’s the one!”
      </p>

      <p>“How is it?” Jiang Cheng glanced at Gu Fei.</p>

      <p>“No problems.” Gu Fei moved his arm, “We’re going to eat together?”</p>

      <p>“En.” Jiang Cheng nodded, “You guys… what time?”</p>

      <p>“Eight o’clock tonight,” Gu Fei answered.</p>

      <p>
        Wang Xu took the group of them to a restaurant, including Li Yan who had
        an expression of unwillingness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sat next to Gu Fei once more, but neither of them spoke more
        than a few words throughout the entire meal. The group was so excited
        that they couldn’t be more excited; thank goodness there weren’t many
        customers eating in the restaurant at noon, otherwise they would have
        been driven away by their raging ruckus.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng wasn’t in the mood to talk anyway. Since he checked out
        those buildings the day before, he had fostered a faint sense of
        anxiousness toward Gu Fei and the others’ retarded building-jumping
        activity.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that the match was over, and he didn’t have any other matters on his
        mind, this feeling had time to fester and grow in his heart.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei would definitely get hurt, and very perceivably hurt at that. He
        <em>had</em> to get hurt. Otherwise, with Hou Zi’s disposition, even if
        Gu Fei admitted defeat, he had to get hurt for it to be acceptable.
      </p>

      <p><em>Then, this injury… what kind does it need to be?</em></p>

      <p><em>How utterly retarded.</em></p>

      <p>
        Even with chatting included with the eating, it also came with
        collective crying, and in the end, they also sang their hearts out to
        the song “Friends<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>”. Those who don’t know would
        think they were having an early farewell meal <em>ne</em>. This meal
        went on until past three o’clock in the afternoon before they finally
        disbanded. Jiang Cheng walked out of the restaurant when he felt like
        the sweat on his body had started to stink.
      </p>

      <p>
        Li Yan had his motorcycle and directly rode to Gu Fei’s shop while Jiang
        Cheng and Gu Fei pedaled their bikes back in silence the entire time.
      </p>

      <p>
        When they reached the entrance of the shop, Gu Fei finally said: “Be
        extra careful tonight. Stay where there’s not many people around.
        There’s going to be all sorts of people there.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I know.” Jiang Cheng glanced at him before letting out a sigh,
        “Whatever injury you’re going to sustain, be certain to… keep it within
        your grasp.”
      </p>

      <p>“Don’t worry,” Gu Fei smiled, “I grew up getting hurt.”</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng raised a middle finger at him, stepped on the pedal, and
        rode away.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first thing he did when he returned home was to take a shower, then
        after going out and walking around a few times, he bought a rubber tube
        and a pair of haemostatic forceps.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he first started playing with a slingshot, he had used a rubber
        tube. Nominally, this sort of rubber tube wasn’t the very best to use as
        a slingshot, but since he was used to it and was already quite familiar
        with how it stretched and rebounded – he continued to use it.
      </p>

      <p>
        After buying the rubber tube, he made his way to the supermarket. Being
        someone who lacked the knowledge of the layout of the market, he walked
        around for nearly ten rounds before he finally found a shop and bought a
        bag of walnuts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once he was finished with all of this, it wasn’t even five o’clock yet –
        still a long while before eight o’clock. Despite that, he stuffed
        everything into his schoolbag and headed to the railway bridge.
      </p>

      <p>
        He locked the bike on the rail outside of a small shop near the
        intersection, then walked in.
      </p>

      <p>
        This place looked more desolate during the day than at night. He
        directly walked up to the rooftop, put down his bag, and leaned against
        the wall of the small attic, and sank.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hello everyone, welcome to today’s Episode 2 of Cheng-<em>ge</em> Takes
        You To Watch The Retards.” Jiang Cheng removed the rubber band from the
        slingshot as he quietly narrated, “It is now… three hours from the
        Retards’ collective revelry. I estimate in about two hours, some
        retarded forerunners will enter the venue, so we have to arrive ahead of
        time… for now, I’ll take this time to teach everyone how to tie a rubber
        band on a slingshot…”
      </p>

      <p>
        He took out the rubber tube and forceps: “I normally use the 8-digit
        tying method. It’s very simple, all you need is a haemostatic forceps,
        or two knitting needles will work fairly well too… you guys can watch
        for yourself <em>ba</em>, I’m too lazy to explain it. I’m not in the
        mood.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The leather pad had just been changed recently and could still be used.
        Jiang Cheng lowered his head and quickly tied the rubber tube on the
        ‘slingshot’. Then he stretched it out to give it a try, released it, and
        felt that it wasn’t too shabby.
      </p>

      <p>
        He tilted his head back as he leaned against the wall, closed his eyes
        for a moment, then fished out a walnut from his backpack.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Last time we used steel bearing balls.” He stretched the rubber band
        and narrowed his eyes towards the four buildings on the other side.
        “Today, we’re going to test the strength of a walnut… of course, it’s
        not a paper-shell walnut, but the regular hard-shelled ones…”
      </p>

      <p>He loosened his hand, and the walnut flew out.</p>

      <p>
        An empty can was knocked off the edge of the rooftop on the opposite
        building and fell downstairs while the walnut also broke apart.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Not bad.” Jiang Cheng reached out to grab four walnuts, stood up, and
        moved two steps forward, “Let’s see how an acrophobic person overcomes
        their psychological… disorder, fuck, and hit four consecutive shots…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng took a deep break, aimed at a beverage bottle on the roof of
        the second building, and shot out the first walnut. The bottle was
        knocked forward. He shot out a second one, and the bottle was knocked
        forward again. Then a third one, and the fourth one.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fourth one was an empty shot, as the bottle had already been knocked
        across the building – the distance was a little too far.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Alright,” Jiang Cheng sat back by the wall, “All preparations have been
        finished. Now… may everyone study with me for now. We’ll resume in two
        hours.”
      </p>

      <p>
        He picked out a mathematics workbook that Pan Zhi had sent him, lowered
        his head, and started to read through it.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the sky had completely darkened and he could no longer clearly see
        what was in front of him, Jiang Cheng stuffed the book back in his
        backpack, and it was also then that he heard the sound of motorcycles
        sounding over from downstairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        The streetlights were already on and he edged over to the side of the
        rooftop and peered down; even though there were only two streetlights,
        he could still see that there were three motorcycles parked out there.
      </p>

      <p>Every motorcycle also carried a person – four men and two women.</p>

      <p>
        “Welcome everyone, the retarded forerunners have arrived at the venue.
        There’s actually two women.” Jiang Cheng quietly remarked, “I’ve never
        seen any of them before, but they should be members of the Retarded Hou
        Zi Team.”
      </p>

      <p>
        After those people dismounted their bikes, they didn’t go up the
        building. Instead, they remained standing at the bottom, laughing and
        chatting away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng glanced at the time – seven o’clock. He opened his messages
        and took a look at his and Gu Fei’s chat only to find that there were no
        new messages. Gu Fei didn’t contact him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He hesitated for a second before placing his phone back inside his
        pocket. It was pointless contacting Gu Fei at this time.
      </p>

      <p>
        After a little over ten minutes, the people downstairs started to
        increase. There were those who came on foot and those who came by
        motorcycle… all gathered together at the bottom of the buildings. Some
        were smoking, and others were carrying bottles of alcohol, drinking as
        they chatted. He stared at these them but didn’t see Bu Shi Hao Niao,
        that group of people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like this, Jiang Cheng remained squatting on the rooftop as he
        gazed downwards. He squatted till his leg was numb, and even squatted
        till he had forgotten that he had a fear of heights. When he finally
        caught sight of Li Yan driving in from a small path on the motorcycle
        from earlier that day.
      </p>

      <p>
        The crowd downstairs became restless; that restlessness seemed to soar,
        and the atmosphere suddenly became just a little tense.
      </p>

      <p>
        Following that were two more motorcycles. Jiang Cheng glanced at them;
        they were Bu Niao, and Hao Shi, exactly four people… then where was Gu
        Fei?
      </p>

      <p>
        After Li Yan and Bu Shi Hao Niao alighted their bikes, did he finally
        see Gu Fei’s motorcycle turning in.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fucking hell.” Jiang Cheng lowered his voice into a whisper as he
        announced, “Welcome friends and audience, please have your eyes on the
        one who has just entered the venue. That is Retard… Number 1. He’s
        riding a black motorcycle and wearing a… ‘night walking outfit’. He is
        now taking off his helmet… if we put aside the fact that he’s retarded,
        Number 1 truly is a very handsome fellow. This entrance deserves a score
        of 82 points, and the remaining 18 points are to be given out in the
        form of 666…”<a href="#_ftn5">[5]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei got off the bike, tossed the helmet to hang on the rearview
        mirror, and glanced at the surrounding people: “Where’s Hou Zi?”
      </p>

      <p>“He’ll be here soon,” somebody answered.</p>

      <p>“We’ll go up first.” Gu Fei glanced at Liu Fan.</p>

      <p>
        “En.” Liu Fan kicked aside an empty liquor bottle on the ground, and
        they entered the building together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was very familiar with this building because the people in the
        area around the steel mill had always keen on using hurdling as a method
        to resolve their conflicts. He couldn’t even remember how many times he
        had come here before, but this was the first time he came here to end
        his own conflict.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The people I’ve called over will arrive in a bit.” Liu Fan turned his
        head, “Li Yan, give Xu-<em>ge</em> a call <em>ba</em> and let him know
        to just come up here.”
      </p>

      <p>“Alright.” Li Yan took out his phone and dialed a number.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei walked at the very front all the way up to the rooftop; the wind
        was pretty forceful that day, immediately receiving a face full of wind
        just by standing on the rooftop.
      </p>

      <p>
        He looked at their surroundings before feeling around in both his
        pockets, retrieved a pair of glasses, and put it on.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Probably in the opposite building <em>ba</em>.” Li Yan whispered beside
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        He glanced at Li Yan then turned to look at the opposite building. It
        was pitch-black, and nothing could be seen at all. He couldn’t spot
        anything that appeared like a human figure on the rooftop either.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hou Zi came upstairs with a bunch of people. Now, the protagonists that
        day have all arrived and all the people who wanted to enjoy a good show
        have also gathered on the rooftops. One, two, three, four… Gu Fei
        glanced around and found that the rooftop of all four buildings was
        already packed with people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some were Hou Zi’s people, some were those that Liu Fan and them had
        called over, as well as quite a few audiences that just wanted to enjoy
        the show.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite the very fate that this conflict only pertained to him and Hou
        Zi, it was imperative for those people to all gather here. A boss like
        Hou Zi liked this sort of extravagance, yet what Gu Fei wanted was only
        witnesses.
      </p>

      <p>
        If he wanted to finish it all in one go, to never let there be another
        follow-up, there must be other people present. The more people, the
        better. As long as everybody knew that the conflict between the two of
        them was resolved right here, right now, if anybody came looking for
        trouble in the future, it would only be a matter of face. For someone
        like Hou Zi who had “status” and was a boss that needed face would have
        extreme difficulties if he wanted to make a move again.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Only</em>… Gu Fei pushed up his glasses and surveyed the crowds of
        people around him, attentively scanning across each and every rooftop,
        but still didn’t catch sight of Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was very familiar with Jiang Cheng’s silhouette. Even if this fellow
        mixed into the crowd, he would still be able to pick him out. But from
        beginning to end, he wasn’t able to find a trace of Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>On the opposite building?</em> It looked to be as peaceful as
        always.
      </p>

      <p>
        He felt a little insecure. After hesitating for some time, he ultimately
        took out his phone and sent Jiang Cheng a message.
      </p>

      <p>– Where are you?</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng replied incredibly fast.</p>

      <p>– Cheng-<em>ge</em> is everywhere.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck.” Gu Fei stared at the line of words and felt as if he could see
        Jiang Cheng’s smile stretched out beyond the three realms.
      </p>

      <p>– Just where are you? In the opposite building?</p>

      <p>
        There wasn’t a speck of light inside that building. However, if Jiang
        Cheng turned the brightness to the lowest setting, he still wouldn’t be
        able to see a hint of light from there.
      </p>

      <p>– Come to the edge of the roof.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei snuck a glance at Hou Zi. He was currently chatting with a bunch
        of people he hadn’t seen for a long time with a calm expression like
        nothing was happening that night.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei slowly walked over to the edge.</p>

      <p>
        Just as he lowered his head intending to send another message to Jiang
        Cheng, he suddenly felt something strike his shoe. He took a look at it
        and found that it was actually a walnut.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Fuck? You’ve hidden really well <em>ah</em>.” He immediately sent a
        voice message and went over to crush the walnut. That was when he also
        saw more smashed up walnut shells nearby, “What are you planning on
        doing?”
      </p>

      <p>– Smile for me.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng sent a message in response.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei turned his face towards the dilapidated building shrouded in
        darkness on the other side.
        <em>Smile for me, what the hell for?</em>
      </p>

      <p>– I can see you.</p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng sent another message over.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei took a panoramic glance at the crowd around him, and taking the
        chance while no one was looking, he turned back and smiled into the
        darkness.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was probably the most idiotic thing he had ever done in his entire
        life.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Very good.” Jiang Cheng squatted in the darkness. On the opposite
        rooftop, there were already some people using oil barrels to start a
        fire, brightening up the surroundings. “Just now, we saw Retard Number
        1’s smile which means the visibility and aiming conditions are perfect
        at the moment… it seems like the other side is about to begin. We’re
        going to start now.”
      </p>

      <p>
        With one leg bent at the knee and the other kneeling on the floor of the
        rooftop, he picked up a walnut and pulled the rubber band taught.
      </p>

      <p>
        The people on the rooftop had already spread out to either side. Gu Fei
        and Hou Zi both backed up to the very edge – the length of the run-up
        would be the length of the rooftop.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Holy fuck.” Jiang Cheng’s eyebrows furrowed; several empty bottles were
        kicked into the middle from both sides, and the path that Gu Fei would
        have to go through had at least three bottles. Following that, the items
        that were tossed out also included bricks and wooden slats, and the
        rooftop of the building they would land was also facing the same
        situation. Someone had actually gone out of their mind and also threw a
        case of beer in the middle. He clenched his teeth, “Really fucking
        retarded.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Someone walked to the middle and stood facing Hou Zi and Gu Fei and
        raised his hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was no possibility of Jiang Cheng calculating Gu Fei’s steps,
        consequently, no way for him to use the walnuts to clear away the
        roadblocks. Once they started, all he could do was to closely follow Gu
        Fei’s movement, calculate where his landing point was after he jumped,
        and make use of the time difference…
      </p>

      <p>The person in the middle finally swung his hand down hard.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei and Hou Zi rushed out at the same time.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t look down at his feet at all. Every step was taken with
        large strides, and when he rushed out whilst cloaked by the wind, he
        looked like he was about to fly.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng’s eyes locked on him fixedly.</p>

      <p>
        The moment Gu Fei took his first step, he could already make out with
        clarity Gu Fei’s state of letting loose – he wasn’t looking down at his
        feet, and only cared about striding forward.
      </p>

      <p>
        When Gu Fei stepped on the edge of the rooftop, at a position where he
        could fall if he moved forward just an inch, and suddenly leaped, Jiang
        Cheng’s heart stopped beating for a split second.
      </p>

      <p>
        The way Gu Fei dashed ahead regardless of all else, the way he leaped
        and soared through the air, his every movement as he embraced the wind,
        as if flying…
      </p>

      <p>
        “What kind of person are you?” Jiang Cheng yanked back the rubber sling,
        and as the walnut flew out once he loosened his hand, its target was the
        precisely empty bottle right by Gu Fei’s landing spot.
      </p>

      <p>The author has something to say: Continuing tomorrow.</p>

      <p>
        “The author who updates daily with no idea how the story is going to go
        discovered that she estimated wrongly. If we had gone with the normal
        word count, nothing would have happened. So to not get dissed by all the
        goldfish, she clenched my teeth and wrote 2000 more words in a frenzy to
        stir things up!” The author who has no more time to check for typos
        anymore says weakly as she lay on the black furry spirit.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Oh my god. o(≧口≦)o” The black furry spirit shouted as it pulled its
        hind legs from under the author’s belly.
      </p>

      <p>“Chirp. &amp;(ˉ^ˉ)&amp;” The tiny black furry spirit chirped.</p>

      <p>“w(゜Д゜)w Ying, ying.” The small black furry spirit cried.</p>

      <p>°</p>

      <p>The translators have something to say:</p>

      <p>
        Sae: It’s 4AM, technically 5AM (because we had daylight saving) and I’m
        dead tired T_____T
      </p>

      <p>Ice: IT’S. TIME. TO. WATCH. RETARDS.</p>

      <p>
        And damn Gu Fei is traumatized since the last time Jiang Cheng helped
        him with his wounds hahahahaha… (*&gt;艸&lt;)
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="entry-content">
      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Even though the first and second buildings were parallel, the distance
        between the two was the shortest.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Gu Fei couldn’t measure how far it was, but the people who had jumped
        over them in the past had landed more than one meter within the opposite
        rooftop.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The people that Liu Fan called had already scattered to the rooftops of
        the other buildings; matters such as setting up obstacles were also akin
        to a battlefield. If there was someone throwing things under his feet,
        naturally, there was also someone throwing things under Hou Zi’s feet.
        In this aspect, things were absolutely fair, and nobody would get beaten
        up for throwing things either.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        For these people, no matter who it was that won or lost, they would be
        excited. All they wanted to see was nothing more than someone tripping,
        getting hurt, and at the very best, someone falling off a building.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The noises beside his ears were very chaotic; there were people
        laughing, people shouting, and there were even women shrieking. It
        sounded a bit like how it was at the basketball game, but once he
        listened carefully, he could only sense darkness.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        These people… Gu Fei scrutinized his surroundings. These people were
        standing on all sorts of garbage that lied rotting on the rooftops;
        bags, beer bottles, food crumbs, and even used condoms could be seen
        here and there.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">This was indeed a brain-dead world.</p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        The only thing that caused him to do a double-take was the inconspicuous
        walnut pieces on the ground. This kind of garbage wasn’t something
        unusual on the rooftop, but if Jiang Cheng had never struck his shoes
        with one before, he would have never noticed these small broken pieces
        at his feet.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        These broken pieces were done by Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        <em>What is this xueba trying to do?</em>
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Even though he wasn’t concerned that Jiang Cheng would do something that
        took it too far, he still cared a little.
      </p>

      <p data-adtags-visited="true">
        Because no matter what Jiang Cheng wanted to do, it was all because of
        him.
      </p>

      <p>
        This retarded jumping building game also required a referee which was
        the so-called mediator. This person was someone that Gu Fei recognized
        and was considered a big boss before his retirement. Everyone called him
        Hu-<em
          >ge,<a href="#_ftn1"><strong>[1]</strong></a> </em
        >and with him calling out the start of this whole thing, it would appear
        relatively impartial.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although he had already retired, Hu-<em>ge </em>wasn’t that old in age –
        he wasn’t even 30. Gu Fei had even played basketball with him when he
        was in the reformatory school, and at that time, he had already washed
        his hands clean of the matters within the “Jianghu”. Yet, with the
        attitude of an experienced person, he had told him something along the
        lines of “repent and be saved”.
      </p>

      <p>Was this now considered, “repent and be saved”?</p>

      <p>
        He had never thought of wading into the waters, yet he had to carry the
        words “repent and be saved” on his back. It was rather funny now that he
        thought about it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei looked at the “roadblock” ahead. He didn’t calculate which steps
        should be taken with a wide stride, which steps should be avoided, and
        what must be done in order to get rid of something – he didn’t want to
        think about too many things.
      </p>

      <p>All he had to do was run, jump, and land.</p>

      <p>Getting injured meant the end, but no injuries meant continuing.</p>

      <p>
        He needed to make sure that if any injuries were to be sustained, it
        must be as late as possible. If an injury was received on the first
        landing, the insatiable audience might demand for him to continue with
        the injury.
      </p>

      <p>
        Moreover, he had already chosen the location and method of how he would
        get injured.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hu-<em>ge</em> raised his hand, and boisterous screams and whistles
        sounded on the rooftops, echoing out in all directions.
      </p>

      <p>His arm then flew down right after.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t care if Hou Zi had set off yet or how he had set off. He
        only fixed his gaze on the edge of the roof and charged.
      </p>

      <p><em>You said one, two, three, shatter the past… </em></p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s right foot slammed firmly on the very edge of the roof, and his
        body was wrapped in the wind as he jumped.
      </p>

      <p>Beneath was the darkness, ahead was the blazing brightness.</p>

      <p>
        Where there were dancing flames and shadows that intertwined between
        light and darkness.
      </p>

      <p>
        The instant he soared in the air, Gu Fei suddenly felt relaxed. He had
        the urge to scream out loud at the top of his lungs, and he also wanted
        to laugh.
      </p>

      <p>The corners of his lips pulled back.</p>

      <p>
        The spot he wanted to land on had already been determined in advance.
        This strong jump aided him in surpassing the case of broken beer bottles
        that were thrown near the end of the roof.
      </p>

      <p>This meant that the two beverage bottles could also be avoided.</p>

      <p>
        The result of stepping on those beverage bottles wouldn’t necessarily
        make you twist your ankle, however, it would make you lose your balance.
        If one were to slip under such great momentum, the consequences would be
        uncontrollable.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, at the same time as when he had just started to drop down, a beer
        bottle suddenly rolled over from the side.
      </p>

      <p>
        This bottle that was rolling to his landing point made Gu Fei’s heart
        drop.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was no longer any other way nor any time for him to take control
        of his body. If his foot stepped on the bottle…
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck you.</em></p>

      <p>Gu Fei closed his eyes.</p>

      <p><em>Fuck your mother, come what may ba.</em></p>

      <p>
        A walnut struck the bottle hard, hitting close to the mouth of the
        bottle, and practically sped up at exactly the same time that Gu Fei’s
        feet landed, rolling away right beneath his feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei’s posture was very beautiful as he landed – he didn’t stagger and
        was steady and firm. He stood up quickly after borrowing the momentum to
        lightly roll on the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng let out a very long sigh of relief amid the clamorous noises
        of whistles and iron rods hitting empty oil barrels and sat his butt
        down on the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Amazing.” After relaxing for two seconds, he took out two more walnuts.
        “As everyone can see, taking deep breaths has proven to help ease
        tension and fear… fuck.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng’s hands shook uncontrollably; the walnut slipped out of his
        hand twice as he tried to hold it against the rubber band: “It can be
        seen that this is the first time contestant Jiang Cheng has made shots
        under such tremendous pressure. His hands are trembling so badly… that
        he can’t even hold onto his weapon.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Actually, even my legs are shaking.” Jiang Cheng bent at the waist and
        moved his hands and feet toward the side of the small attic. This spot
        was slightly closer to the second building, and under this kind of
        light, it would be even more stable if he was a meter closer in
        distance. He rested his knees on the concrete piers at the edge of the
        roof, “I really want to pee <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was not injured, nor was Hou Zi. By comparison, Gu Fei had jumped
        further and had a much more beautiful landing posture than Hou Zi.
      </p>

      <p>But this was only the first round.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng looked at the situation of the rooftop of the second
        building through the fork of the slingshot. At the moment, it looked as
        though they were waiting for the people from the first building to go
        down, thus everyone was moving about.
      </p>

      <p>
        A few minutes later, Jiang Cheng heard the sound of music coming from
        the other side.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em
          >“Obviously he’s a fool, but full of goodness, always dreaming of

          ></em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        With just a listen, one could feel a strong sense of the aura of a
        rural-urban type hair salon.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This really is…” Jiang Cheng couldn’t hold back a <em>tsk</em>,
        “Unbelievable…”<a href="#_ftn3">[3]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        These sorts of retarded country bumpkins with their “swag” rendered him
        utterly speechless. They and the idiots that thought that they were the
        absolute baddest with two speakers hanging from their motorcycles must
        have a master-apprentice relationship.<a href="#_ftn4">[4]</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei said a few words to Li Yan who had come from the first building,
        lit a cigarette, then stood at the side of the rooftop looking ahead.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng also took out a cigarette, hunched his back, and pulled his
        clothes together to block the wind as he speedily lit it and took a
        drag.
      </p>

      <p>
        He then sat down on the side of the rooftop and looked over at Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        From when Gu Fei first jumped to the landing ‘till now, his frantic
        heartbeat had gradually calmed down already, and he could quietly look
        at Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        There wasn’t any expression on Gu Fei’s face. He was just there with a
        cigarette in his mouth as if he was looking at something, but also like
        he was spacing out.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Chang also spaced out with him.</p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was not like all the others. He was different from those people
        who constantly sought the thrill and excitement in their life. From the
        very first step that he took, Jiang Cheng felt it.
      </p>

      <p>
        What Gu Fei wanted wasn’t “I won”, nor was it the screams or the
        attention – all he wanted was for this all to end.
      </p>

      <p>
        The end of his dispute with Hou Zi, and the end of the past that he had
        dully mentioned the other day.
      </p>

      <p>
        No one had noticed the sudden increase in speed the bottle had taken,
        and neither had anyone taken notice of the walnut that had been
        shattered to pieces at the side of his feet due to impact with the
        ground and the bottle.
      </p>

      <p>
        It happened way too fast. Even Gu Fei himself had only become aware of
        the reason he didn’t step on that bottle when his hand touched upon the
        bits of walnut shells on the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        At that second, he really, really wanted to send a message to Jiang
        Cheng, to take a look at the building to the side, but he didn’t dare.
      </p>

      <p>
        Under such circumstances, his every reaction would be immediately
        noticed and as long as he looked over there, someone would perhaps go
        that way.
      </p>

      <p>
        He stared at the walnut that had already become like fine powder from
        having been kicked and stepped on by the people walking up and down –
        not knowing what to feel.
      </p>

      <p>
        He didn’t want to drag Jiang Cheng into these matters, yet Jiang Cheng
        still appeared using this method of “not getting involved”.
      </p>

      <p><em>Cheng-ge is everywhere</em>.</p>

      <p>
        Those words that carried the aura of the infamous “middle school
        syndrome” practically oozed from the screen and flooded onto one’s face,
        now made a wave of warmth suddenly wash over his heart when he recalled
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The feeling that Jiang Cheng brought him wasn’t just something as simple
        as “outstanding”; the purity that glimmered like crystals buried
        underneath his “middle school syndrome” aura that reached the sky and
        his occasional small tantrums would never fail to slightly move one’s
        heart every time it flashed by the corner of one’s eye in this chaotic
        and disorderly life.
      </p>

      <p>
        “The retards are starting to clear the area.” Jiang Cheng straightened
        up with one knee still on the ground. Actually, no one on the opposite
        building would even take notice if he stood up, and his visibility would
        also improve a bit too. But standing on the edge of the rooftop of a
        five-story building in the darkness of the night with the wind also
        blowing… he honestly couldn’t bring himself to do it. He pulled the
        rubber band back tightly. “It looks like the second round is about to
        start… shit, I’m going to stop talking. May everyone see for yourselves
        <em>ba</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The third building was one story lower than the second building and the
        distance between them was also quite further… Jiang Cheng could feel his
        palms perspiring and couldn’t help but be thankful that his slingshot
        had top-tier anti-slipping attributes. If it was a substandard product
        like the one they used during the photoshoot that day, the slingshot
        would probably fly out of his hands along with the walnuts.
      </p>

      <p>
        The retards, a story below, had started throwing things toward the
        center again. Even a few burning sticks were also thrown into the mix,
        though doing so had tremendously increased the visibility.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng slowed down his breathing and aimed at a wooden stick on the
        rooftop of the third building. Aside from the bricks and liquor bottles,
        that piece of wood that lay parallel to Gu Fei’s running path was the
        most dangerous. If he happened to step on it, the chances of his ankle
        getting twisted was a hundred percent. It would have been much better if
        it lay across, that way, even if he stepped on it, his ankle wouldn’t
        twist to either side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like before, someone stood in the middle with their hand raised,
        facing Gu Fei and Hou Zi.
      </p>

      <p>His hand then swung down right after.</p>

      <p>
        The two charged out at the same time. Gu Fei flew off the edge of the
        rooftop with the same posture and the same speed as before.
      </p>

      <p>
        Because the distance was wider, Jiang Cheng could even see Gu Fei’s leg
        take a stride in the air, allowing his body to prolong the acceleration.
      </p>

      <p>
        If it wasn’t for the fact that he was really too nervous, Jiang Cheng
        would have definitely applauded Gu Fei for his explosively cool move –
        such long legs, such a beautiful stride and jump…
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was right then that a commotion appeared on the rooftop of the
        third building that Jiang Cheng had been constantly keeping an eye on –
        he never would’ve expected that such a situation would occur!
      </p>

      <p>
        Wooden boards, sticks, and several other inexplicable things that were
        impossible to distinguish had been thrown from both sides into the air
        above the rooftop.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck! Your! Whole! Family!</em></p>

      <p>
        The shock and indignation that rose within Jiang Cheng at that moment
        simply eclipsed any other in his life – reaching its highest peak. He
        almost wanted to take out the steel bearing balls and welt them on the
        heads of anyone on either side, and most fitting was if it pierced all
        the way through so that those brains that clearly lack oxygen could
        fucking take in some fresh air!
      </p>

      <p>
        But he didn’t have time to think anymore. He even wanted to express his
        gratitude to those hyper-excited fools who had thrown things in advance.
        If they had started throwing when Gu Fei was landing from the jump, the
        possibility of him reacting in time would have been impossible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Between expelling the obstacles beneath his feet or the ones sailing in
        the air, Jiang Cheng chose the ones in the air.
      </p>

      <p>
        With all sorts of rubbish obstructing his view, he couldn’t clearly
        discern the situation around Gu Fei’s landing spot. He held his breath –
        there was no time to think.
      </p>

      <p>
        A slingshot wasn’t a gun, and a walnut wasn’t a bullet. He couldn’t let
        something fly toward Gu Fei before making a move. He had no other option
        but to make use of the split second he had to pinpoint the object deemed
        most destructive to Gu Fei.
      </p>

      <p>
        The difficulty of this approach was an endeavor he had practically never
        undertaken. His mind was a chaotic mess that parroted the tumultuous
        noises of the opposite side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Someone in the crowd had picked up a piece of broken brick. Jiang Cheng
        promptly yanked back the rubber band at the same time that the guy flung
        it.
      </p>

      <p>
        His timing wasn’t that much of a problem, but he could only estimate for
        the angle.
      </p>

      <p>
        The brick deviated just as it closed in on Gu Fei’s face and smacked
        against a piece of wooden plank that flew over from the side.
        Consequently, the wooden plank veered off course, only sweeping by Gu
        Fei’s face before flying elsewhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei didn’t even wince during the whole ordeal. In this utterly
        confusing and disorderly situation, he looked as though he wasn’t aware
        of anything. Only when the wooden plank swept by his face did Jiang
        Cheng see him sway a little.
      </p>

      <p><em>Fuck!</em></p>

      <p>There were probably nails on the wooden plank.</p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng no longer had any time to clear the obstacles under Gu Fei’s
        feet. He could only look on helplessly as Gu Fei set foot on the roof of
        the other building, stumbled sideways in the pile of junk, and rolled to
        the side.
      </p>

      <p>Then everything in the air followed suit.</p>

      <p>
        The fact that nothing heavy smashed into his head, Gu Fei could guess it
        was all because of Jiang Cheng.
      </p>

      <p>
        But he still stepped on something when he landed and felt his left foot
        suddenly twist outward.
      </p>

      <p><em>That’s it then.</em></p>

      <p>
        He gritted his teeth and used his right foot that was immediately
        landing on the ground to kick against the ground, before rolling to the
        left with the momentum.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ground was in complete disarray. He couldn’t feel any pain at all in
        those brief seconds. There were most likely injuries on his arms and
        legs, but he was already unable to confidently ascertain where.
      </p>

      <p>
        When the rolling finally ceased, he propped his hand on an empty can to
        the side.
      </p>

      <p>
        The feeling of his palm being cut open by the edge of the can was
        extremely vivid. He loosened some of the pressure on his palm and fell
        to the other side.
      </p>

      <p>
        Liu Fan was the first to rush over and crouched down beside him: “Where
        are you hurt?!”
      </p>

      <p>“… my leg.” Gu Fei’s brows tightened as he held his left calf.</p>

      <p>
        “Is it broken?” Li Yan kicked away the pile of junk beside him and
        stretched his hand out to touch his calf.
      </p>

      <p>“Ah!” Gu Fei screamed in pain, “… don’t move it.”</p>

      <p>
        The crowd of people gathered around then – each and every one of them
        carried a face full of excitement.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other side, Hou Zi had also fallen pretty hard. Gu Fei could see
        someone pulling him up from the ground, and that even though Hou Zi’s
        footing slightly swayed, he was still able to stand. Confirming that, he
        suddenly let out a sigh of relief and collapsed back down on the ground.
      </p>

      <p><em>This is it.</em></p>

      <p><em>Finally.</em></p>

      <p><em>It’s over.</em></p>

      <p>
        “You okay?” Hou Zi shook off the people that supported him and slowly
        walked toward Gu Fei through the path that the crowd paved, then leaned
        over to look at him.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei didn’t say anything.</p>

      <p>“His leg seems to be broken,” someone called out from the side.</p>

      <p>
        “Really?” A smile immediately appeared on Hou Zi’s face. He then looked
        at Gu Fei’s legs. “Is it this one? It’s all twisted?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Before anyone could speak, he kicked Gu Fei in the leg: “Pretty serious
        <em>huh</em>?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei shrunk back abruptly and curled into a ball to the side in pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Let’s end it here <em>ba</em>.” Liu Fan stood up and blocked himself in
        front of Hou Zi. “If you accept to bet, you must accept to lose.<a
          href="#_ftn5"
          >[5]</a
        >
        This time Da Fei lost.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “What a pity <em>ah</em>.” Hou Zi was cradling his arm; even though
        blood was flowing down his forehead, sheer delight was plastered across
        his face. “I thought this kid could play with me all the way to the
        second building.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Liu Fan didn’t respond to his provocation but instead looked over at
        Xu-<em>ge </em>who had just walked over from the other rooftop.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Hu-<em>ge</em>, what do you say?” Xu-<em>ge </em>asked Hu-<em>ge</em>
        who hadn’t said anything the entire time.
      </p>

      <p>“He really can’t get up?” Someone shouted.</p>

      <p>
        The indication of those words was evident – as long as Gu Fei could
        still stand up, this matter would never end.
      </p>

      <p>
        Hu-<em>ge</em> walked over to Gu Fei and crouched down beside him and
        looked at his calf that could clearly be seen to be deformed even
        through the pants. But for safety measures, he still reached out and
        gripped the spot of the fracture and pressed down his finger.
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei took in a sharp inhale, unable to make a sound.</p>

      <p>Hu-<em>ge</em> stared fixedly at him, not saying a word.</p>

      <p>Gu Fei’s brows twisted as their eyes met.</p>

      <p>
        A few seconds later, Hu-<em>ge </em>loosened his hand and stood up: “His
        leg is broken.”
      </p>

      <p>
        An uproar of complaints compounded with dissatisfaction resounded all
        around.
      </p>

      <p>
        “This hurdling session today was a method that the both of you had
        decided out of your own free will, to settle the conflicts once and for
        all. You must bear the consequences of your actions, and everyone
        present is a witness to this,” Hu-<em>ge</em> said. “Any grudges between
        you two have now been settled, is there an issue with that?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Hu<em>-ge</em> glanced over at Hou Zi, who then looked down at Gu Fei
        who was still lying on the ground: “There’s no issues.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is there an issue with that?” Hu-<em>ge </em>looked at Gu Fei again.
      </p>

      <p>“No,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>
        “Go to the hospital <em>ba</em>.” Hu-<em>ge</em> waved his hand, “After
        this, you each go your own ways.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng leaned against the wall of the small attic, unsure of how
        badly injured Gu Fei was. He only knew that Gu Fei couldn’t stand, and
        even at this distance, he could tell that Gu Fei’s hand was soaked in
        blood.
      </p>

      <p>
        He couldn’t clearly make out anything that the people on the opposite
        side were saying. But it was clear as day to him that his entire body
        had gone soft; his hands were shaking badly, and his back was covered in
        cold sweat. The scene of Gu Fei falling heavily on the ground and
        rolling to the side flashed repeatedly in front of his eyes.
      </p>

      <p>
        That fall was so heavy and terrible, he could practically feel the pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        After Liu Fan put Gu Fei on his back, he didn’t dare to look over there
        again and lit a stick of cigarette.
      </p>

      <p>
        In any case, suffering an injury was inevitable. If it was just a broken
        leg, that was already an ideal outcome.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei ended some things with this stoical, fearless, and explicitly
        indifferent way – things that perhaps many people might not even think
        needed to be rushed to be solved now.
      </p>

      <p>
        The moment he flew into the air without scruples and firmly stepped
        forward, Jiang Cheng felt that he had no desire to think about anything
        anymore.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fear, tension, and worry he endured at that moment was incomparable
        to anything he had ever felt in his life. He had never been gripped by
        such a strong feeling of panic ever before.
      </p>

      <p>
        The people on the other side had long dispersed; there were only a few
        left that were still getting their bikes downstairs, readying to set
        out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng sat against the wall of the small attic, having already
        smoked three cigarettes.
      </p>

      <p>
        He snubbed out the cigarette butt and started to gather his belongings,
        intending to wait until everyone was gone before he went down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just then, his phone sounded. He felt like it didn’t take even a second
        for him to pull out his phone. <em>Damn, the speed of this hand.</em>
      </p>

      <p>Gu Fei had sent him a message.</p>

      <p>– I’m fine.</p>

      <p>This kind of useless comfort made Jiang Cheng simply want to curse.</p>

      <p>– Where are you?</p>

      <p>– In the shop, come over.</p>

      <p>
        <em>Come, my ass!</em> Jiang Cheng was struck speechless.
        <em
          >His legs have already become like that and he didn’t even bother
          going to the hospital?! He actually went back to the shop?! Or did he
          just go to the community hospital to get it treated?</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng didn’t respond to Gu Fei’s messages anymore. He picked up
        his things and leaned over to the edge of the rooftop to glance down –
        there was no one there.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was precisely this glance that made him suddenly be overcome with
        a bout of vertigo. Perhaps the sudden relaxation of his nerves that had
        been pulled tight the entire time and the fear brought by the height of
        this five-story building had now crashed upon him like a wave – making
        it feel more intense than usual.
      </p>

      <p>
        He became weak in the knees and sat down at the edge of the rooftop,
        taking a long while before he finally recovered.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Shit!” He cursed quietly. He turned around and knelt on the ground,
        dragging his schoolbag behind him as he slowly crawled toward the
        stairway that led down. “Fuck, ten thousand alpacas<a href="#_ftn6"
          >[6]</a
        >
        flew across buildings in contestant Jiang Cheng’s mind. He must be
        ecstatic that no one is here to see him cower in fear…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Before he stepped out of the building, Jiang Cheng surveyed the area
        once more through the window, and after confirming that there was
        absolutely nobody around, he finally left.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a significant increase in garbage downstairs, many of which
        were thrown down from the roofs of the buildings – it looked like a
        disaster had occurred. An oil barrel had also been kicked to the ground,
        and the wood inside that hadn’t been burned to ashes still flickered
        with flame in the middle of the road.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng walked slowly through the utter mess of things and kicked a
        few large pieces of wood that was burning into the ditch on the side of
        the road.
      </p>

      <p>
        There were only a few streetlights near where the buildings were
        situated, and after a turn, only the moonlight accompanied him on the
        road.
      </p>

      <p>
        When he finally walked all the way to the intersection only to see the
        backseat of his bike – for some inexplicable reason – smashed until it
        was crooked, he could feel his own legs becoming a little sore.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Come on.</em> He had just finished a basketball match then had to
        kneel on a rooftop the entire time… but by comparison, Retard No. 1’s
        legs were indeed in a more miserable state… he knitted his brows, got on
        his bike, and hurriedly sped off.
      </p>

      <p>
        He was as fast as lightning on the way there, riding his bike as if he
        was in an F1 race. When he saw the lights from Gu Fei’s shop emerge in
        his line of sight, he finally gradually slowed down.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng shoved the bike to the side of the road, and without even
        bothering to lock it, he rushed toward the shop. When he lifted the
        sheet curtain, he had already seen that the retractable door was halfway
        down, but his movements failed to keep up with his brain, and he slammed
        into the door with a bang.
      </p>

      <p>
        “<em>Ai</em>!” Gu Fei’s startled voice sounded from within the shop,
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Your grandfather Jiang!” Jiang Cheng yelled as he bent down to get into
        the shop. The moment he looked up, he saw Gu Fei standing at the doorway
        of the inner room.
      </p>

      <p>
        The left leg of his pants was rolled up to the knee and his calf was
        wrapped neatly with gauzes and splints. Thick layers of gauze were also
        present around his hand along with a patch on his face.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng gaped at him. It took him a long time to finally react, and
        when he spoke, it was with an extremely affectionate tone that sounded
        like he was saying, ‘I really do deeply sympathize with you retards’.
        “<em>You’re</em> still standing <em>ne~</em>? Why don’t
        <em
          >you<a href="#_ftn7"><strong>[7]</strong></a></em
        >
        just start dancing right now <em>ah~</em>?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei was stunned for up to ten seconds before he suddenly burst into
        laughter, leaning against the door frame as he laughed to the point
        where he was unable to extricate himself.
      </p>

      <p>
        “What the fucking hell are you laughing about!” Jiang Cheng pointed at
        him, consumed with anger, “Believe it or not, I’ll beat the shit out of
        you if you keep on laughing! You fucking dumbass!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>.” Gu Fei grabbed his hand and held it down,
        “Cheng-<em>ge</em>, I’m fine.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “You’re only fucking fine if something happens to you! Retard No. 1!”
        Jiang Cheng cursed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I really am fine though.” Gu Fei raised his left leg and knocked it
        against the doorframe a few times, “I’m not…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “The fuck?” Jiang Cheng almost wanted to stretch out his hands to catch
        his own falling eyeballs. “What’s the meaning of this?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I didn’t suffer any serious injuries.” Gu Fei raised his right hand
        that was wrapped up in gauze, “It’s only my hand and a few scrapes. My
        leg is perfectly intact.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Jiang Cheng stared at him, feeling as though he couldn’t return to his
        senses: “Your leg is fine?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “En,” Gu Fei went to pull down the retractable door to the shop and then
        entered the inner room. “I…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Is it really ‘fine’?” Jiang Cheng saw that he really did seem, unlike
        somebody who had injured their leg with the way he was walking around.
        He suddenly felt an indescribable feeling of excitement – just as if he
        had lost a thousand RMB only to find the money floating in the washing
        machine.
      </p>

      <p>“Really,” Gu Fei smiled.</p>

      <p>
        “Fuck, really?” Jiang Cheng went over and hit his leg a couple of times,
        “Fuck!”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Really, really, really, really,” Gu Fei reassured. “Stop worrying.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “But I clearly saw your leg…” Jiang Cheng gestured with his hands,
        “Become like <em>that</em> ah!”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei picked up a steel bar that was bent in the center and lying
        against the wall: “It’s this. This is what I used to prevent twisting my
        ankle and…”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Holy shit.” Jiang Cheng took it for a look, “This little brother, your
        acting skill is pretty amazing <em>ah</em>.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “I did think that I’d probably break a bone somewhere, but I didn’t
        expect to still be okay even after falling and rolling a few times like
        that,” Gu Fei said. “So, I could only act.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “Didn’t someone examine your injury, I clearly saw it?” Jiang Cheng
        repeatedly examined the steel bar, “He didn’t find that your entire leg
        was still connected?”
      </p>

      <p>
        “He probably noticed it,” Gu Fei leaned back against the headboard, “But
        didn’t say anything.”
      </p>

      <p>
        “… we should present him with a silk banner tomorrow and express our
        gratitude to the selfless model citizen like Lei Feng.”<sup>3</sup>
      </p>

      <p>“Thank you,” Gu Fei said.</p>

      <p>“For what?” Jiang Cheng’s gaze fell on him.</p>

      <p>
        “Thank you for shooting with such accuracy,”<a href="#_ftn8">[8]</a> Gu
        Fei laughed.
      </p>

      <p>
        “… it’s nothing.” Jiang Cheng waved his hand. “I was almost… scared to
        death.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei continued to laugh his heart out. Jiang Cheng shot him another
        look, “Are you going to laugh like a fool again? In any case, we’re
        people who are about to step into the ranks of adults, so can you…”
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei laughed even harder as he pressed the wound on his face, and
        Jiang Cheng was pulled in the laughing fit with him so he couldn’t even
        finish what he was saying. He sat down on a nearby chair and laughed
        wildly facing the ground.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was like celebrating, yet also venting his anger at the same time…
        but it was truly because he felt joy and relief from the fact that Gu
        Fei’s leg wasn’t actually hurt.
      </p>

      <p>
        After recovering from their laughter, neither of them spoke, letting the
        silence sink in.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gu Fei leaned against the headboard and let out a quiet sigh of relief.
      </p>

      <p>Jiang Cheng lowered his head and used his hand to rub at his face.</p>

      <p>
        “You’re not crying, are you?” Gu Fei turned his head to look at him and
        sat upright.
      </p>

      <p>
        “No.” With his head lowered, Jiang Cheng clasped his hands together and
        clenched them back and forth. Only after a long time did he finally
        raised his head back up and took a deep breath. “Gu Fei.”
      </p>

      <p>“En?” Gu Fei sounded in response.</p>

      <p>
        “Have you ever thought of…” Jiang Cheng said with some difficulty, but
        he didn’t make a single pause or show a shred of hesitation, “Getting a
        boyfriend?”
