      Yan Xie got out of the police car and slowly crossed his arms as he eyed
      the shop sign before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma Xiang went up to greet him, “Yan-ge, the one who reported the case is
      over there, we just-”
    </p>
    <p>Yan Xie interrupted Ma Xiang with a wave of his hand.</p>
    <p>
      “Inform the field teams that the search for second-hand shops is over,” he

    <p>
      A few police officers were locking down the shop entrance. The

      <span title="店主" class="word">shopkeeper</span> was exchanging words

      black and yellow backpack into an evidence bag and was just starting to
      lift fingerprints for comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the <span class="word" title="人行道">sidewalk</span> outside the
      store, a police officer was recording a statement from Jiang Ting, who was
      seated on a bench. He was

      to rise even when Yan Xie walked over.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A friend of mine wanted to get rid of her unused handbag, so I came out
      to have a look around with her and

      that backpack on the sales counter. It
      <span title="/ strʌk / 打接 罢工 撞上" class="word">struck</span>

    </p>
    <p>
      “The shop owner told me that you

      >
      through the bag before calling the police. What was that about?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I only wanted to see what it contained.” Jiang Ting’s voice
      <span
        title="支支吾吾的 蹒跚，踉跄；犹豫，踌躇；  / ˈfɔːltər / "
        class="word"
        >faltered</span

      a bit. “A few small pieces of

      in the front pockets of the bag. They looked a bit like chocolate
      wrappers. Maybe you should get forensics to give it a
      <span class="word" title="检查">lookover</span>.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As a police officer, he was used to members of the public making
      <span

      <span class="word" title="/ ɡrʌnt / 发出哼声，嘟哝着说；发出咕噜声"

      in response to Jiang Ting’s words. Unexpectedly, someone
      <span class="word" title="/ pæt / 轻拍 pat">patted</span>
      him on the shoulder. “Hey, Vice-Captain Yan!”
    </p>
    <p>Yan Xie gestured with his hand and said, “Leave this to me.”</p>
    <p>
      The officer let out a surprised “oh” and handed over the statement records
      to him before heading off to
      <span class="word" title="帮助，协助；参加，出席">assist</span> the
      others.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Yan Xie showed no interest towards the records he held in his
      hands. Crossing his arms, he stood before Jiang Ting and stared at the
      <span class="word" title="/ ˈlætər / 两者之中的）后者的；末期的，后期的"

    </p>
    <p>“Hello, Officer Yan,” Jiang Ting greeted politely.</p>
    <p>
      “The police bureau has yet to offer rewards, yet you’re providing us with
      leads this early. What a shame.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jiang Ting’s lips
      <span class="word" title="/ kɜːrvd/ 弯曲的；弄弯的">curved</span>. “What

    <p>
      The two of them looked at each other, one standing and the other one
      sitting. The

      expression, Jiang Ting replied, “You’re overthinking it, Officer. This
      shop offers better prices as compared to the others.”

    <p>
      A forensics officer hurried over to the

      analysis. One more thing—according to the shopkeeper, this bag was brought
      over and sold at a low price by a man on the 3rd of May, at around eight
      in the morning. He was holding a Toyota car key. We are attempting to

    </p>
    <p>“What about the store’s surveillance videos?”</p>
    <p>“We’re working on it. It should be done soon.”</p>
    <p>Yan Xie was silent.</p>
    <p>
      “There’s just this one issue, Vice-Captain Yan,” the officer voiced

      amount of time. What should we do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as Yan Xie listened to the report, his gaze was focused intently upon
      Jiang Ting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jiang Ting
      <span class="word" title="v. fold 折叠；交叉合拢">folded</span> his hands
      on his lap and returned Yan Xie’s gaze quietly.
    </p>
    <p>“Ma Xiang,” Yan Xie called.</p>

      before him. “Here!”

      “The street surveillance footage I requested previously, was there a

      Both the officer and Ma Xiang left swiftly, leaving both Jiang Ting and

    </p>
    <p>
      “You have nothing to your name?” Yan Xie retorted immediately. “Can a
      person with nothing to their name stay one step ahead of the police?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can’t help that it’s a coincidence,” Jiang Ting replied, a trace of

      colouring his tone.

      The next few seconds passed in silence, their gazes locked onto each
      other. It was Yan Xie who broke the silence first.

      “Feng Yuguang was a post-graduate student from a

      <span class="word" title="/ˈekstəsi/ ecstasy 摇头丸;狂喜;迷幻药;陶醉;入迷"

    <p>
      But the change in his expression only lasted for a millisecond. Following
      that, he <span class="word" title="v. 显示;透露">revealed</span> a more

      between laughter and tears, and said, “Officer Yan, even though I’ve never

      >
      isn’t the only drug in the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening his mouth, Yan Xie appeared to have another
      <span class="word" title="/rɪˈtɔːrt/">retort</span> ready on the tip of
      his tongue, but Jiang Ting interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know how I offended you to arouse your suspicions so, but since
      you’re so close to uncovering the murderer, then there’s no need to

    </p>
    <p>
      “Didn’t you mention previously that you wanted to break up with your
      girlfriend and return to your hometown?”
    </p>
    <p>“…”</p>
    <p>
      “Wait here,” Yan Xie
      <span class="word" title="命令;指挥，">commanded</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on his heel and walked away just as a forensic image analyst
      happened to
      <span class="word" title="出现;浮现;显现;暴露;露出;">emerge</span> from
      the backend of the second-hand store. The forensic image analyst waved Yan
      Xie over instantly. “Vice-Captain Yan, we found it! A white Toyota Camry
      passed by the crime scene on the day Case 502 happened and only left this
      street at half-past-8 the next morning. This is the surveillance footage

    <p>“They can’t identify him…”</p>

      The forensic image analyst carefully explained, “He was driving a car…

    </p>
    <p>
      He did not utter a single word, but his jaw muscles visibly tightened and
      the lines of his shoulders were stretched taut beneath his shirt, like a
      drawn bowstring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody dared to speak for a long time until the sound of footsteps came to
      a stop behind Yan Xie. It was followed up by Jiang Ting’s amiable tone of
      voice as he asked, “Officer Yan, if there’s nothing else, may I take my
      leave?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie’s arm shot out and—under the startled gaze of the forensic
      analyst—grabbed hold of Jiang Ting’s shoulders, tugging him into his
      embrace before the latter had a chance to react. Waving the photo he had
      just obtained in Jiang Ting’s face, Yan Xie asked, “Recognise him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      In the few seconds that passed after, Jiang Ting could feel Yan Xie’s
      fiery glare scorching a trail down his skin. Dropping his gaze, Jiang Ting
      casted a cursory glance over the photo presented to him before turning an
      aggrieved look towards Yan Xie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How am I supposed to recognise him? Don’t the police usually investigate
      vehicles with past records in the system first before moving on to the
      criminals? I can’t even be considered an eyewitness to the crime.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie finally released Jiang Ting and gave his shoulder an energetic
      pat. “You’re not allowed to leave.”
    </p>
    <p>Another questioning look was thrown in his direction.</p>
    <p>
      “You’re considered a person of interest and hence forbidden to leave the
      state. You must remain in Jianning until the case is resolved.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jiang Ting’s expression stiffened. Contrarily, Yan Xie turned around with
      a skip in his step. With the air of a general who had just achieved a
      great victory, Yan Xie walked towards the police car with large strides.
      Waving the photo in his hand, he raised his voice and called out, “Let’s
      wrap it up and head back to the bureau! The forensics team are to return
      to the lab to continue investigating the evidence and conduct a thorough
      inspection of suspicious vehicles and anyone with a previous criminal
      record within the city. Ma Xiang! Drive!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The police cars left in a sea of exhaust fumes, leaving as fast as they
      came, taking Yan Xie with them. He was like a whirlwind, arriving without
      warning and sweeping up all clues in his wake before disappearing off into
      the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>Jiang Ting stood rooted to his original spot, his expression solemn.</p>
    <p>
      “Jiang-ge, how did it go?” Yang Mei rushed over quickly, a frantic look
      upon her face. “Did that surnamed Yan guy…”
    </p>
    <p>“He’s starting to suspect us.”</p>
    <p>
      Yang Mei’s heart lurched and she exclaimed in alarm, “Then what should we
      do?!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of the man in the photo surfaced in Jiang Ting’s mind. A long
      period of silence passed. Jiang Ting lifted a hand to straighten the
      collar that was forcefully seized by Yan Xie earlier. Keeping his features
      impassive, he lamented, “What can I do2?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to resist the urge to ask, Ma Xiang spoke up, with one hand on the
      steering wheel, “Yan-ge, do you find that Jiang what’s-his-name
      suspicious?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie had lowered the backrest as low as it could go, his long limbs
      stretched out beneath the dashboard. His eyes were shut as he indulged in
      this brief moment of respite. “Not really.”
    </p>
    <p>“Why?”</p>
    <p>
      “An actual suspect would not be serving clues to us on a silver platter.
      However, he is undeniably strange.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma Xiang did not understand Yan Xie’s words but the latter did not bother
      elaborating. Instead, Yan Xie asked, “You’ve also interacted with him
      twice. Did you feel anything?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking awkward, Ma Xiang replied, “Yan-ge, you know I’m not interested in
      men…”
    </p>
    <p>Yan Xie opened his eyes.</p>
    <p>
      Grinning, Ma Xiang was instantly repentant as he said, “Jokes aside, he
      really did not pique my interest! I wasn’t the one who recorded his
      statement on the night of the crime, and we merely brushed shoulders at
      the shop earlier on. From the look of things, he is rather cooperative and
      quite proactive. Apart from that, he doesn’t seem to have much of a
      presence. If I were to meet him and his girlfriend out on the streets one
      day, I would definitely notice his girlfriend first.”
    </p>
    <p>“Don’t you feel like there’s a sense of incongruity about him?”</p>
    <p>
      “Not at all.” Ma Xiang was baffled. “Which part? He looks pretty decent,
      just a little frail.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie pondered over it a little, then said decidedly, “No. Everything
      fits together too naturally.”
    </p>
    <p>Ma Xiang was more confused than ever.</p>
    <p>
      “Hailing from a county town, doing some hard labour and then being
      bedridden for such a long time, yet he does not shy from his ignorance
      regarding the outside world. He could still retain his composure in the
      face of a group of armed officers.” Yan Xie mulled over this thought for a
      good while. “Why…?”
    </p>
    <p>
      As they neared their destination, Ma Xiang hit the right turn signal to
      enter the parking lot and chuckled, “If you can’t figure it out then don’t
      force it, Yan-ge. It feels like you’re just bashing your head against a
      brick wall. The more fixated you are on it, the more I suspect that the
      one you got your eye on isn’t the lady boss but her boyfriend instead!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What nonsense are you spouting? Would the great me be interested in a
      man?” Yan Xie scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That might have been what he said, but as Yan Xie leaned back into his
      seat, his mind could not help but replay the memory of Jiang Ting sitting
      before him, head raised and hands folded demurely on his lap, the corners
      of his lips raised in a gentle smile.
    </p>
    <p>“It’s just a coincidence.”</p>
    <p>
      “ A few pieces of tinfoil were found lodged in the bottom corner of the
      backpack. They looked a little like chocolate wrappers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He had even specified the nature of the tinfoil, lending emphasis to the
      phrase “chocolate wrappers”. This level of familiarity with mere tinfoils
      gave Yan Xie the impression that Jiang Ting indulged in snacks all day
      long, just like a young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his thoughts in a mess, Yan Xie simply gave up on taking a quick nap.
      Reaching towards the backseat, he picked up the evidence box, then put on
      a pair of gloves and retrieved the black backpack from within. There was
      indeed a small zipper pouch on the front of the bag, and it was from this
      small pouch that the slider had broken off. Yan Xie stuck a hand inside
      and rummaged around. He plucked a few small pieces of tinfoil that were
      half the size of a fingernail from between the seams of the backpack.
    </p>
    <p>
      He casted a thoughtful look over these pieces of tinfoil. There was a
      sliver of doubt within him, telling him that something did not feel right.
    </p>
    <p>
      These few pieces of tinfoil were stiffer than the usual chocolate
      wrappers; the difference was apparent. Instead, it felt more like…
    </p>
    <p>The aluminium foil from blister packs!</p>
    <p>
      The niggling feeling that had haunted him since morning finally
      dissipated, giving way to enlightenment. The vague guesses within his mind
      now solidified into speculations, and he finally had clues to continue the
      investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie made a grab for his phone and punched in a call hurriedly. “Hello,
      son?3? This is Lao Yan!”
    </p>
    <p>“My name is-”</p>
    <p>
      “Listen to me. Is there a type of drug that students usually take before
      sitting for examinations, the kind that accelerates their thought process
      and rapidly increases their IQ to ensure they pass the exam? It would fall
      into the same category of drugs as car sickness medications and ecstasy
      pills, which could suggest that the initial autopsy result was inaccurate
      and thus misled the forensic pathologist into thinking that the cause of
      death was drug overdose?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gou Li replied coldly, “Do you think us forensic specialists stupid? You
      might as well call me a child4!”
    </p>
    <p>“…”</p>
    <p>
      “But the drug you mentioned earlier does exist. It is a prescription drug
      that was recently brought in from overseas, commonly known as the ‘smart
      drug’. The main component of this drug is amphetamine, but has one less
      -methyl group5 attached as compared to crystal meth. It is a central
      nervous system stimulant that is capable of enhancing the brain’s reaction
      speed and heightening its decision-making ability. Reportedly, a lot of
      Ivy League top scorers abroad partake in the consumption of this drug.
      However, excessive usage of this drug can induce hallucinogenic effects,
      symptoms similar to that of the deceased,” Gou Li explained, before asking
      curiously, “What’s up? You suspect that the true cause of death is
      overdose on amphetamine? That is impossible. What we tested was definitely
      a mixture of hyoscine and MDMA, 1600 times more concentrated than the
      normal dosage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What if,” Yan Xie speculated slowly, “What if the deceased didn’t know
      what he was consuming? He only wanted to purchase some amphetamine to
      boost his revision but never suspected that the seller was planning to
      tempt him into doing drugs?”
    </p>
    <p>Gou Li was stunned into silence.</p>
    <p>“This ‘smart drug’ that you were talking about, what is it called?”</p>
    <p>
      “Adderall,” Gou Li answered with a bit of difficulty, “It is pronounced
      the same in Chinese!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go through the files we have on record, focusing on students who are
      well-off and attended prestigious schools, with a history of drug abuse
      and overdose. Limit the time frame to the past two years in this city and
      the past four years in the province.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pull up a list of ex-convicts with criminal records involving the illegal
      purchase of prescription drugs from abroad and only include those who have
      opportunities to contact patients suffering from ADHD, with access to
      large quantities of Adderall. Cross-check this list with the names on the
      drug usage record and review them one by one!”
    </p>
    <p>
      After Yan Xie issued the order, the large office belonging to the Criminal
      Investigation Unit was instantly swamped with a sea of case files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crime solving in real life vastly differed from what was depicted in
      mystery novels. Circumstantial evidence obtained from a crime scene was
      not enough to close a case. The majority of time was spent following up on
      clues and obtaining eyewitness testimonials. The first 48 hours after a
      homicide was also known as the critical hour. If there were no
      breakthroughs within those 48 hours after the crime, then the chances of
      solving the case were greatly decreased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour hand of the large clock hanging on the white wall turned slowly.
      As the sky dimmed, the critical hour passed by in the blink of an eye. The
      steam emitted from cup noodles and the white wisps of cigarette smoke
      mingled in the air to form a misty fog that hung low in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first ray of daylight broke through the next morning, the door to
      the office was pushed open and Qin Chuan rushed in, slamming the case file
      in his hand right onto Yan Xie’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie was sitting upright behind a pile of case files and was thus
      rudely awakened by Qin Chuan’s action. With a cry of surprise, he jolted
      awake and caught the case file that was thrown at him in a fluster. “What?
      What? Did you find it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hu Weisheng.” In a swift motion, Qin Chuan swiped the case file back and
      flipped it open noisily to display a mugshot of a suspect. “Guilty of
      smuggling and producing counterfeit Adderall, Ritalin and Modafinil
      related drugs, earning a profit of more than fifty thousand RMB. He was
      only released from prison half a year ago. Narcotics arrested a
      nineteen-year-old drug addict who was suffering from withdrawal symptoms
      on the street just last month. He was the son of this guy’s landlord!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie pulled out the surveillance photo obtained from the secondhand
      shop and compared it with the mugshot. “Looks similar. Where’s Ma Xiang?
      Head down to the Traffic Security Bureau and investigate the vehicles
      registered under Hu Weisheng’s name!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma Xiang once again demonstrated his wide array of connections. At half
      past four in the morning, the Traffic Management Bureau responded,
      confirming that the suspect Hu Weisheng had a secondhand white Toyota
      Camry registered under his name and the vehicle was a perfect match with
      the one that appeared at the crime scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s him, the bastard.” Yan Xie rapped the tabletop with his knuckles
      sharply, then pointed his finger at a few spirited young officers.
      “Prepare to track down and drag this Hu Weisheng back here!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The two days and two nights of consecutive overtime had left everyone
      feeling suffocated, especially those like Yan Xie and Qin Chuan who were
      the respective leaders of their units. It had already been two nights
      since they last returned home to get a good night’s sleep. Hence, the
      moment Yan Xie issued the arrest order, the whole unit swarmed out of the
      office and half the team was gone in a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie gave Qin Chuan’s shoulder a hearty pat. “It’s been tough on you.
      Our brothers in the Narcotics team also…” He drifted off. The Qin Chuan
      who was still awake 10 seconds ago now had his face plastered against the
      corner of the wall, his glasses askew. It was a completely pure and
      unpretentious posture, and gentle snores whistled through Qin Chuan’s open
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treading with light steps, Yan Xie quietly returned back to his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already five A.M. in the morning, and the sky was beginning to
      lighten up. Deciding to abandon the idea of sleeping, Yan Xie opened Hu
      Weisheng’s case file to peruse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hu Weisheng was a textbook example of the saying, ‘a child who steals a
      needle will grow up to steal gold’. He had gone through repeated arrests
      from the age of sixteen for petty theft. After he came of age, he moved on
      to stealing purses, mobile phones and electric bicycles, and was
      imprisoned a couple of times as a result. A few years ago, he was involved
      in a more serious case in Gongzhou and was sentenced to 3 years for
      attempted rape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie ran a hand over the stubbles on his chin, then gave a low cry of
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hu Weisheng was a street thief, and his targets were always personal
      belongings. He had no records of breaking and entering. Judging from this
      point alone, he was probably a coward, and the nature of his crimes was
      inherently different from the rape that he was convicted of. This act of
      his that “crossed boundaries” was very suspicious indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Staring at the word ‘Gongzhou’ in the case file, something stirred within
      the depths of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yan-ge.” Suddenly, Ma Xiang poked his head in. “That top chemistry
      student has been detained in the bureau for almost 24 hours. Should we
      release him?”
    </p>
    <p>Yan Xie raised his head in surprise. “What? He’s still here?”</p>
    <p>
      “The forensic team failed to recover any footage from the lab, so we are
      still keeping him detained momentarily. He spent the night sleeping in the
      interrogation room and woke up with a cold this morning, coughing his
      lungs out and hugging onto a tissue box for dear life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurry up and release him, lest he files a complaint against us. By the
      way, instruct him not to leave Jianning during this period and to be in
      constant contact with the police. Remind him to pay attention to the
      legislation involved.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma Xiang flashed an ‘OK’ sign at Yan Xie and said, “No problem. The top
      student had already said he won’t file a complaint, we just need to hurry
      up and send him back to the lab.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie gave a wave and gestured at Ma Xiang to make a move and close the
      door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a soft click, the office resumed its previous state of stillness at
      the break of dawn. For a while, the only sign of life in the room was the
      blinking yellow light at the bottom right corner of the monitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie tapped out an absent-minded rhythm on the tabletop with his middle
      finger. There was a strange, unsettling feeling in his heart that he was
      unable to shake off as he stewed in silence, deep in thought.
    </p>
    <p>Everything was going too smoothly, he thought to himself.</p>
    <p>
      From the start of the investigation to identifying the car plate number,
      to finding the deceased’s backpack, and then to narrowing down the
      investigation scope to a single suspect based on a deduction that stemmed
      from a very weak logical chain. Two days and three nights had already
      passed, but the investigation was progressing with such ease that it felt
      like there were some underlying details that they had missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why would an experienced drug dealer who had been selling a novel mix of
      prescription drugs and hallucinogens for a long time suddenly cause a
      death this time around?
    </p>
    <p>How could it be that no accidents had occurred until now?</p>
    <p>
      Was there an error in the formula, or was it that the previous ‘accidents’
      were all inexplicably explained away by various excuses, and it was only
      by chance that the victim had died right before his eyes this time, making
      it impossible for the incident to be suppressed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Switching on the computer, Yan Xie accessed the public security internal
      network. After much deliberation, he entered a string of passwords and
      pulled up the electronic backups of the case files from past years. Then,
      he entered the case file number corresponding to Hu Weisheng’s arrest in
      Gongzhou.
    </p>
    <p>
      The screen transitioned abruptly, bringing to light the case that was
      gathering dust in the recesses of the database. Under the soft morning
      rays of the autumn sunlight, the case details took shape right before Yan
      Xie’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liu Xue, eighteen years old, was a student from a renowned high school in
      Gongzhou.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day before the start of the second mock exam, this third year student
      took advantage of the noon break to sneak out of the school dormitories
      and disappeared for the entire afternoon. That night, the school launched
      a search effort that lasted the entire night but to no avail. Her parents
      lodged a police report the following day. In less than a day, this missing
      persons case attracted the full attention of the local police station and
      was soon transferred over to the district bureau.
    </p>
    <p>The district bureau accepted the case.</p>
    <p>
      The following night, based on a series of investigations, the police found
      an unconscious Liu Xue in an unlicensed clinic.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the subsequent investigation, the suspect Hu Weisheng chanced
      upon Liu Xue when the latter was loitering around on the streets due to
      exam stress. This aroused his evil intent and he immediately lured her
      into the car and drugged her. Unexpectedly, Liu Xue was allergic to the
      drug he administered and she immediately developed a series of symptoms
      such as dizziness and vomiting. She eventually fainted. Hu Weisheng was
      afraid that he would be implicated if an accidental death were to occur,
      so he briskly left her at an unlicensed clinic and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nature of this case was ruled as attempted rape. After Liu Xue was
      discharged from the hospital post-treatment, Hu Weisheng was sentenced to
      three years imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Staring at the case file, Yan Xie could not believe his eyes—it was simply
      ruled as such?
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the real cause of the victim’s allergic reaction? What was the
      drug administered? Were there no other reasons for a man to drug a woman
      other than rape? If he really harbored the intention to rape her, then why
      did the rapist panic after she lost consciousness and send her straight to
      a clinic?
    </p>
    <p>
      It had only been less than a month since the case was filed before it was
      referred to the district bureau. There was obviously more to the case than
      meets the eye but the case was inexplicably resolved with such haste. Did
      none of the investigators involved in this case raise their suspicions
      regarding this unusual matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie’s instinct, honed by all the cases he had handled over the past
      decade, led him to possess an extremely keen sense for details. The more
      he thought about this case, the more dubious it seemed. Finally, he gave
      in to the urge and scrolled to the last page for the list of officers
      involved in the case as well as their lead investigator’s name—
    </p>
    <p>His gaze stalled as he froze in place.</p>
    <p>The lead investigator of this case then was called Jiang Ting.</p>
    <p>
      From the depths of his memories, a large shadow surfaced. In that split
      second, the silhouette who repeatedly appeared in Yan Xie’s dreams turned
      around to face him quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the only time the figure did not focus on the mobile phone, nor
      did he skimp on the amount of attention he paid Yan Xie. Daylight streamed
      in through the window, tracing the contours of his striking physique,
      highlighting the handsome planes of his visage, as well as the curve of
      his thin lips that carried a hint of coldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness, his half-lidded gaze was directed at Yan Xie, clear and
      unwavering.
    </p>
    <p>“…”</p>
    <p>
      It felt like there was an intangible hand seizing Yan Xie by the throat,
      trapping his breath in his chest with nowhere to escape, causing his own
      hands to tremble. Before he could get ahold of his senses, he had already
      entered the internal network database and retrieved the list of key
      leaders of Gongzhou City’s Public Security Bureau from that year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gongzhou Narcotics Unit Second Team Captain Jiang Ting. His name was
      encased in a conspicuous black frame. He was confirmed to have sacrificed
      himself in the line of duty 3 years ago.
    </p>
    <p>A large explosion went off in Yan Xie’s mind.</p>
    <p>
      The man who sat on the bench and smiled at him by the roadside yesterday.
      The same man who was currently staring coldly at him through the computer
      screen, clad in a navy blue uniform, with three four-pointed stars
      studding his shoulders, his distinctive features displayed in full view.
    </p>
    <h2>Chapter 8</h2>

    <p>
      With a loud ‘Fuck!’, Wei Yao stormed out of his office and charged down
      the stairs two steps at a time as he made a beeline for the Vice-Captain’s
      office. Directly barging in, he yelled, “Yan Xie!”
    </p>

    <p>The man himself was seated behind his computer.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      “You used my password to access the internal network again! Don’t you know
      that’s a severe breach of protocol?!”
    </p>

    <p>
      Frozen in place, Yan Xie slowly lifted his head. When Wei Yao saw how he
      was acting, his rage bubbled to the surface. “Your Captain Zhu has only
      been hospitalized for a few days and yet you’re already in a rush to
      celebrate! Did you really believe I didn’t know you brought the whole unit
      out for drinks and karaoke a few nights ago? When I called you, all I
      heard from your background noise was ‘to love each other every day as if
      it’s our last day on earth’ what’s there to love amongst a group of grown
      men such as yourself!”
    </p>

    <p>
      Yan Xie parted his lips to say something, but was cut off by an irate Wei
      Yao, upset that Yan Xie had somehow failed to live up to his expectations.
      “Brat, you can kiss your promotion goodbye at this rate! Look at what
      you’re wearing! That watch! Those shoes! That hair! Are you here to work
      or to catwalk? With the number of times the disciplinary team have issued
      you warning letters, can you at least remember the appropriate dress code
      by now?!”
    </p>

    <p>“Deputy Wei…”</p>

    <p>
      “Log out of the account immediately! Hurry up before someone notices!”
    </p>

    <p>
      With his hands on his waist, Wei Yao panted for breath. He still wanted to
      take this opportunity to continue his tirade when Yan Xie suddenly asked,
      “How did Jiang Ting die?”
    </p>

    <p>Wei Yao was taken by surprise. “What?”</p>

    <p>
      “Gongzhou Narcotics Unit Second Team Captain Jiang Ting was confirmed to
      have sacrificed his life in the line of duty 3 years ago. How exactly did
      he die?”
    </p>

    <p>
      Wei Yao remained stunned for a few moments before he finally showed a
      visible reaction to Yan Xie’s question. When he did, he was caught between
      exasperation and frustration. “It has already been a few years, yet you
      still cannot move past what happened that year with Gongzhou City’s Public
      Security Bureau? Yes, they had almost given away the credit for your
      labour to someone else, but didn’t they decide not to in the end? You
      still-”
    </p>

    <p>“Is Jiang Ting really dead?”</p>

    <p>
      Wei Yao groaned and retorted, “Are you still not done with that? Is this
      even related to the 502 Frozen Corpse case that you’re investigating right
      now”
    </p>

    <p>“Yes,” Yan Xie replied.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      “Yes, my ass! Don’t use my password to randomly access the internal
      network just because you’re idle!”
    </p>

    <p>
      “There is a connection,” Yan Xie repeated firmly. He raised a hand and
      pushed the case file on the table towards Wei Yao. “Hu Weisheng. He is
      from Gongzhou, and was sentenced to prison for buying, selling and
      counterfeiting prescription drugs from abroad. He’s also suspected of
      using counterfeit Adderall to entice minors and hook them onto drugs. A
      few years ago in Gongzhou, he was charged with attempted rape because he
      drugged a high school female student. I suspect that there is more to this
      case than meets the eye. He probably didn’t roofie her; the drug he used
      was most likely an addictive hallucinogen, something similar to Adderall.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “The lead investigator of this case back then was Jiang Ting,” Yan Xie
      said, leveling a stubborn gaze at Wei Yao. “Three years ago, there was a
      chain of explosions at the crime scene of the drug enforcement case under
      Jiang Ting’s command. More than a dozen police officers from the Narcotics
      Unit lost their lives, and Jiang Ting’s body was blown to smithereens,
      unable to be retrieved. What exactly happened then?”
    </p>

    <p>
      Under Yan Xie’s firm and unwavering tone, Wei Yao’s fury slowly dissipated
      and he began to seriously contemplate Yan Xie’s words. After a while, he
      pulled up a chair and sat down across from Yan Xie.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      Exhaling heavily, Wei Yao said, “The total amount of drugs seized during
      that anti-drug operation weighed over 80 kilograms.”
    </p>

    <p>Yan Xie’s pupils constricted in shock. <em>That was huge!</em></p>

    <p>
      However, Wei Yao’s following sentence was a splash of ice cold water on
      his heart. “Afterwards, everyone said that it was the payment for all the
      lives lost during the operation.”
    </p>

    <p>“…What does that mean?”</p>

    <p>
      “There was an extensive amount of drugs involved in that case. The volume
      of business transactions and money invested by the drug traffickers were
      of significant amounts as well. Their business methods typically revolved
      around three things: people, money, and goods. The team had received a tip
      off from the mole they planted in the syndicate and narrowed the dealing
      locations down to two. One was a plastic factory on the outskirts of the
      city, and the other was the eco-park. It was finally deduced that the
      dealing location was the plastic factory, while the drugs and illegal
      firearms were buried under the plantations in the eco-park.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “According to the original plan, Jiang Ting was supposed to bring enough
      firepower and a squad of Special Operation Forces officers to storm the
      plantation, while another group of officers was to set up an ambush at the
      plastic factory. However, before the operation commenced, Jiang Ting, who
      was the lead strategist, secretly redirected the elite team heading
      towards the eco-park towards the plastic factory. Furthermore, they had
      rushed in without sufficient preparation. Barely half an hour later, a
      chain of explosions ripped through the entire plastic manufacturing
      plant.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “The drug traffickers and their buyers were already gone before the police
      arrived, and the bombs were rigged beforehand,” Wei Yao intoned solemnly.
      “Jiang Ting’s inexplicable sudden change of plans was akin to personally
      sending his comrades into hell.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Bewildered, Yan Xie asked, “Why did they run? Was the information leaked?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “After the incident, a lot of people were suspicious about that, to the
      extent that some believed Jiang Ting’s change of plans was an act of
      collusion between him and the drug traffickers. But this suspicion was
      hard to prove because Jiang Ting himself had died and the fire spread very
      quickly as well. The corpse couldn’t even be retrieved in the end.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Having said all that, Wei Yao paused, then asked curiously, “Why? Do you
      suspect that he didn’t die?”
    </p>

    <p>
      Yan Xie slowly leaned back into his seat, a distant look in his eyes. A
      few seconds later, he cleared his throat and gave a light cough. “Of
      course not.”
    </p>

    <p>
      There seemed to be something on the tip of Wei Yao’s tongue but he
      resisted the urge and swallowed the words back down, directing a probing
      gaze at Yan Xie instead. “Then why did you ask me earlier on if he really
      died?”
    </p>

    <p>
      “…I was just curious why he wasn’t commended as a martyr posthumously.
      Earlier on, I noticed that the others from Gongzhou’s Narcotics Unit
      Second Team who sacrificed their lives were all commended. Even if it was
      a severe misjudgement on his end, the fact remains that he was sacrificed
      in the line of duty. It couldn’t be to the extent where they weren’t even
      willing to give him an award.”
    </p>

    <p>
      This was just a series of passing remarks made by Yan Xie, but Wei Yao’s
      expression suddenly turned complicated. He deliberated for a moment, then
      said, “It’s because of that undercover agent.”
    </p>

    <p>Yan Xie made a querying noise.</p>

    <p>
      “After the explosion, Gongzhou’s Public Security Unit<sup
        ><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup
      >
      set up a special investigations team. After a thorough investigation of
      the operations and events of that night, they discovered one
      thing—remember the mole I mentioned who provided them with the two
      locations?”
    </p>

    <p>Unconsciously, Yan Xie’s brows were beginning to furrow.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      “This undercover agent was codenamed ‘Rivet’, and it had already been a
      few years since his infiltration. Although he did not manage to climb up
      the ranks to be by the leader’s side, codenamed ‘Big K’, he was once close
      to the second-in-command. As a result, he used to provide a lot of
      valuable leads and had been Gongzhou’s Narcotics Unit’s most valuable
      source of information.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “After the explosions at the plastics plant, it was suspected that there
      was a leak within the police force. Rivet was also at risk of being
      exposed, hence the special investigations team made the urgent decision to
      put together a small task force to extricate him. However, by the time
      they figured out his location and rushed over, it was already too late.
      Rivet had been killed by the drug traffickers, his corpse burnt to ashes.
      The rescue operation was a failure.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Wei Yao gave a long sigh, and Yan Xie’s expression grew heavier.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      “After Rivet’s death, the special investigations team retrieved the
      computer he had used before and found out that he had forwarded an
      encrypted email to the police containing details of the drug syndicate.
      When decrypted, a portion of the syndicate’s trading chart was revealed,
      detailing all the hidden drugs and firearms in the eco-park’s plantation.
      That is to say, as the lead investigator of the case, it was impossible
      that Jiang Ting did not see the email beforehand. Therefore, his act of
      pulling the elite team from their original assignment and moving them to
      the plastic factory that resulted in the deaths of more than ten agents
      became extremely suspicious.”
    </p>

    <p>
      “There’s a high chance he did it intentionally,” muttered Yan Xie in a
      barely audible tone.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Yes,” Wei Yao said gravely, “the syndicate’s own mole within the police
      force could also have been Jiang Ting himself.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Yan Xie lapsed into silence. The atmosphere between them suddenly turned
      coarse, as though there were a million small blades in the air, lightly
      scraping across his face from time to time.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      The two of them sat across from each other for a long while before Yan Xie
      intoned in a low voice, “Back then, after that case which we cooperated
      with Gongzhou on concluded and the report was made, someone came to find
      me for a talk. Their request was for me to voluntarily hand the credit to
      a ‘well-connected individual’ in Gongzhou. I was young and brash, full of
      vigor, so I refused. In the end, I was lectured in turn by various people
      for half a month. It felt like the whole world was against me. Everyday,
      resentment brewed in my chest, and I was overwhelmed with the urge to
      destroy that entire City Bureau to bits.”
    </p>

    <p>Deputy Commissioner Wei covered his cough with a hand over his mouth.</p>

    <p>
      “I pulled a long face everywhere and behaved unreasonably. This continued
      until two days before the award ceremony, when suddenly Gongzhou sent word
      that their Commander-in-Chief had eventually signed the report and
      accredited the case to me, and even gave me a second-class merit.” Yan Xie
      let out a soft exhale. “The Commander-in-Chief during the operation then
      was Jiang Ting.”
    </p>

    <p>
      As the elder between the two, Wei Yao had a more pertinent way of looking
      at the matter. “People are multifaceted. It’s good that you harbour
      gratitude towards him, but anything that happens after should be viewed as
      separate issues.”
    </p>

    <p>“No, it’s not gratitude,” Yan Xie said resolutely. “None at all.”</p>

    <p>Wei Yao was confused.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      However, Yan Xie did not deign to elaborate on his thoughts. Instead, he
      murmured, “I just can’t figure Jiang Ting out.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Patting his shoulder, Wei Yao responded, “The man is already dead.
      Although there was no final judgement passed, thinking about it more will
      get you nowhere. Keep everything that I told you today to yourself . After
      all, it’s an unsolved case in Gongzhou and people are still sensitive
      about it. It won’t do you any good if word spreads.”
    </p>

    <p>Yan Xie was silent.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      The phone on the desk began to ring. “Vice-Captain Yan! We’ve arrested
      that bastard Hu Weisheng and we’re almost at the bureau!”
    </p>

    <p>
      “Go ahead and work on your tasks.” Wei Yao straightened from his seat.
      “Any drug-related case will not be a small matter. We must get to the root
      of the source, trace through the downlines and the entire network, as well
      as capture the suspect and all their associates in one fell swoop. If you
      can uncover the truth behind the attempted rape case in Gongzhou, you must
      grab hold of the chance, understand?”
    </p>

    <p>“Understood,” Yan Xie affirmed.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>
      Yan Xie personally sent Deputy Commissioner Wei out of his office. He
      stood at the exit of the stairwell, watching as Wei Yao entered the
      elevator. Not long after, a clamouring emerged from the lower level as the
      sounds of cars, footsteps and conversations neared. The officers who had
      picked up the suspect from his den at first light had returned.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <p>
      “Yan-<em>ge</em>!” Ma Xiang poked his head out from the end of the
      corridor, pursing his lips in the direction of the interrogation room.
      “Let’s go together?”
    </p>

    <p>Yan Xie raised his hand and beckoned to Ma Xiang.</p>

    <p>
      Bemused, Ma Xiang jogged over, only to hear Yan Xie whisper beside his
      ear, “Call Vice-Captain Qin from the room over and interrogate Hu
      Weisheng, together with <em>Lao </em>Song and <em>Lao </em>Zhao. I’ll head
      out for a bit, but don’t tell anyone.”
    </p>

    <p>“You’re heading to…”</p>

    <p>
      Yan Xie gave his back a light pat. “Call me if you need me,” he said over
      his shoulder, making his way down the flight of stairs. After heading down
      a couple of steps, he <span title="突然" class="word">abruptly</span> came
      to a stop as he seemed to recall something.
    </p>

    <p
      title="他转身，回到了自己的办公室。 当他从抽屉里抓起一把很久没用过的车钥匙，正要站起来的时候，无意中瞥见了自己的显示器界面，顿时愣住了。"
