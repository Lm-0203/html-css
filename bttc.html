    <p>
      Autumn Rain Branded Goods. Buy and Sell Second-hand Bags, Jewellery and
      Luxury Goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie got out of the police car and slowly crossed his arms as he eyed
      the shop sign before his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma Xiang went up to greet him, “Yan-ge, the one who reported the case is
      over there, we just-”
    </p>
    <p>Yan Xie interrupted Ma Xiang with a wave of his hand.</p>
    <p>
      “Inform the field teams that the search for second-hand shops is over,” he
      instructed. “The backpack in question has been found.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A few police officers were locking down the shop entrance. The dumbfounded
      shopkeeper was exchanging words with an officer in agitation. The
      forensics team had placed the conspicuous black and yellow backpack into
      an evidence bag and was just starting to lift fingerprints for comparison.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sidewalk outside the store, a police officer was recording a
      statement from Jiang Ting, who was seated on a bench. He was leaning back
      comfortably, with his head slightly raised and his long and slender legs
      slightly parted. He looked as though he was lounging on a genuine leather
      sofa at home, so much that he showed no inclination to rise even when Yan
      Xie walked over.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A friend of mine wanted to get rid of her unused handbag, so I came out
      to have a look around with her and chanced upon that backpack on the sales
      counter. It struck me that it could be related to the case two days ago-”
    </p>
    <p>
      “The shop owner told me that you rummaged through the bag before calling
      the police. What was that about?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I only wanted to see what it contained.” Jiang Ting’s voice faltered a
      bit. “A few small pieces of tin foil were found lodged in the front
      pockets of the bag. They looked a bit like chocolate wrappers. Maybe you
      should get forensics to give it a lookover.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As a police officer, he was used to members of the public making arbitrary
      comments and suggestions over the course of the investigation so he merely
      gave a non-committal grunt in response to Jiang Ting’s words.
      Unexpectedly, someone patted him on the shoulder. “Hey, Vice-Captain Yan!”
    </p>
    <p>Yan Xie gestured with his hand and said, “Leave this to me.”</p>
    <p>
      The officer let out a surprised “oh” and handed over the statement records
      to him before heading off to assist the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, Yan Xie showed no interest towards the records he held in his
      hands. Crossing his arms, he stood before Jiang Ting and stared at the
      latter unblinkingly, not uttering a single word.
    </p>
    <p>“Hello, Officer Yan,” Jiang Ting greeted politely.</p>
    <p>
      “The police bureau has yet to offer rewards, yet you’re providing us with
      leads this early. What a shame.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jiang Ting’s lips curved. “What do you mean? I was only accompanying Yang
      Mei on her errands and coincidentally saw the bag. I’m just an eyewitness
      doing my civic duty by lending aid to the investigation, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
      The two of them looked at each other, one standing and the other one
      sitting. The tranquility on the surface could not mask the strange
      undercurrent of danger that lurked in the air.
    </p>
    <p>“You did it on purpose.”</p>
    <p>“What?”</p>
    <p>
      “You wished to know why I revisited the crime scene and was curious about
      what I found by the roadside. There are two second-hand shops in closer
      proximity to Sleepless Palace KTV, and yet this is the one you found.” Yan
      Xie narrowed his eyes as he made no attempt to mask his scrutiny of the
      other man. “You seem to be unusually invested in this case. Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Maintaining his genial expression, Jiang Ting replied, “You’re
      overthinking it, Officer. This shop offers better prices as compared to
      the others.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A forensics officer hurried over to the pair. “Vice-Captain Yan, the
      results are out! The preliminary comparison between the prints found on
      the backpack match those of the deceased’s! We will be bringing the
      evidence back to the bureau to run a comprehensive analysis. One more
      thing—according to the shopkeeper, this bag was brought over and sold at a
      low price by a man on the 3rd of May, at around eight in the morning. He
      was holding a Toyota car key. We are attempting to contact the Traffic
      Police Brigade to obtain the surveillance for this road’s license plate
      records.”
    </p>
    <p>“What about the store’s surveillance videos?”</p>
    <p>“We’re working on it. It should be done soon.”</p>
    <p>Yan Xie was silent.</p>
    <p>
      “There’s just this one issue, Vice-Captain Yan,” the officer voiced
      hesitantly, “Eight A.M. coincides with the morning rush hour and a lot of
      cars pass by this road. It will be difficult to pinpoint the target. If we
      review the vehicles one by one, it’s going to take an indefinite amount of
      time. What should we do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Even as Yan Xie listened to the report, his gaze was focused intently upon
      Jiang Ting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jiang Ting folded his hands on his lap and returned Yan Xie’s gaze
      quietly.
    </p>
    <p>“Ma Xiang,” Yan Xie called.</p>
    <p>Ma Xiang materialized before him. “Here!”</p>
    <p>
      “The street surveillance footage I requested previously, was there a
      Toyota among the seven cars singled out?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Momentarily taken aback, Ma Xiang quickly recovered and exclaimed, “Yes!
      There was one!” He reported the license plate number immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping his eyes glued on Jiang Ting, Yan Xie tilted his head towards the
      forensics officer. “Use that as a reference when reviewing the new
      surveillance footage from this street. If you find a match, head down to
      the Traffic Security Bureau to investigate the car owner.”
    </p>
    <p>The forensic officer heaved a sigh of relief. “Yes Sir!”</p>
    <p>
      Both the officer and Ma Xiang left swiftly, leaving both Jiang Ting and
      Yan Xie alone by the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few metres away, Yang Mei finally found a moment of reprieve amidst all
      the statements she had to provide to the interrogation officer. She was
      about to make her way towards them before she was halted again. Yang Mei
      was unable to mask the anxious glance she directed towards Jiang Ting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie mused, “That girlfriend of yours seems to be especially scared of
      leaving you alone. Does she think I’m going to gobble you up?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jiang Ting dryly replied, “If Officer Yan were to have a half-crippled
      girlfriend with nothing to her name, maybe you’d empathise.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have nothing to your name?” Yan Xie retorted immediately. “Can a
      person with nothing to their name stay one step ahead of the police?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I can’t help that it’s a coincidence,” Jiang Ting replied, a trace of
      helplessness colouring his tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jiang Ting’s attitude and responses towards the police already went beyond
      mere cooperation; one could even describe it as harmonious. However, Yan
      Xie’s angled features were inscrutable; there could even be a hint of
      hostility in his stern expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next few seconds passed in silence, their gazes locked onto each
      other. It was Yan Xie who broke the silence first.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Feng Yuguang was a post-graduate student from a renowned university who
      came to Jianning for an internship in preparation for his doctorate exam.
      His death was caused by the combined effects of hyoscine and MDMA, as well
      as other addictive drugs.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jiang Ting let out a low whistle. “I see. No wonder he ran into the
      freezer.”
    </p>
    <p>“So, do you have any insights to offer, Mr. Lu?”</p>
    <p>
      Jiang Ting looked at Yan Xie questioningly, a look of perfectly feigned
      astonishment upon his face. “None. This question of yours seems a little…”
    </p>
    <p>“Then what’s with the ‘I see’?”</p>
    <p>“…”</p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie remarked coldly, “I only mentioned addictive drugs, yet you
      managed to infer their hallucinogenic nature from what I said. An average
      person wouldn’t even know what hyoscine and MDMA are. Or are you trying to
      say that you majored in pharmaceutical science back in university?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, a tiny crack appeared in Jiang Ting’s usual calm and composed
      demeanor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the change in his expression only lasted for a millisecond. Following
      that, he revealed a more subdued expression, as though he was caught
      between laughter and tears, and said, “Officer Yan, even though I’ve never
      attended university, anyone who is familiar with motion sickness
      medication would know what hyoscine is. You should know that
      dimenhydrinate1 isn’t the only drug in the world.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Opening his mouth, Yan Xie appeared to have another retort ready on the
      tip of his tongue, but Jiang Ting interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know how I offended you to arouse your suspicions so, but since
      you’re so close to uncovering the murderer, then there’s no need to harass
      such a law-abiding citizen like me anymore, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Didn’t you mention previously that you wanted to break up with your
      girlfriend and return to your hometown?”
    </p>
    <p>“…”</p>
    <p>“Wait here,” Yan Xie commanded.</p>
    <p>
      He turned on his heel and walked away just as a forensic image analyst
      happened to emerge from the backend of the second-hand store. The forensic
      image analyst waved Yan Xie over instantly. “Vice-Captain Yan, we found
      it! A white Toyota Camry passed by the crime scene on the day Case 502
      happened and only left this street at half-past-8 the next morning. This
      is the surveillance footage from the store!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie could feel Jiang Ting’s unfathomable gaze boring into the back of
      his neck, but he paid it no mind as he made his way over to where the
      forensic image analyst was to take a look at the coloured photo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the shot taken by the shop’s surveillance camera, a slightly chubby
      man of average height who looked to be in his forties was holding on to
      the Fendi backpack and standing in front of the counter, in the midst of a
      negotiation with the shopkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Has there been any news from the Traffic Security Bureau? What’s the name
      of this bastard?”
    </p>
    <p>“They can’t identify him…”</p>
    <p>Yan Xie frowned.</p>
    <p>
      The forensic image analyst carefully explained, “He was driving a car…
      with a fake license plate.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth was almost within reach, yet the trail once again snapped with a
      crack.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not utter a single word, but his jaw muscles visibly tightened and
      the lines of his shoulders were stretched taut beneath his shirt, like a
      drawn bowstring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody dared to speak for a long time until the sound of footsteps came to
      a stop behind Yan Xie. It was followed up by Jiang Ting’s amiable tone of
      voice as he asked, “Officer Yan, if there’s nothing else, may I take my
      leave?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie’s arm shot out and—under the startled gaze of the forensic
      analyst—grabbed hold of Jiang Ting’s shoulders, tugging him into his
      embrace before the latter had a chance to react. Waving the photo he had
      just obtained in Jiang Ting’s face, Yan Xie asked, “Recognise him?”
    </p>
    <p>
      In the few seconds that passed after, Jiang Ting could feel Yan Xie’s
      fiery glare scorching a trail down his skin. Dropping his gaze, Jiang Ting
      casted a cursory glance over the photo presented to him before turning an
      aggrieved look towards Yan Xie.
    </p>
    <p>
      “How am I supposed to recognise him? Don’t the police usually investigate
      vehicles with past records in the system first before moving on to the
      criminals? I can’t even be considered an eyewitness to the crime.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie finally released Jiang Ting and gave his shoulder an energetic
      pat. “You’re not allowed to leave.”
    </p>
    <p>Another questioning look was thrown in his direction.</p>
    <p>
      “You’re considered a person of interest and hence forbidden to leave the
      state. You must remain in Jianning until the case is resolved.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jiang Ting’s expression stiffened. Contrarily, Yan Xie turned around with
      a skip in his step. With the air of a general who had just achieved a
      great victory, Yan Xie walked towards the police car with large strides.
      Waving the photo in his hand, he raised his voice and called out, “Let’s
      wrap it up and head back to the bureau! The forensics team are to return
      to the lab to continue investigating the evidence and conduct a thorough
      inspection of suspicious vehicles and anyone with a previous criminal
      record within the city. Ma Xiang! Drive!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The police cars left in a sea of exhaust fumes, leaving as fast as they
      came, taking Yan Xie with them. He was like a whirlwind, arriving without
      warning and sweeping up all clues in his wake before disappearing off into
      the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>Jiang Ting stood rooted to his original spot, his expression solemn.</p>
    <p>
      “Jiang-ge, how did it go?” Yang Mei rushed over quickly, a frantic look
      upon her face. “Did that surnamed Yan guy…”
    </p>
    <p>“He’s starting to suspect us.”</p>
    <p>
      Yang Mei’s heart lurched and she exclaimed in alarm, “Then what should we
      do?!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of the man in the photo surfaced in Jiang Ting’s mind. A long
      period of silence passed. Jiang Ting lifted a hand to straighten the
      collar that was forcefully seized by Yan Xie earlier. Keeping his features
      impassive, he lamented, “What can I do2?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to resist the urge to ask, Ma Xiang spoke up, with one hand on the
      steering wheel, “Yan-ge, do you find that Jiang what’s-his-name
      suspicious?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie had lowered the backrest as low as it could go, his long limbs
      stretched out beneath the dashboard. His eyes were shut as he indulged in
      this brief moment of respite. “Not really.”
    </p>
    <p>“Why?”</p>
    <p>
      “An actual suspect would not be serving clues to us on a silver platter.
      However, he is undeniably strange.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma Xiang did not understand Yan Xie’s words but the latter did not bother
      elaborating. Instead, Yan Xie asked, “You’ve also interacted with him
      twice. Did you feel anything?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking awkward, Ma Xiang replied, “Yan-ge, you know I’m not interested in
      men…”
    </p>
    <p>Yan Xie opened his eyes.</p>
    <p>
      Grinning, Ma Xiang was instantly repentant as he said, “Jokes aside, he
      really did not pique my interest! I wasn’t the one who recorded his
      statement on the night of the crime, and we merely brushed shoulders at
      the shop earlier on. From the look of things, he is rather cooperative and
      quite proactive. Apart from that, he doesn’t seem to have much of a
      presence. If I were to meet him and his girlfriend out on the streets one
      day, I would definitely notice his girlfriend first.”
    </p>
    <p>“Don’t you feel like there’s a sense of incongruity about him?”</p>
    <p>
      “Not at all.” Ma Xiang was baffled. “Which part? He looks pretty decent,
      just a little frail.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie pondered over it a little, then said decidedly, “No. Everything
      fits together too naturally.”
    </p>
    <p>Ma Xiang was more confused than ever.</p>
    <p>
      “Hailing from a county town, doing some hard labour and then being
      bedridden for such a long time, yet he does not shy from his ignorance
      regarding the outside world. He could still retain his composure in the
      face of a group of armed officers.” Yan Xie mulled over this thought for a
      good while. “Why…?”
    </p>
    <p>
      As they neared their destination, Ma Xiang hit the right turn signal to
      enter the parking lot and chuckled, “If you can’t figure it out then don’t
      force it, Yan-ge. It feels like you’re just bashing your head against a
      brick wall. The more fixated you are on it, the more I suspect that the
      one you got your eye on isn’t the lady boss but her boyfriend instead!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What nonsense are you spouting? Would the great me be interested in a
      man?” Yan Xie scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That might have been what he said, but as Yan Xie leaned back into his
      seat, his mind could not help but replay the memory of Jiang Ting sitting
      before him, head raised and hands folded demurely on his lap, the corners
      of his lips raised in a gentle smile.
    </p>
    <p>“It’s just a coincidence.”</p>
    <p>
      “ A few pieces of tinfoil were found lodged in the bottom corner of the
      backpack. They looked a little like chocolate wrappers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He had even specified the nature of the tinfoil, lending emphasis to the
      phrase “chocolate wrappers”. This level of familiarity with mere tinfoils
      gave Yan Xie the impression that Jiang Ting indulged in snacks all day
      long, just like a young girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      With his thoughts in a mess, Yan Xie simply gave up on taking a quick nap.
      Reaching towards the backseat, he picked up the evidence box, then put on
      a pair of gloves and retrieved the black backpack from within. There was
      indeed a small zipper pouch on the front of the bag, and it was from this
      small pouch that the slider had broken off. Yan Xie stuck a hand inside
      and rummaged around. He plucked a few small pieces of tinfoil that were
      half the size of a fingernail from between the seams of the backpack.
    </p>
    <p>
      He casted a thoughtful look over these pieces of tinfoil. There was a
      sliver of doubt within him, telling him that something did not feel right.
    </p>
    <p>
      These few pieces of tinfoil were stiffer than the usual chocolate
      wrappers; the difference was apparent. Instead, it felt more like…
    </p>
    <p>The aluminium foil from blister packs!</p>
    <p>
      The niggling feeling that had haunted him since morning finally
      dissipated, giving way to enlightenment. The vague guesses within his mind
      now solidified into speculations, and he finally had clues to continue the
      investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie made a grab for his phone and punched in a call hurriedly. “Hello,
      son?3? This is Lao Yan!”
    </p>
    <p>“My name is-”</p>
    <p>
      “Listen to me. Is there a type of drug that students usually take before
      sitting for examinations, the kind that accelerates their thought process
      and rapidly increases their IQ to ensure they pass the exam? It would fall
      into the same category of drugs as car sickness medications and ecstasy
      pills, which could suggest that the initial autopsy result was inaccurate
      and thus misled the forensic pathologist into thinking that the cause of
      death was drug overdose?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gou Li replied coldly, “Do you think us forensic specialists stupid? You
      might as well call me a child4!”
    </p>
    <p>“…”</p>
    <p>
      “But the drug you mentioned earlier does exist. It is a prescription drug
      that was recently brought in from overseas, commonly known as the ‘smart
      drug’. The main component of this drug is amphetamine, but has one less
      -methyl group5 attached as compared to crystal meth. It is a central
      nervous system stimulant that is capable of enhancing the brain’s reaction
      speed and heightening its decision-making ability. Reportedly, a lot of
      Ivy League top scorers abroad partake in the consumption of this drug.
      However, excessive usage of this drug can induce hallucinogenic effects,
      symptoms similar to that of the deceased,” Gou Li explained, before asking
      curiously, “What’s up? You suspect that the true cause of death is
      overdose on amphetamine? That is impossible. What we tested was definitely
      a mixture of hyoscine and MDMA, 1600 times more concentrated than the
      normal dosage.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What if,” Yan Xie speculated slowly, “What if the deceased didn’t know
      what he was consuming? He only wanted to purchase some amphetamine to
      boost his revision but never suspected that the seller was planning to
      tempt him into doing drugs?”
    </p>
    <p>Gou Li was stunned into silence.</p>
    <p>“This ‘smart drug’ that you were talking about, what is it called?”</p>
    <p>
      “Adderall,” Gou Li answered with a bit of difficulty, “It is pronounced
      the same in Chinese!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go through the files we have on record, focusing on students who are
      well-off and attended prestigious schools, with a history of drug abuse
      and overdose. Limit the time frame to the past two years in this city and
      the past four years in the province.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pull up a list of ex-convicts with criminal records involving the illegal
      purchase of prescription drugs from abroad and only include those who have
      opportunities to contact patients suffering from ADHD, with access to
      large quantities of Adderall. Cross-check this list with the names on the
      drug usage record and review them one by one!”
    </p>
    <p>
      After Yan Xie issued the order, the large office belonging to the Criminal
      Investigation Unit was instantly swamped with a sea of case files.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crime solving in real life vastly differed from what was depicted in
      mystery novels. Circumstantial evidence obtained from a crime scene was
      not enough to close a case. The majority of time was spent following up on
      clues and obtaining eyewitness testimonials. The first 48 hours after a
      homicide was also known as the critical hour. If there were no
      breakthroughs within those 48 hours after the crime, then the chances of
      solving the case were greatly decreased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour hand of the large clock hanging on the white wall turned slowly.
      As the sky dimmed, the critical hour passed by in the blink of an eye. The
      steam emitted from cup noodles and the white wisps of cigarette smoke
      mingled in the air to form a misty fog that hung low in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the first ray of daylight broke through the next morning, the door to
      the office was pushed open and Qin Chuan rushed in, slamming the case file
      in his hand right onto Yan Xie’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie was sitting upright behind a pile of case files and was thus
      rudely awakened by Qin Chuan’s action. With a cry of surprise, he jolted
      awake and caught the case file that was thrown at him in a fluster. “What?
      What? Did you find it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hu Weisheng.” In a swift motion, Qin Chuan swiped the case file back and
      flipped it open noisily to display a mugshot of a suspect. “Guilty of
      smuggling and producing counterfeit Adderall, Ritalin and Modafinil
      related drugs, earning a profit of more than fifty thousand RMB. He was
      only released from prison half a year ago. Narcotics arrested a
      nineteen-year-old drug addict who was suffering from withdrawal symptoms
      on the street just last month. He was the son of this guy’s landlord!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie pulled out the surveillance photo obtained from the secondhand
      shop and compared it with the mugshot. “Looks similar. Where’s Ma Xiang?
      Head down to the Traffic Security Bureau and investigate the vehicles
      registered under Hu Weisheng’s name!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma Xiang once again demonstrated his wide array of connections. At half
      past four in the morning, the Traffic Management Bureau responded,
      confirming that the suspect Hu Weisheng had a secondhand white Toyota
      Camry registered under his name and the vehicle was a perfect match with
      the one that appeared at the crime scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s him, the bastard.” Yan Xie rapped the tabletop with his knuckles
      sharply, then pointed his finger at a few spirited young officers.
      “Prepare to track down and drag this Hu Weisheng back here!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The two days and two nights of consecutive overtime had left everyone
      feeling suffocated, especially those like Yan Xie and Qin Chuan who were
      the respective leaders of their units. It had already been two nights
      since they last returned home to get a good night’s sleep. Hence, the
      moment Yan Xie issued the arrest order, the whole unit swarmed out of the
      office and half the team was gone in a flash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie gave Qin Chuan’s shoulder a hearty pat. “It’s been tough on you.
      Our brothers in the Narcotics team also…” He drifted off. The Qin Chuan
      who was still awake 10 seconds ago now had his face plastered against the
      corner of the wall, his glasses askew. It was a completely pure and
      unpretentious posture, and gentle snores whistled through Qin Chuan’s open
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treading with light steps, Yan Xie quietly returned back to his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was already five A.M. in the morning, and the sky was beginning to
      lighten up. Deciding to abandon the idea of sleeping, Yan Xie opened Hu
      Weisheng’s case file to peruse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hu Weisheng was a textbook example of the saying, ‘a child who steals a
      needle will grow up to steal gold’. He had gone through repeated arrests
      from the age of sixteen for petty theft. After he came of age, he moved on
      to stealing purses, mobile phones and electric bicycles, and was
      imprisoned a couple of times as a result. A few years ago, he was involved
      in a more serious case in Gongzhou and was sentenced to 3 years for
      attempted rape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie ran a hand over the stubbles on his chin, then gave a low cry of
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hu Weisheng was a street thief, and his targets were always personal
      belongings. He had no records of breaking and entering. Judging from this
      point alone, he was probably a coward, and the nature of his crimes was
      inherently different from the rape that he was convicted of. This act of
      his that “crossed boundaries” was very suspicious indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Staring at the word ‘Gongzhou’ in the case file, something stirred within
      the depths of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yan-ge.” Suddenly, Ma Xiang poked his head in. “That top chemistry
      student has been detained in the bureau for almost 24 hours. Should we
      release him?”
    </p>
    <p>Yan Xie raised his head in surprise. “What? He’s still here?”</p>
    <p>
      “The forensic team failed to recover any footage from the lab, so we are
      still keeping him detained momentarily. He spent the night sleeping in the
      interrogation room and woke up with a cold this morning, coughing his
      lungs out and hugging onto a tissue box for dear life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurry up and release him, lest he files a complaint against us. By the
      way, instruct him not to leave Jianning during this period and to be in
      constant contact with the police. Remind him to pay attention to the
      legislation involved.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ma Xiang flashed an ‘OK’ sign at Yan Xie and said, “No problem. The top
      student had already said he won’t file a complaint, we just need to hurry
      up and send him back to the lab.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie gave a wave and gestured at Ma Xiang to make a move and close the
      door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a soft click, the office resumed its previous state of stillness at
      the break of dawn. For a while, the only sign of life in the room was the
      blinking yellow light at the bottom right corner of the monitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie tapped out an absent-minded rhythm on the tabletop with his middle
      finger. There was a strange, unsettling feeling in his heart that he was
      unable to shake off as he stewed in silence, deep in thought.
    </p>
    <p>Everything was going too smoothly, he thought to himself.</p>
    <p>
      From the start of the investigation to identifying the car plate number,
      to finding the deceased’s backpack, and then to narrowing down the
      investigation scope to a single suspect based on a deduction that stemmed
      from a very weak logical chain. Two days and three nights had already
      passed, but the investigation was progressing with such ease that it felt
      like there were some underlying details that they had missed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why would an experienced drug dealer who had been selling a novel mix of
      prescription drugs and hallucinogens for a long time suddenly cause a
      death this time around?
    </p>
    <p>How could it be that no accidents had occurred until now?</p>
    <p>
      Was there an error in the formula, or was it that the previous ‘accidents’
      were all inexplicably explained away by various excuses, and it was only
      by chance that the victim had died right before his eyes this time, making
      it impossible for the incident to be suppressed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Switching on the computer, Yan Xie accessed the public security internal
      network. After much deliberation, he entered a string of passwords and
      pulled up the electronic backups of the case files from past years. Then,
      he entered the case file number corresponding to Hu Weisheng’s arrest in
      Gongzhou.
    </p>
    <p>
      The screen transitioned abruptly, bringing to light the case that was
      gathering dust in the recesses of the database. Under the soft morning
      rays of the autumn sunlight, the case details took shape right before Yan
      Xie’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liu Xue, eighteen years old, was a student from a renowned high school in
      Gongzhou.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day before the start of the second mock exam, this third year student
      took advantage of the noon break to sneak out of the school dormitories
      and disappeared for the entire afternoon. That night, the school launched
      a search effort that lasted the entire night but to no avail. Her parents
      lodged a police report the following day. In less than a day, this missing
      persons case attracted the full attention of the local police station and
      was soon transferred over to the district bureau.
    </p>
    <p>The district bureau accepted the case.</p>
    <p>
      The following night, based on a series of investigations, the police found
      an unconscious Liu Xue in an unlicensed clinic.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the subsequent investigation, the suspect Hu Weisheng chanced
      upon Liu Xue when the latter was loitering around on the streets due to
      exam stress. This aroused his evil intent and he immediately lured her
      into the car and drugged her. Unexpectedly, Liu Xue was allergic to the
      drug he administered and she immediately developed a series of symptoms
      such as dizziness and vomiting. She eventually fainted. Hu Weisheng was
      afraid that he would be implicated if an accidental death were to occur,
      so he briskly left her at an unlicensed clinic and left.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nature of this case was ruled as attempted rape. After Liu Xue was
      discharged from the hospital post-treatment, Hu Weisheng was sentenced to
      three years imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Staring at the case file, Yan Xie could not believe his eyes—it was simply
      ruled as such?
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the real cause of the victim’s allergic reaction? What was the
      drug administered? Were there no other reasons for a man to drug a woman
      other than rape? If he really harbored the intention to rape her, then why
      did the rapist panic after she lost consciousness and send her straight to
      a clinic?
    </p>
    <p>
      It had only been less than a month since the case was filed before it was
      referred to the district bureau. There was obviously more to the case than
      meets the eye but the case was inexplicably resolved with such haste. Did
      none of the investigators involved in this case raise their suspicions
      regarding this unusual matter?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yan Xie’s instinct, honed by all the cases he had handled over the past
      decade, led him to possess an extremely keen sense for details. The more
      he thought about this case, the more dubious it seemed. Finally, he gave
      in to the urge and scrolled to the last page for the list of officers
      involved in the case as well as their lead investigator’s name—
    </p>
    <p>His gaze stalled as he froze in place.</p>
    <p>The lead investigator of this case then was called Jiang Ting.</p>
    <p>
      From the depths of his memories, a large shadow surfaced. In that split
      second, the silhouette who repeatedly appeared in Yan Xie’s dreams turned
      around to face him quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the only time the figure did not focus on the mobile phone, nor
      did he skimp on the amount of attention he paid Yan Xie. Daylight streamed
      in through the window, tracing the contours of his striking physique,
      highlighting the handsome planes of his visage, as well as the curve of
      his thin lips that carried a hint of coldness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness, his half-lidded gaze was directed at Yan Xie, clear and
      unwavering.
    </p>
    <p>“…”</p>
    <p>
      It felt like there was an intangible hand seizing Yan Xie by the throat,
      trapping his breath in his chest with nowhere to escape, causing his own
      hands to tremble. Before he could get ahold of his senses, he had already
      entered the internal network database and retrieved the list of key
      leaders of Gongzhou City’s Public Security Bureau from that year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gongzhou Narcotics Unit Second Team Captain Jiang Ting. His name was
      encased in a conspicuous black frame. He was confirmed to have sacrificed
      himself in the line of duty 3 years ago.
    </p>
    <p>A large explosion went off in Yan Xie’s mind.</p>
    <p>
      The man who sat on the bench and smiled at him by the roadside yesterday.
      The same man who was currently staring coldly at him through the computer
      screen, clad in a navy blue uniform, with three four-pointed stars
      studding his shoulders, his distinctive features displayed in full view.
